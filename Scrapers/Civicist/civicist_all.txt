The civic tech story isnt your average fairy tale. Theres no easy road where three clicks get you where youre going. Its a complicated landscape with multiple plotlines and more dragons than Munchkins.
The Personal Democracy Forum conference has always been a celebration of technologys role transforming politics and redefining democracy. But this years celebration included particularly strong notes of caution, like danah boyds talk on the unintended consequences of code, Mark Surmans warning that internet freedom is shrinking and Mariana Ruiz Firmats reminder that equity within our organizations is a design imperative, not just a good hiring practice.
The chorus of realistic voices was my second favorite thing about PDF16. My favorite was our own cautionary panel, Is the Civic Tech Story Broken?, which I presented with panelists Sam Dorman, Elizabeth Eagen and Shaifali Puri.
In the panel description, we said:
We have an expectations problem in the civic tech world that is making donors waste money and social justice projects waste opportunities. When foundations and executives expect technology to create rapid results, or massive results, they can set up their tools and their teams to fall short. And simplistic expectations mess up the incentives for advocates and donors alike. Advocates will keep talking like tech utopians even when they know better, to secure funds; and donors will smooth over tech projects that underperform, to tell an easier story to their boards and their peers.
To fix these mismatches in expectations, civic tech needs a better story. One that celebrates not just innovation but alignment between donor missions, tool designs, and local impacts. One that rescues the word learning from the stigmas of evaluation and failure and gets people across the civic tech ecosystem to celebrate project shortfalls for what they teach us about not repeating our mistakes. Our panel of experts from the tech and donor communities will come with good and bad stories from the expectations gap, and well work with session attendees to brainstorm new stories that will help civic tech strengthen its realism and its civic conscience.

Our central message was that the expectations surrounding civic tech are not aligned with the realities of how it takes holdor doesnt. We expect that new tools will transform organizations, but too often projects stall on non-tech challenges, or teams lack the person-power to make a new system thrive. We go big on big data, expecting citizens and governments to reboot their relationship, then go home disappointed when the realities of power relationships and bureaucracy slow down the new age.
The panel was determined to do more than complain, though. We, and later our audience, brought ideas for bridging the civic tech expectations gap. We talked about how our community can change the civic tech story from one that assumes transformation to one that anticipates challenges.
To add context to the discussion, I compared the struggles of civic tech to previous cycles of idealism and shortfall, for blogs in 2006, for instance, or for social media in 2010. In both those cases, civic groups learned that breakthrough tools still need bread-and-butter planning to create lasting change.
We use utopian shorthand too often when we promote the potential of civic tech. And simplistic expectations can mess up the incentives, especially for grantmakers, who are already prone to following the tech hype of the month, as Esraa Al-Shafei put it in her PDF talk. Fortunately, some donors are trying to take a longer look at the progress of civic tech. The day before, we heard from Omidyar Networks Stacy Donohue about the absence of a shared vision for civic techs purpose and role.
Our panel included two experienced funders, from the Open Society Foundations and the Nike Foundation. Elizabeth Eagen of the OSF Information Program said that a thoughtful design phase for data-driven programs can make the difference between success and unmet expectations in technology grants and technology projects.
Be clear on the hypotheses you are supposed to be testing, she said, and understand how nuances in project goals can actually represent huge differences in aims. The general plan to build a database, for example, might mean gathering data and making it more usable, but might just as easily mean conducting pilot work and capacity development to determine the availability of data and the readiness of a grantee to use that data for advocacy. The lesson: Dont settle for broadly-defined goals. Spend time on design to be clearand realisticabout your hypothesis.
Elizabeth added that it may take more paperwork to fund a thoughtful design phasesince the final goals wont be clear at the outset, but the extra planning is worth it, especially because technology can easily impinge on human rights in the effort to protect them.
Shaifali Puri, who led global innovation for the Nike Foundation, said we need tech grantmaking that is more utilitarian and less utopian. If human experience is full of power imbalances, she said, then civic tech has a cultural imperative to be aware of existing infrastructures, or it risks reinforcing them. Shaifali recommended donor groups look more honestly at their failures, to avoid more projects where the impact happens in spite of the tech.
Sam Dorman pointed to the tension between funding cost-efficient technology experiments and investing at the higher levels that can help assure success. He said organizational capacity, which is often ignored entirely in funder initiatives, is one of the key differentiators between successful and unsuccessful technology. Internal capacity and thoughtful planning were also at the heart of Sams talk the previous day on the PDF main stage. When the social sector builds tech products, he argued, on some level our organizations become tech companies. We need to invest a comparable level of care if we want these products to remain effective.
So while the civic tech story may not be completely broken, we all agreed that stories of difficulty, stories of failure and stories drawn from the demand side of civic needsand not just the supply side of great toolsshould be more visible and more shareable among us.
To walk the talk of story-sharing, we opened the topic to our audience using the super-low-tech platform of index cards. We asked for specific examples of tech projects that struggled with an expectations gap, and examples or ideas for how organizations, donors and technologists can narrow the gap. Four responses from the dozen or so we received are captured here.
Craig Sinclair described the roadblocks that the CMDrupal project faced after launching tools to support Community Media Centers. Even though the platform enabled each center to tailor the modules to their needs, this option to customize made it too complex/expensive, so only the largest center deployed the project. (Thats Sams internal capacity challenge seen in the wild.)
Even though his work has garnered two awards from New York Citys BigApps contest, Joel Natividad said, I found civic tech so much harder than I thought: Depleted savings, tapped home equity, kited credit cards, raised money from friends, family, and VCs didnt understand.
Joel singled out the government procurement process as a major roadblock in the spread of civic techechoing comments by Elizabeth during the panel and a blog by Tom Steinbergthat helped to inspire the session.  Government is ripe for innovation, he said, but government tech is built and delivered by the government-contractor complex ... procurement, bureaucracy, politics, regulatory capture and the election cycle make it so hard.
Lawrence Grodeska of Civicmakers advised governments and organizations to adopt the Service Design model, to help tackle civic challenges in a more holistic way, builds with not for, and ensures theres a seat at the table for design thinking from the outset of any project.
Designer, director and sometime techie Andrew James Benson speculated that an organization like PDF could become an impact-oriented convener of founders and organizations to assert common goals, like the Millennium Development Goals for civic tech.
As we struggle to tell a civic tech story grounded in realistic but ambitious expectations, the Millennium Development Goals arent a bad place to look for inspirationspecifically because they didnt deliver all the results promised, and because their 2.0 release, the Sustainable Development Goals have prompted a timely conversation on the power of data andthe power of inclusion.
My own prescriptions for a healthier civic tech story included the example set by Civic Hall Labs, who made sure to include failures in their recent field guide, and a more radical wish that all our scattered stories of collaboration, innovation and unmet expectations could be easier to find and share, perhaps using a model like the Humanitarian Exchange Language.
Like the PDF conference, the civic tech community has never been more diverse in the backgrounds and perspectives of its members. Now that weve grown out of the blind enthusiasm stage of civic tech, we ought to be able to bring that same enthusiasm to a less simplistic, but equally intriguing story.

Tech and politics: Brian Barrett has a must-read piece in Wired about how Americas electronic voting machines could be hacked this November. Three-quarters of the country votes via paper ballots, he notes and only five (DE, GA, LA, SC and NJ) rely exclusively on direct recording electronic machines, while others do so partially, like Pennsylvania. Not every state has a provision for conducting a post-election audit to insure confidence in the results, though three that could be swing statesFL, OH and PAdo have relatively strong audit rules on the books.


As security analyst Bruce Schneier pointed out last week in the Washington Post, Russian hackers could disrupt the election not only by interfering with electronic voting machines, but also by deleting voter records, among other tactics.


Given that a national voter file with 191 million individual records on it appeared online last December, security experts worry that it would not be difficult for hackers to target state-level voter records to selectively purge people.


So, while Republican ignominee Donald Trump has started warning that the November election might be rigged against him, an unprecedented charge that may undermine confidence in the results, theres also reason to fear that it might be disrupted from abroad.

And he was right, because that thing has millions and millions and millions of hits. For a while, during the Republican primary debates, they had Sanders dictate the campaigns reaction tweets. Goodstein said, The best part of that entire thing, in my opinion, was one tweet where he was like, You know what, Ive had enough of this. Im going to bed.

Tech and politics: Donald Trump may be a master of Twitter, but Hillary Clinton gained more Twitter followers during her party convention compared to Trump during his, George Washington Universitys PEORIA Project reports. Writing for Medium, GWU professor Michael Cohen notes that Trump gained 159,536 followers while Clinton gained 191,767. For Clinton that was a 2.4% increase over her starting base nearly 8 million compared to Trumps 1.6% increase on nearly 10 million. Clintons tweets were retweeted 741,000 times compared to 470,000 for Trump, during their respective conventions. She also had more total engagement with her followers. Cohens hypothesis, which is shared by his colleague Michael Cornfield, is that during the convention Clinton gained more Sanders followers than Trump gained followers from all his Republican rivals.

Facebooks Safety Check feature was activated last Friday for the sixth time in only six weeks. The tool was triggered in Orlando after the Pulse attack, during the explosion at Istanbuls airport, after a truck bombing in Baghdad, for the Dallas police shooting, again in Nice, France, and most recently in Munich, Germany, after a deadly attack at a shopping mall. Since Facebook initiated Safety Check during the terrorist attack in Paris last yearthe first time it was used for a non-natural disasteruse of the feature has skyrocketed. Safety Check has been activated at least 30 times since January alone, more than twice the number of activations in 2014 and 2015 combined.
This is partly because Safety Check can now be community-generated. Rather than relying on Facebook employees to manually activate the feature, last months update allows the platforms algorithms to initiate the check if a critical mass of users are posting about a crisis in a specific location. While the new community-generated feature distances the company from the responsibility of choosing when to activate or not, Facebook engineers still determine the critical mass of users that will trigger the tool.
These changes allow for greater community ownership of activating Safety Check, Tom Trewinnard, a business development manager in collaborative and multilingual web applications at Meedan Labs, told Civicist on Wednesday.
When asked about the critical mass of users necessary to activate Facebooks algorithms, Trewinnard said, This is, of course, the next issuewho decides which communities can activate Safety Check and what will be the impact of implicit bias in that process? Facebook has moved from vetting crises to vetting communities who vet crises: that seems like a step in the right direction, though I can certainly imagine further delegation of that responsibility being possible and desirable.
Safety Check has undergone multiple iterations since its launch in 2014. The tool was originally meant to connect Facebook users in the aftermath of natural disasters, a simple and easy way to say youre safe and check on others. When Safety Check is activated, users in the affected area receive a notification asking whether or not they are safe and if they have friends also impacted by the conflict. Their responses are automatically shared within their networks.
When Facebook first activated the feature during last years shooting in Paris, many critics asked why they activated it then, but not for similar attacks in Lebanon, Turkey, or Nigeria that occurred in prior months. Safety Checks absence outside of Paris play[ed] into a broader narrative of a perceived lack of media attention and care for disasters and crises that happen outside of the US and Western Europe, said Trewinnard. Critics pointed out that Facebook developers are ill-equipped to distinguish crises worthy of Safety Check from those that are not.
Laurenellen McCann, director of New America DC and one of Times 30 People Under 30 Changing the World, echoed Trewinnards concerns on her blog. When Facebook lets you mark yourself safe in Paris but not in Beirut, Facebook indicates to us how THEY think about the world and reveals the bias in the experience they bring to us. They reveal what they think about tragedy andI think its fair to saythey reveal their biases about whose lives count.
In 2015, Facebooks vice president of growth, Alex Schultz, defended Facebooks decision to activate the check in Paris and not for the other attacks. During an ongoing crisis, like war or epidemic, Safety Check in its current form is not that useful for people: because there isnt a clear start or end point and, unfortunately, its impossible to know when someone is truly safe Schultz wrote.
Now, after recognizing the criticism from the past two years, the company appears to be deferring more to their users when it comes to crisis identification and response. Over the past few months, we have improved the launch process to make it easier for our team to activate more frequently and faster, while testing ways to empower people to identify and elevate local crises as well, a Facebook spokesperson told Fast Company in early July. By making Safety Check community-activated, Facebook is doing more to empower people on the ground, but also appeasing critics and shelving responsibility.
Wayan Vota, editor of ICTworks.org, an online community for people using emerging technologies for international development, was very critical of Facebooks crisis identification process early on. There is a very slippery moral slope in determining what is a disaster, especially from the safe confines of Silicon Valley. I dont feel comfortable leaving it up to Facebook to decide which disasters are worthy of social media support or not, he wrote on his organizations site.
In an email to Civicist this week, Vota said he approved of Safety Checks newest update, but wants to see coordination with local emergency response groups.
The Red Cross considers community members themselves as the true first-responders to emergencies. Facebooks new community-centric Safety Check update is a great step in that direction, he wrote. A next step could be integrating alerts to the Red Cross and other local responders when Facebooks algorithms show a Safety Check launch.
I believe we should be building digital tools that allow users to self-identify what is an issue for them, and self-organize their response, Vota said to Civicist.
What remains crucial, according to Tom Trewinnard, is Facebooks commitment to the tool, especially if Safety Check becomes integrated into crisis response practices as Vota suggested. Trewinnard asked, Is Facebook committed to maintaining availability of this feature for the long term? Is Facebooka corporation subject to the whims of global markets and shareholders, accompanied by a corporate lack of transparencythe best owner of this kind of tool?

Case Study: First leaders debate livestreamed on Facebook Country: Australia  Debate: June 17, 2016

In June 2016, less than a month before Australias federal election, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, head of the Coalition Party, challenged Labor Party Leader Bill Shorten to a different style of debateone that would be aired chiefly on Facebook, with viewers posting comments as it happened.
The two men had, by this point, already met twice. The first debate, the Sky News / Daily Telegraphs peoples forum in western Sydney on May 13, was conducted town hall-style in front of 100 undecided voters. It attracted a small television audiencearound 54,000, according to reports (Sky News is a paid-subscription channel). At the end, the studio audience declared Shorten the winner: 42-29, with 29 people still unsure who to support.
The second debate, a National Press Club event in Canberra on May 29 organized by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was carried on two ABC channels (but no commercial stations) and drew a combined average viewing audience of 628,000. It was a more staid affair: A panel of journalists asked the questions, and the candidates were permitted to speak without interruption from the panelists or the other candidate.
With candidates sticking mostly to talking points, despite the panelists efforts to elicit more in-depth responses, the second debate was roundly criticized as lackluster. Phillip Coorey, the Australian Financial Reviews chief political correspondent, wrote that the event cast fresh doubt on the future of what has been an election campaign staple amid concerns it has become a tired and obsolete format.
Paula Matthewson, a communications adviser and columnist, went further, noting that both men ended up as marionette versions of themselves, awkwardly posturing on the stage with stilted voices and pantomime expressions.
There was no trace of the former barrister Turnbull, the most skilled and compelling orator in the Federal Parliament, or any sign of the former union leader Shorten, whose inspiring stump speeches could deftly rally the troops, she added. Even more disappointingly, the over-engineering of the leaders performances treated debate viewers to an hour-long display of contemporary journalisms greatest frustration: the non sequitur interview, in which politicians answer every question with a totally unrelated set of talking points.
Less than a week later, with the election tightening, Turnbull rejected an invite from Sky View for another peoples forum, possibly because he thought the questions during the first event had favored his opponent. Shorten accepted and had the stage to himself; he called Turnbulls no-show an insult to Queenslanders.
But Turnbull had another plan to reach voters, especially those in areas where the race might be tight. Theres no mandate in Australia for the number of debates, though traditionally there are three. Turnbull wanted the next and presumably final debate to engage a wider audience on smartphones and other mobile devices, so he proposed staging the next debate onlinespecifically on Facebook Live, with the live feed made available to broadcastersa first for a leaders debate in Australia.
These are the platforms that many people, many would say most Australians, see most of their media on, most of their news, and I think its important that we have an innovative election and that we use the platforms that Australians use, said Turnbull.
This debate will enable millions of Australians to participate. They will be able to contribute. It will engage a vastly wider audience than the formats that weve used before, he added. My aim is to have as big an audience as possible and to reach everyone, you have got to use the devices which I noticed you are all holding in your hands. Thats the modern world. 
Some of that statement was correct. In a country of an estimated 24 million, more than 14 million people use Facebook, and more people (44 percent, according to a 2015 study) cite the internet as their main source of news ahead of TV, radio, and print.
But in terms of audience engagement, the debate would run up modest numbers when it streamed on Facebook Live, though the numbers continued to grow in the days afterward. And the point the debate ended up making about technology and access wasnt the one Turnbull intended.
A New Social Format
The 45-minute debate was staged at Facebook Australias headquarters in Sydney. It started at 6 p.m. on a Friday eveningnot the best time to capture voters attention. Hosted by news.com.au, owned by News Corp Australia, the livestream could be viewed at Facebook.com/news.com.au and on the news.com.au website. The television channels Sky News and ABC24 also carried the feed.
At Facebook, our mission is to make the world more open and connected and we are excited about the potential to connect so many Australians in one of the most important aspects of any election campaigna leadership debate, said Stephen Scheeler, managing director of Facebook Australia.
Daniel Sankey, editor of news.com.au, said that the Facebook Live platform will give all Australians the ability to not just watch, but to actively participate, in the debate.
The news site reported that more than 4 million Facebook users saw its posts promoting the debate, and more than 3,000 questions for the prime minister and the opposition leader were submitted in advance. The final questions were selected from these advance submissions and from new comments submitted during the debate, as well as from a small studio audience.  
Joe Hildebrand, a morning talk show host, brought a giddy energy to his role as moderator. He kicked off the event by taking viewers on a brief tour of Facebooks headquarters, pointing out the gold-colored walls and the roomful of producers and moderators from Facebook and news.com.au tasked with combing through comments.
Hildebrand told viewers watching that if they wanted to get their question to either the prime minister or the opposition leader, certainly one of whom will be the future prime minister on the night of July 2, the comment should stand out.
That means no spam, no trolling, no abuse, thats boring, weve seen it all before, he warned. Get exciting, get adventurous, and really tell us about what matters to you, and if youre funny well give you double points.
Cameras followed Hildebrand into the room where the debate would be held. He walked through the studio audience of 30 undecided voters selected from more than a dozen marginal seatsdistricts that could go either waypausing to ask a few people about the issues that matter most to them. Childcare, education costs, health care, and marriage equality were cited.
Andrew Bucklow, an entertainment reporter with news.com.au, delivered a final reminder for Facebook users: Those watching on news.com.aus Facebook page could share their reactions by clicking, as often as they wanted, on one of Facebooks emojis. Agree? Give a thumbs up, or a heart. Upset by what youre hearing? Post a sad or angry face.
Turnbull and Shorten then entered the room and shook hands. They perched casually atop stools on either side of Hildebrand, who again emphasized the newness of the debate, calling it fresh and youth-oriented. Ground rules allowed 90 seconds to answer each question until the final round, when the leaders would have 60 seconds to respond.
After pleading with both men to avoid cliched talking points, Hildebrand said: This is not the press gallery youre talking to anymore, these are the real people out there who quite frankly, they dont take crap. You know that. We all know that. Let get started.
The Debate Begins
And with that, Hildebrand read the first question from Facebookon why voters should trust politicianswhich sounded a lot like a question asked at the National Press Club debate. But more variation followed, from both the public and the candidates.
The next three questionsone more from Facebook and two from the studio audienceaddressed affordable housing, climate change, and shift workers. The selected questions honed close to issues identified in news.com.aus State of the Nation Survey, which identified the cost of living as the top concern, and Facebook data on the most-mentioned election topics.
Hildebrand initially described himself as merely a conduit for the publics questions, but he asked smart follow-up questions when time allowed, continuing to push for specific responses.
After the fourth question, Hildebrand turned to Bucklow of news.com.au for an update on viewer reactions.
The most popular reaction so far is actually anger, said Bucklow, but a lot of comments flowing through, as youd expect. A couple of cheeky comments about the NBN, some people saying this stream would be far more watchable if we had NBN.
That was the first inkling the party leaders got that all might not be going well for Facebook Live viewers.
Only as Good as the Bandwidth
The NBN stands for the National Broadband Network. Its a major infrastructure project to deliver fast broadband that has seen cost overruns and delays through several different administrations. Indeed, many online viewers were reporting choppy video with periods of buffering, sending angry emojis flying across the screen and posting images on Twitter of what the debate looked like.

A Facebook spokesperson later told Mashable: We thoroughly tested all aspects of our product on different devices with people located around the country both before and during the debate and were not able to identify any issues with the livestream at our end.
The debate quickly resumed after Bucklows update. Hildebrand, picking up an iPad, read a newly selected Facebook question for the prime minister on whether reducing taxes on companies would increase employment. A question from the audience about youth unemployment followed. Shorten responded by discussing Labors plan for increasing jobs and apprenticeships, then steered the conversation back to NBN, noting that a vibrant economy needs first-class technology and good infrastructure.
Turnbull countered that his party had inherited a failed project, yet the government had greatly accelerated the number of people connected to NBN and would complete the project by 2019 or 2020.
But Shorten wasnt done, and he made one more pitchthis time directly to Facebook users. 
If I could use the Facebook system we have here, I would just like to see people press like if they would prefer to have fiber than copper, said Shorten. Im interested to see what Facebook users who have bad connections and delays and bufferingMalcom Turnbull says everythings fine. Lets press like if you prefer fiber to copper.

At that moment, those watching the Facebook video saw a non-stop parade of thumbs-up emojis.
Turnbull and Shorten continued to talk over each other, debating whose party bore more responsibility for the projects slow pace and cost. 
The facts are pretty unpleasant, whatever side of politics youre on, said Hildebrand, finally moving the candidates on to another question from Facebook about mental health funding.
Then, for a second time, the debate paused to consider the latest online feedback. Standing before an enlarged screen with a live scroll of Facebook comments, Bucklow said Shortens appeal to viewers about the NBN had resulted in like becoming the most popular reaction.
Bucklow also noted that a number of comments were also coming in about jobs, and he read several of those out loud. The extent of the frustration online was not processed.
The final section of the debate called for Turnbull and Shorten to limit their answers to 60 seconds, but Hildebrand allowed for a lively dialogue around a new Facebook question on marriage equality (the questions exact wording: What the hell are we waiting for?). Both Turnbull and Shorten support same-sex marriage but have different approaches to making it law. An audience question on the affordability of higher education sparked another discussion.
The debate wound down with two more newly added questions from Facebookone concerning parliamentary perks, and the other on the candidates mid-range vision for Australia.
The total question count by the end of the 45-minute debate: Three questions had been submitted to Facebook in advance, four were pulled from Facebook during the debate, and four came from the studio audience.
Winners and Losers
Members of the studio audience voted Shorten the winner, 17-7 (the other six people may have remained undecided). The consensus among political reports and analysts was that Shorten came out ahead, though some thought it was a close call.
David Crowe, a political correspondent for the Australian, wrote that Shorten got the better of Turnbull by using clever tactics and an aggressive message to win the moment.
Katharine Murphy, who live blogged the debate for The Guardian, said Shorten delivered a feisty performance: a few left hooks, a couple of risks, some high visibility contrast with his opponent, some assertive negativity.
But the prime minister didnt stumble, she added, didnt take any wrong turns, he just followed the battle plan: Keep it tight and tidy, stick with the messages, be reassuring, and all will be well on polling day. Lets see how that all goes.
All wasnt well on polling day. The race was so close that it seemed unlikely at first that the Coalition Party would win enough seats to form a majority government. But almost one week after the July 2 election, Shorten conceded defeat.

The Numbers and Beyond
Fifteen minutes into first online leaders debate, Facebook showed around 12,400 viewers. The livestream appeared to peak about 30 minutes later, with around 13,400 viewers. When the debate ended, 36,000 comments, 10,000 reactions, and nearly 1,100 shares had been logged. 
According to Facebook, the debate had 160,000 views by 8:15 p.m.a little more than two hours after the startwith a total newsfeed reach that night of 1.6 million.
If those figures are correct, even if theyre only half correct, it shows that the debate has reached a lot more people than it normally would, Andrea Carson, a University of Melbourne lecturer in media and politics, told the universitys Election Watch.
The video ultimately reached 800,000 views before the election, along with 40,000 comments and 2,400 shares. A review of the 16,000 reactions reveals 11,000+ likes; 2,400+ angry faces; 1,600+ hearts; 568 laughs; 338 wows; and 286 sad faces.
Despite the engagement of Facebook users, Carson noted that more could still be done to increase interaction between the voters and the candidates.
I think it was a little overhyped about how innovative this would be, added Carson. The innovation was being able to reach different audiences but the format wasnt all that innovative, it was what weve seen before with town hall debates.
I like that format, thats a good way of broadening it out and making it beyond the gatekeepers, but they didnt make use of the fact it was live and interactivethey had Joe Hildebrand reading out the questions rather than using a video of the questioner. They still had intermediaries in place.
Shorten at least recognized these limitations; immediately after the debate, he offered to stick around and answer questions that werent selected for the livestream.

Our Micah Sifry reports from the Democratic convention that the Clinton digital team, with its new Farmville/Hay Day/Tiny Tower-inspired campaign app, aims to make mobile participation fun, and to have fun with Trump when they can. I think if we can distract him for 15 minutes a day, I take that as a win, said digital director Jenna Lowenstein during a Politico/Microsoft event Tuesday. A video that we took an hour putting together hell be thinking about for 36 hours. It appears easy to get under his skin.


In the New York Times feature Room for Debate, Micah writes that third party candidates arent going to impact the election much unless either Jill Stein of the Green Party or Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party passes the 15 percent threshold, the percentage of national electorate support needed to get on the debate stage. But even if that doesnt happen, they could still leave their mark. Major parties have always responded to third-party challenges by co-opting their top issues, Micah writes. Thats how smaller parties have managed to change the direction of the country.


Mr. Thiels endorsement puts him at odds with many Silicon Valley chief executives and investors who oppose Mr. Trump on issues like climate change, same-sex marriage and, of course, immigration (they want more visas available for software engineers), Noam Cohen writes in the opinion pages of the New York Times. But Mr. Thiel [is] deeply embedded in the worldview of Silicon Valley that, despite many disagreements with the Republican platform, matches up surprisingly well with Mr. Trumps ideas about fixing government.
Silicon Valley doesnt hate government categorically, Cohen continued. When Mr. Thiel harked back to the great projects of the past, like building the atom bomb, creating the internet and landing a man on the moon, he was citing three of the most important United States government initiatives of the last century. He praised them in his speech for inspiring the tech dreamers of Silicon Valley, who today inspire America to be great again...Mr. Trumps appeal to someone like Mr. Thiel is that they both believe that government should be brash and bold, while politics as usual produces tame mediocrity. They also believe they are the right kind of people to change that.


Thomas Friedman writes for the New York Times opinion section that this election is a battle between Web People and Wall People. Wall People, Friedman writes, want someone to turn off the violent winds of change at work, in their neighborhoods, and in every city around the globe where violence is threatening safety and stability. Both Trump and Sanders speak to the Wall People.
Web People on the other hand, know that a 21st-century party needs to build its platform in response to the accelerations in technology, globalization and climate change, which are the forces transforming the workplace, geopolitics and the very planet...As such, the instinct of Web People is to embrace the change in the pace of change and focus on empowering more people to be able to compete and collaborate in a world without walls. In particular, Web People understand that in times of rapid change, open systems are always more flexible, resilient and propulsive; they offer the chance to feel and respond first to change. The Clintons and Tim Kaine, a Web Person with a soul, are of this camp, although Clinton hasnt stuck to her Web People guns the way Friedman would have liked her to.


D.C. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel has said that late night ridership has gone down as a result of car service apps like Uber and Lyft, David Alpert reports for Greater Greater Washington, a fact he uses to defend proposed changes to permanently roll back service hours on weekends to end at midnight. Where that leaves the workers at the bars, restaurants, and other nightlife spots who are catering to the Uber/Lyft-taking crowd is TDB.


A New Yorker has proposed turning a homeless encampment into a Pokestop to draw attention to the problem, Katie Honan reports for DNAinfo.

The most interesting tech news to come out of the Democratic convention so far is the launch of the Hillary Clinton campaigns new mobile app. The campaigns digital director, Jenna Lowenstein, describes it as a field office in your pocket. Designed to give people in non-battleground states concrete actions they can do that will help the campaign win, the appwhich is available here on iTunesaims to gamify the process of voter mobilization.
Every day, users get four challenges, such as checking in for an organizing event, sharing a post or video to get the word out, filling out a commit-to-vote card, or sharing insights from policy quizzes with family or friends. Then they compete against everyone else in their social network on a common leader-board, with winners offered bonuses like signed campaign merchandise and special campaign updates from senior officials.
The welcome screen for the Hillary 2016 app
If those asks seem somewhat pedestrian, thats because this app isnt about getting campaign supporters to take on the traditional tasks of phone-banking or going door-knocking. (The campaign is using and building those tools, too.) Rather, its aimed at tapping into a wider pool of latent supporters who may get motivated to do more by first playing along with some easier asks. Campaign sources say it was inspired by popular games like Farmville, Hay Day, Neko Astume, and Tiny Tower, and is designed to fit into supporters busy schedules.
Its features sync up with Twitter, Facebook, and SMS, and will be continually updated over the course of the campaign, campaign officials say. Members of its design team include senior product manager Stephanie Cheng, who most recently co-founded the mobile game company Kooapps; senior product designer Denny McFadden, who led product design at charity:water before joining the campaign; director of mobile Bruno de Carvalho, who was head of mobile at Livestream and Timehop; and developer Matt Vermaak, who worked for Grubhub/Seamless.
Speaking at a Politico/Microsoft event Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia titled Digital Campaigns: How Can Democrats Win With Tech?, Clinton digital director Jenna Lowenstein said that the Hillary 2016 app was only two days old but already getting really positive feedback. Indeed, as of Tuesday evening, its overall rating in the iTunes store was four and a half stars out of five, across 463 user ratings.
Challenge cards from the Hillary 2016 mobile app
There were few other revelations about tech and the campaign at the Politico/Microsoft event, as campaign professionals Lowenstein; Keegan Goudiss, the director of digital advertising for Bernie 2016; Betsy Hoover of 270 Strategies (which is advising the Clinton campaign); and Stuart Trevelyan, the CEO of NGP VAN, did their best to project a unified and optimistic view of the Democratic national operation and to disparage the efforts of their Republican opponents on the same playing field. Nor did they have much to say about the latest hacking scandal other than promising that campaigns, which are heavily dependent on collecting and analyzing voter data, would do all they could to protect that data from electronic thieves.
That said, Lowenstein offered one very telling anecdote about how the Clinton campaign is responding to Donald Trumps use of technology, or rather, his use of social media. Someone said that their favorite thing about the Trump-Clinton Twitter war is that hes obsessed with it and she has no idea its happening, she half-joked, adding, Hes a serious threat.
But Lowenstein let on that her digital colleagues were enjoying the opportunity to disrupt the focus on the Trump campaigns biggest asset, that being the attention of the candidate himself. I think if we can distract him for 15 minutes a day, I take that as a win. A video that we took an hour putting together hell be thinking about for 36 hours. It appears easy to get under his skin.

If you dont have anything nice to say, dont put it in an email: The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announced that she would resign on Sunday after leaked emails revealed that Schultz had worked with other party officials to undermine Hillary Clintons rival Bernie Sanders during the primary, Anne Gearan, Philip Rucker, and Abby Phillip report for the Washington Post. The emails also included insulting messages about some of the partys big donors.


Alive and well: Some evidence shows that the source of the email dump was the work of a Russian intelligence group, orchestrated by the Russian government, Patrick Tucker reports for Defense One. This has all the hallmarks of tradecraft. The only rationale to release such data from the Russian bulletproof host was to empower one candidate against another. The Cold War is alive and well, Tom Kellermann, the CEO of Strategic Cyber Ventures, told Defense One.


The Clinton campaign has launched a Farmville-inspired campaign app to gamify the election, Brian Heater reports for TechCrunch.

Peter Thiel doesnt care about clerks and shopkeepers, Gideon Lewis-Kraus writes for the New York Times Magazine. He cannot sympathize with the cook who might stake his or her self-image on having Castro Streets best naan. For him, there is only the Zarathustran heroism of clawing from null bis eins, of escaping the herdlike mentality of das Mann for the freedom of the Ubermensch. Thiel, who cant resist any chance to deride universities, does not want to see intelligence as itself a fixed costsomething in which an institution might investbecause he simply believes that a person is either creative and courageous and worthwhile or he is not. The question the public should be asking, Lewis-Kraus concludes, is how representative Thiels beliefs are of Silicon Valley on the whole.


Meanwhile, Voxs Timothy B. Lee hypothesizes that Peter Thiel doesnt himself believe in Donald Trump, he just wants to see explosive political disruption in Washington. Lee points out that just two years ago Thiel said Trump was symptomatic of everything that is wrong with New York City.


ICYMI: Elizabeth Stoycheff and Erik C. Nisbet write that the internet is detrimental to democratization efforts, because of its power to distract users. According to their study, Those who spent more of their online time engaging with entertainment content were more satisfied with living under autocratic conditions. These users were happy with the authoritarian elites who oversaw them and were uninspired by the prospects of greater freedom. In other words, online political use enhanced democratic attitudes, while online entertainment use entrenched authoritarian ones. And it gets worse.

Challenges in civic tech: Code for Americas Brigade program was singled out in a recent Omidyar Network and Purpose report as being one of the primary drivers of geographic diversification in civic tech. However, as I report for Civicist, the program is halfway through a months-long redesign process, prompted by longstanding frustrations within its volunteer leadership and the need to find a more sustainable model.


L.A. announced it will be participating in the Google Government Innovation Lab, or Angels Lab, where teams will work with Google in five impact areas to reach ambitious goals or moonshots, as Jason Shueh reports for Government Technology magazine.


ICYMI, or Trumps marathon acceptance speech obliterated it from your memory, Peter Thiel spoke at the Republican convention last night, and used the floppy disks that U.S. defense agencies still use (yes, really) to explain why government is broken, Kashmir Hill reports for Fusion. On the one hand, just like in Battlestar Galactica, old systems are hard to hack and a good security measure; on the other, the DoD is planning to ditch the floppies by 2017.


Writing for The Intercept, Sam Biddle pointed out some of the glaring instances of hypocrisy in his speech. Where I work in Silicon Valley, its hard to see where America has gone wrong...We dont accept... incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government, Thiel said. Of course, even the briefest survey of Silicon Valley reveals a culture that is rife with incompetence, where the basic rules youd follow running a lemonade stand  taking in more than you spend, for example, or adhering to basic quality standards  are discarded in favor of explosive growth and runaway valuations, Biddle counters, noting that Thiel also left out the part where the Silicon Valley bubble, puffed up by VCs like Thiel himself, is slowly deflating.


Lisa Abeyta reports for Inc. on how private companies are profiting off of FOIA.


Civic Hall member Maria Yuan writes in the Huffington Post that with both presidential nominees speaking out about money in politics (after Bernie Sanders passed the torch to Hillary Clinton), now is the time to pressure representatives into supporting campaign finance reform laws.


A Wall Street Journal reporters says that Homeland Security demanded access to her mobile phones when she was going through immigration at the L.A. airport, Joseph Cox reports for Motherboard.


Edward Snowden is working with a hardware hacker named Andrew Huang to prevent smartphones from making transmissions that give away more information than they want, potentially putting their activist or journalist owners in danger, Micah Lee reports for The Intercept.

Come on now were marching to the sea Got a revolution Got to revolution Who will take it from you?  We will and who are we? We are volunteers of America Jefferson Airplane
Americas civic tech army is experiencing some growing pains.
Since its launch in 2012, Code for Americas volunteer-led Brigade program has become one of the most influential civic tech bodies in the country, with chapters in 80 cities and tens of thousands of volunteer participants. A recent study by the Omidyar Network and Purpose found that the majority of grassroots civic tech activities in the U.S. over the past few years have been associated with Code for America (CfA) and that the Brigade networkwhich costs CfA more than a million dollars a year to runhas largely driven the geographic diversification of civic tech, from hubs in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia to outposts in places like Wichita, Kansas, and Birmingham, Alabama. If you wanted evidence that civic tech is spreading, the CfA Brigade program has been Exhibit A.
But after five years, the program is getting redesigned, prompted both by longstanding frustrations within its volunteer leadership as well as the need to find a more sustainable model. Brigades challenges have taken on increased urgency because CfA suffered from a fundraising shortfall last year, as CfA founder and executive director Jennifer Pahlka explained in an email to Brigade organizers at the end of December. (Her email, and others to the organizer listserv, can be found in Code for Americas Brigade program Google group.) Meanwhile, in part because of the budget crunch at headquarters, brigades have been operating since the beginning of this year without the stipends from CfA that have helped support meetings and events in previous years.
Pahlka addressed these issues in her end-of-year missive to Brigade captains and core team members, writing:
I dont think we have been as open and transparent with you as we should be, but more importantly, we have long needed to share more openly the opportunities and challenges of the Brigade program, and invite the community to be a part of the solution in the coming year and beyond.

Later in the same email she added:
I know that we have made some clumsy attempts at things like better alignment between the Brigades and the other CfA work and long-term sustainability for the program. A number of times we have communicated direction to the Brigades that was not entirely thought through on our end, and at the same time not sufficiently invitational. We need to both get better alignment internally and strategize more openly and collaboratively to get past some of the false starts.

In February, Code for America commenced a 10-month co-creation process, which the organization describes as a human-centered design process to allow us to better understand the goals of the Brigade members, and find unprecedented solutions that are rooted in [brigades] actual needs. The purpose, governance, and model of the Brigade program are all under scrutiny. Through a survey, one-on-one interviews, small-group sessions, and several sometimes-tense webinars with Brigade captains, Code for America has been soliciting suggestions from Brigade leaders on how to build a sustainable, impactful model that fits the needs of both the brigades and the organization.
To CfAs credit, much of the process has been transparent and open: the organization has posted the webinars on YouTube and shared survey results and other relevant materials in a public document. This article draws on those materials, in addition to interviews with past and present Brigade organizers and CfA staff.
The initial call to arms
Code for America was founded in 2010 to help city governments better leverage the power of the web. Inspired by the Teach for America model, the organization began luring talented techies into devoting a year of their lives to fellowships with participating city government agencies. CfA fellows worked alone or in small teams to develop digital tools and solutions for local challenges, and in exchange, cities chipped in enough to support a portion of the fellows monthly stipends and other program costs.
After only a year, the number of technologists who wanted to help improve government far surpassed the number of cities partnering with CfA. In 2011 alone, more than 550 people applied to be a part of its 2012 cohort of 26 fellows. That same year, Google awarded the organization $1.5 million to expand the fellowship and build out two new programs, including the Brigade, a grassroots network of volunteer civic hackers. The Brigade program was created to give current and aspiring civic technologists a way to participate in CfAs mission in their own city or town, even if they werent one of the lucky few to land a fellowship.
Most brigades, following in the footsteps of pre-existing groups like Chicagos Chi Hack Night, adopted the hack night model, meeting once a week or once a month to work together on a wide range of projects, from building twitterbots that automatically share pet adoption notifications to public transit-tracking applications to websites that make city budgets more open and accessible.

There was a lot of momentum and excitement around what it could be but it was really a broad ask, Nicole Neditch, CfAs senior director of community engagement, told Civicist. All of the brigades look different from one another. They all have slightly different focuses and areas that they are working in.
CfA had its own organizational priorities for the Brigade program, too, including promoting network-wide events like the annual National Day of Civic Hacking, which started in 2013, and the CodeAcross weekend, which began in 2012 and coincides with International Open Data Day. At the end of 2014, Pahlka announced that the organization would begin prioritizing three focus areashealthy communities, safety and justice, and economic developmentin order to concentrate its resources and deepen its impact. CfA has encouraged brigades to work in these areas as well.
While CfA tries to figure out the future of the Brigade program, the organization as a whole has been simultaneously shifting towards an outcomes-based model. Were moving from a show-whats-possible framework to a doing-whats-necessary framework, Neditch explained during a webinar for Brigade organizers this June. More specifically, as Neditch and Pahlka jointly wrote in an open letter to the brigades published last week, their first attempt at real scale will be to take a streamlined online application for food assistance in California called GetCalFresh and spread it statewide, and then to other states with similarly low enrollment rates.

Since the Brigade program began, CfA has struggled to balance the priorities of individual brigades, which generally lie with their local communities, and those of the organization, which is invested in demonstrating a strong, united front around national events, focus areas, and signature tools like GetCalFresh, and the two sides have sometimes been at odds. Pahlka and other staff members frame these conflicts as primarily a problem of miscommunication, but the result has been lost trust and frustration within the Brigade network. Staff turnover at CfA, including the late 2015 departure of Catherine Bracy, CfAs longtime director of community organizing, followed by Hannah Young, the Brigade program manager, has aggravated the problem.
Reports from the frontline
At the beginning of the year, Brigade coordinator and researcher Monique Baena-Tan sent out a survey to Brigade leaders to kick off the co-creation process. She shared some of the responses during a webinar on March 31 that was later posted to YouTube.
One organizer wrote:
The loss of Bracy and Hannah, whom many of us had a strong relationship with, followed-up by emails from new leadership with a condescending tone and lack of respect for the work and dedication of our community has created a rift I hope youll understand is unacceptable.

Another said:
My feeling is that outside of the Brigade Team, CfA doesnt always treat its Brigade leadership as equal members of this civic tech movement the way they do with Fellows or other non-volunteers. It feels like perhaps the Brigades are perceived as a liability, or as a groups [sic] that needs wrangling.

When asked about this sentiment, Pahlka told Civicist, If folks feel wrangled, then thats a sign that theres been too much talking at and not enough sharing of inspiration and tools. Thats part of what this co-creation process is meant to address.
In general, there are certain brigades that are very sympathetic to the challenges and those [that are] more frustrated, Pahlka added. I appreciate and validate bothand its not binary, its a spectrumboth are totally valid and understandable.
I dont have much to add here, Catherine Bracy wrote in an email responding to Civicists request for comment. Except that when I reflect on my time at CfA, and when I see the results of the Purpose/Omidyar report, I feel even more strongly about the need to develop the skill of community organizing (and a deep understanding of how power works) inside the civic tech community.
Hannah Young could not be reached for comment.
Division within the ranks
Preston Rhea worked as the civic engagement program coordinator from March 2014 to June 2015, when the network was growing quickly and CfA was still flush with support. He helped come up with standards that would define official and unofficial brigades, a designation that was directly tied to whether or not brigades could receive financial support or in-kind donations from CfA.
Early on, I was involved in coming up with a sort of pathway for brigades, because you know Code for America wouldnt want just anyone calling themselves a brigade, Rhea told Civicist. This pathway came to include the development of a leadership team and a strategic plan, among other requirements.
Many brigades never bothered to become official, either because they lacked the capacity to do so or because they didnt see that the time and effort needed would be worthwhile.
Britten Kuckelman, who became a co-captain of Open Wichita earlier this year, didnt even know whether her brigade was official or not when she spoke to Civicist. In a follow up email she wrote, I had a conversation with my co-captains yesterday and we are not an official brigade. The reason behind that is we just never prioritized it and have been so focused on local we havent made a point to try to become one.
Derek Eder of Chi Hack Night told Civicist that his group has never become an official brigade because their work predated CfA and he wanted to maintain the groups independence, although at one point CfA did sponsor them.
Rhea told Civicist that creating standards for official brigades sometimes went against his instincts as a community organizer, and that he can understand the frustration of Brigade leaders. Inevitably, he said, especially because theres a lot of people who started brigades on their own and had a lot of ties in their community and set them up themselvesits going to be frustrating when you see a certain path forward that you want to pursue and for one reason or another you get caught up with stuff you have to deal with from HQ.
Captains who did choose to make their brigades official found that financial support from CfA did not come without strings, and was used as a kind of soft power over the brigades.
The brigades cant tell Code for America what to do...and Code for America also cant necessarily tell Brigade what to do, but Code for America does have the ability to withhold funding and support, said Rhea.
A 2013 email from former Brigade coordinators Kevin Curry and Hannah Young makes this connection between funding and CfA priorities explicit. They wrote:
Please keep in mind: Support is available only for activities that are clearly aligned with Brigade. Your project and expense plans will be used in determination of funding support. Priority is given to reimburse activities and events that we have asked for from you. Brigade will also reimburse your approved project ideas as funding is available for project plans [that] demonstrate strong alignment with Brigade goals and strategic outcomes.

Last year Code for America had to stop reimbursing brigades for event costs, in some ways making this issue redundant, but also putting many brigades in a tight spot. Brigades without local funding could apply to CfA for transition funds to cover the first quarter of the year, and CfA distributed $500 to all 14 brigades that applied.
Nicole Neditch told Civicist that the standards for official brigades were once necessary because of the way nonprofits have to account for funds, but said that they might not have to make brigades jump through those hoops now that the stipends have been discontinued.
Tait Wayland, the captain of Code for Birmingham, says he sees both sides of the issue. On one hand, he can appreciate the importance of compelling brigades to have things like a code of conductwhich all brigades, official or unofficial, must havebut he also agrees that Code for America used the stipends to control what brigades worked on.
As far as what projects we should work on and focus on, I think theyit seems like their idea of that has evolved over the past couple years a lot, to tell you the truth, Wayland told Civicist. At first it seemed too controlled, like the constraints that they wanted brigades to focus on. But then, you know, with funding not coming in it seems like theyve sort of backed off on what they wanted us to work on.
I dont really know currently what the rules are as far as what projects we should focus on anymore and whether or not thats constrained to any funding that may be coming in the future, he added.
Wayland told Civicist that the loss of the stipends hit Code for Birmingham pretty hard, and that brigade activities have been more dormant this year. Losing funding was the biggest factor to things kind of unwinding, he told Civicist. Wayland is currently training a new captain, and plans to step back from leading the brigade soon.
Complaints about pressure to work on specific things cropped up in the responses to Baena-Tans survey. One organizer wrote:
The Brigade program does a few things really well that are critical to the success of the civic tech movement: working local, building talent, and sharing ideas. CfA needs to lean into the things the program does well, and stop trying to make it fit a different narrative in areas that it is weak, like conforming to Focus Areas which may or may not be relevant locally.

Although some brigade captains might not have liked how the stipends were distributed, many brigades relied on them, and the sudden loss of a reliable source of support has in itself been a source of discord.
Forging ahead
The ten-month co-creation process began in February with a three-month research period, anchored by two webinars on March 31 and April 26. It was followed by an ideation period that began in May and will run through the end of summer, during which CfA is hosting small group sessions on specific topics like funding and governance models. The organization will begin implementing changes in the fall.
Chris Whitaker, the current Brigade program manager, described it during the March 31 webinar as unprecedented in its scope, but it is not the first time CfA has tried to rejigger the Brigade program. Last year, the organization hired consultants to look into whether an affiliate model could be instituted for more mature brigades, but after months of conversations with Brigade organizers, the model was found to be impracticable. This dead-end frustrated some of the captains who spent hours exploring the option, and who now say they are hesitant or unwilling to participate in the co-design process.
I spend a lot of time engaging w. CfA last year, and less time building a local community. This year, Its going to be hard to convince me to spend a bunch of time on the phone again, when I could be continuing to fundraise locally [sic], wrote one organizer in the webinar chat.
Code for Phillys executive director Dawn McDougall said that participating in the research last year was detrimental to her brigade. The community wasnt getting what it needed, she told Civicist. She decided to sit the co-design process out and focus on her brigade this year.
By CfAs count, at least a hundred organizers have participated in the process at least once, but that is still only a fraction of the 520 Brigade leaders in the network.
Baena-Tan and Neditch say they are pleased with the way the co-design process is going so far.
I looked at the tension [during the first webinar] as being a really great thing because people were able to actually participate in a way that they hadnt been able to before, Neditch told Civicist.
At this point in the process, it is impossible to know how exactly the Brigade program will change in the months and years ahead. It seems likely that the differences between official and unofficial brigades will become less important, and that CfA will be more encouraging of brigades prerogative to work on local issues. However, without financial support, it is also likely some brigades will fade back into their local woodwork.
We really want to shift [the] model and create low-barrier ways to participate and create greater independence for people to pursue the things that are going to benefit their communities, Neditch said.
Although CfA staff tell Civicist that they have always wanted and encouraged brigades to work on local issues, in communications this year they have particularly stressed that point.
I really wanted to emphasize the fact that local issues are important and that you can work on your local issues, Baena-Tan explained during a training for new captains earlier this year. She added:
I think when weve communicated Code for Americas concentration within the Focus Areas I think people have beentheres been a little bit of miscommunication and theyve felt discouraged in thinking that they have to lead their Brigade to only be working in those four Focus Areas, and I just wanted to really emphasize that thats not the case.

Just because we are focusing on these [focus] areas and taking a couple of products to scale doesnt mean that you have to focus on these areas as well, and it certainly doesnt mean that building the field is no longer a priority at Code for America, Neditch and Pahlka wrote in their open letter to brigades last week. You can and should address local issues.
However, CfA will continue to be invested in greater organizational alignment between Brigade and headquarters. In her interview with Civicist, Pahlka spoke of the importance of telling a shared story. When we think about resources, be they funding or people or time or attention, resources go towards coherent narratives, she said. The need for a shared story is also one of the central recommendations in the Omidyar/Purpose report for how civic technologists can grow the movement.
Pahlka said some Brigade organizers share this desire. Certainly a lot of Brigade folks have wanted to be able to pursue the priorities in their own community, she told Civicist. And a lot of Brigade folks have wanted to do something together that adds up to something more than the sum of its parts.

Indeed, many of the organizers wrote in response to Baena-Tans survey that they wanted to be better connected to the network, and the majority of them also said they highly value the connection to CfA; 58 percent characterized the association as very important (a five or six on a scale of six). However, when asked How satisfied are you with your Brigades current engagement with Brigade HQ? only 27 percent responded that they were very satisfied. While this isnt a complete picture of the networks viewsof the 520 core team members invited to take the survey, only 35 respondedit does give some idea. (After the first webinar, some organizers asked Baena-Tan to reopen the survey to allow more people to respond, but only six additional surveys were submitted and Zoe Blumenfeld, CfAs marketing manager, said that the additional responses had little effect on the original data.)

There is also no getting around the fact that the majority of Brigade organizers (63 percent) said they needed more financial supportwhich is precisely what CfA says they are not in a position to offer.
Sustainability of what are essentially volunteer-run local programs is an elusive goal. Earlier this year, Civicist interviewed the co-founders of OpenOakland, Eddie Tejeda and Steven Spiker, after they announced that they were stepping down as captains because they were burned out. They told Civicist that they had tried and failed to find appropriate funding to support their work on OpenOakland, which had eaten into the time they had for their jobs and their family for too long.
Code for Birminghams Tait Wayland also spoke candidly about burnout with Civicist, and the impossibility of perpetually running a brigade and working full-time, especially in a small city where city government is uncooperative and there might not be a ready supply of community members willing to share or take on a leadership role.
Even if we had all the funding and support in the world Id probably still be doing it, he said, of his decision to soon step down.
One thing that doesnt make it into the headlines is how much sacrifice goes into this work, Code for Phillys Dawn McDougall said.
Both are understanding of the challenges on CfAs end, too. I cant hold anything against them, Wayland said. I can complain but I cant really provide a solution.
What were realizing is that we cant rely on other organizations, McDougall said. Code for Philly is still exploring options for becoming more of a stand-alone organization. Of the groups relationship with CfA, she said, Id love to keep just having some way to keep supporting one another without it being harmful to either side.
When asked if she could point to any model brigades that have achieved sustainability, Pahlka said, All of them are sustaining. Not perfectly, but like I said, weve hit some hard times.
Where you see burn out, she added, that feels like, ok this is a sign where weve got to change something. It hasnt been burn out to the extent that anyone has packed up and gone home. They still believe in the mission and theyre still there...Weve just got to keep this talking up.
There is also the possibility that expectations for the Brigade and for Brigade leaders are simply too high. The way Tait Wayland sees it, nobody should be leading a brigade for more than two or three years, and the reality is that in smaller cities like Birmingham there might not be a ready replacement. Perhaps there shouldnt be the expectation or even hope that one or two superhuman captains will lead a brigade indefinitely.
Perhaps the expectation that all brigades can and should secure local funding is unreasonable as well. It is one thing to ask that of a brigade in a major city and innovation hub like New York or San Francisco, where experts in nonprofit funding and local resources are close at hand. Brigades like Code for Birmingham operate with fewer people, fewer resources, and, in some cases, greater resistance from local government. Although Wayland acknowledges that CfA has been good at getting fundraising materials and guides to organizers, he says brigades like his simply dont have the capacity to use them.
Preston Rhea also agrees that expecting brigades to find local funding is unreasonable. You cant just be like, people who volunteer their time: now you need to learn how to fundraise, he told Civicist. Direct support is a really powerful thing.
Building local fundraising capacity is also great, he added, but it needs more time.
I asked Pahlka if we should lower our expectations for what brigades can do without direct support from CfA headquarters.
I dont know, she replied. She said that when she began Code for America and started signing all of the thank you letters to funders, that there was a small stack of thank yous for significant sums. Now, she said, theres a pile of notes and many of them are for relatively small sums. Theres a notable source of change for me in the sources of the money. One of the things we theorized is we can arm folks with those tools. I didnt raise money either before I started CfA. I learned to ask for money.
When asked how CfA will continue to be more open, transparent, and participatory after the co-creation process is over, Pahka said, The community will have to hold [us] accountable to that and we will have to hold ourselves accountable to that.
We are going to figure this stuff out, she added at the very end of our interview. Theres so much good. Such good people. So much potential. Every time I get down about it, people tell me this is normal and that communities go through this. We just have to keep this positive spirit and everything will be ok.

Also in Backchannel, longtime tech journalist (and Civic Hall member) Dan Gillmor reports on Guifi.net, which he calls one of the worlds most important experiments in telecommunications. Guifi is a community network that has long since transcended its local roots. From a single node more than a decade ago, it has become a vast mesh-and-more system linking tens of thousands of people in hundreds of communities to each other and the global internet. He adds:
For people who want to see an internet at least partly liberated from the grip of rapacious, government-connected telecommunications giants, Guifi is one of the most hopeful developments to date. Its core values, ownership, and operations are testament to the idea that you and I, and our communities, can  and should  control how we communicate. For the tens of thousands of people using it, some at no charge, Guifi operates as well as Time Warner Cable does for New Yorkers (and maybe better).

The Revolution will be...continued? Now that Bernie Sanders has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President, he is planning to keep his political revolution going with a new organization called Our Revolution that will help recruit, train and fund progressive candidates, reports Nicole Gaudiano for the Burlington Press. Its going to be run by 27-year-old Shannon Jackson, who started out as Sanders driver in 2009.


And the winner is: With Hillary Clinton set to announce her Vice President nominee this Friday, I offer this prediction, using the Wikipedia edits bellwether method that accurately forecast Paul Ryan as the GOP VP candidate in 2012 and Sarah Palin in 2008. Based on the names currently being floated, and the number of edits to their Wikipedia page in the last week, Clinton is going to pick retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis. His page has been edited 18 times in the last seven days, compared to 14 times for Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, 12 edits on former Virginia governor Tim Kaines page, and just ten for Senator Elizabeth Warren and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. (If total edits since the beginning of June were the metric, the clear frontrunner for the VP pick would be Warren, whose page has been edited 173 times since then, far more than any of the other likely candidates.)

After all, it was in the proposed Executive Budget in April and stayed in there throughout negotiations with the Council that ended in June. And then it was voted on and adopted.
The fact that this amount of money made it through the budget process presumably mislabeled makes the case for Open Data even stronger, he continued. Open Data is not just about transparency. Our government officials are only human and our agencies have limited resources. Budgets are far too large and complex to be understood end-to-end by our legislators.

I will hold my nose and go into that voting booth, one reluctant Trump-voter-to-be told the New York Times, as Amy Chozick and Dalia Sussman report in a piece about the publics lost trust in Hillary Clinton as a result of the private email server fiasco. A New York Times/CBS News poll shows that Clinton has lost her lead over Donald Trump, and both now have the support of 40 percent of voters.


Our Micah Sifry writes for The Nation that, by remaining mostly silent on tech issues, Bernie Sanders lost an opportunity to push Hillary Clinton to have a more progressive tech agenda, and as a result, her platform is mostly a safe, conservative continuation of Obamas. Where Obama claims to balance support for individual privacy and security with ongoing reliance on Americas vast cyber-spying capabilities, Clinton mouths the same contradictory platitudes. If Obama has been quiet on the issue of protecting workers in the on-demand economy, Clinton is similarly vague in calling for a high-level working group.
But what of Sanders? Crickets. For all his socialist stylings, Sanders never articulated a vision of technology serving the public good, Sifry writes. Thus, for all the useful pressure his campaign put on Clinton to shift to the left, an opportunity to develop a more substantive progressive tech agenda in 2016 was squandered. Yes, a lot of idealistic coders built a lot of useful organizing technology to assist the Sanders campaign, but they had no influence on his tech policies. Nor, as best as I can tell, did they try to exert any.

Some black players have reportedly already been stopped by police while playing, and others have put together safety tips to use while playing the game.


Finally, Ben Berkowitz, the CEO of SeeClickFix, responds to everyone clammering to hear how he is going to use Pokemon Go to get people to report potholes, or complete other civic tasks.

The New York Times editorial board says the time to discuss killer robots is now, before another police department has the opportunity or need to use one.


Elmo Keep reports for Fusion that it was not the first time an armed robot had been deployed in a stand-off in police, citing a incident in Albuquerque in 2014, although in that case the suspect surrendered.


Fusion has also posted an interactive documentary about hunting down the people behind the mugshots.com, a site that posts mugshots and then forces people to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to get them taken down.


The rise of social media and the decline of the truth: Writing in The Guardian, Katharine Viner argues that the Brexit vote can be in part blamed on a media environment that no longer seems to care whether a story or a set of facts are true or not, citing Eli Parisers filter bubble and Civicist contributor Tom Steinbergs thoughts on Brexit and the echo chamber of social media. Familiar ground for many Civicist readers, but its always good to have a refresher course on the relationship between technology and media. (h/t Adam Bard)


Here is a list of all the things that have gone wrong (mostly injuries) while people play Pokemon Go, compiled by Fusions Ethan Chiel. Meanwhile, Twitter is split over whether Pokemon Go will keep people too busy to vote in November, or whether Nintendo could be pressured into putting Pokemon at polling places this November, thereby catching the millennial vote.


For her Poynter column, Melody Kramer lists the possibilities of Pokemon Go for journalists, which spills over into the civic arena as well. There also may be ways to augment this data collection with more information that might be potentially very helpful in the aggregate, Kramer writes. For instance, could Pokemon Go players track and report potholes in a city? Could they track air quality? Could an augmented reality program say: Youre in this spot where X thing happened. Would you like to do Y? Would you like to sign up for Z? (And then how might those actions be facilitated?) Or: Youve looked for X creature at 7 p.m. at City Hall. Did you know theres a City Council meeting taking place here tomorrow night?

Constructive
18F has faced resistance from the General Services Administration's Federal Acquisition Service from the beginning, Jason Shueh reports for Government Technology magazine. “I'm even willing to say on the record, as the former administrator of GSA, and the person who launched 18F, that there was, shall we say, constructive tension between FAS and 18F, entirely because 18F was being funded out of the FAS,” former GSA Administrator Dan Tangherlini told Shueh.

Robot future: The chairman of Tronc, the publishing company formerly known as Tribune, has said that they will be growing the number of videos produced each day from 200 or so to 2,000, John Herrman reports for the New York Times. Publishers like Tronc are increasingly using technology to assist or to automate the production of video, Herrman writes, because it's good for business. “The C.P.M. that we can earn with a video, or visualized content, is significantly higher than a page without it,” Tronc's chief technology officer explained in a video for employees earlier this year, referring to advertising rates on news articles. “Video is video,” he told the Times. “We’re producing it because it’s strategic and important…We’re also going to continue to augment with these tools. It could be that the augmented video is so efficient that it outpaces human-generated video.”

Now, about that "bomb robot" that the Dallas police used to kill a suspect in the shooting of five police officers last Thursday: writing for Vice, Jason Koebler considers the legal and ethical ramifications of such a move.

"Facebook has shown signs that it may still be trying to figure out how to handle the reach of its content," the New York Times' Mike Isaac and Sydney Ember write, reporting on steps Facebook is taking now that Facebook Live has been used to share sometimes violent and disturbing events.

Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan weighs in on the trend of the "reluctant news media" giants like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

Uber is facing allegations of fraud after the company hired an intelligence firm to look into the lawyer and plaintiffs behind a lawsuit filed against the company for violating anti-trust laws, Russell Brandom and Andrew Hawkins report for The Verge.

CPD co-chairs Frank Fahrenkopf and Michael McCurry discuss the presidential debate formats.
The Commission on Presidential Debates on Thursday announced the formats for the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate scheduled for this fall.
If you had hoped that this years debates would mark a bold new integration of technology that greatly enhances civic participation, youll be disappointed to learn that little has changed.
During an interview with CPD co-chairs Frank Fahrenkopf and Michael McCurry (above), NBCs Chuck Todd observed: The format looks almost exactly the same as four years ago. Am I wrong here?   The big difference, said McCurry, are the time segments during which the candidates can actually talk about the future of this country in a reasonable way. He was referring to the first and third presidential debates, which will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. According to the CPD: The moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Candidates will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. The vice presidential debate will follow a similar format, though it will be divided into nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each.
The topics will be selected by the moderators of each debatea single moderator will be chosen for each oneand announced at least one week before the debate.   The second presidential debate will be a town hall-style debate. An audience of undecided voters will get to ask half of the questions, and the moderator will ask the remaining questions, possibly drawing from topics discussed on Facebook and Twitter. The CPD has met with dozens of technology, academic and media organizations to discuss how to engage voters, particularly young people, and McCurry earlier hinted that social media would play a larger role in the presidential debates. But aside from College Debate 2016, an initiative aimed at first-time voters, and Join the Debates, designed to help teachers generate discussion in the classroom, there are no plans to either involve the public in crafting questions or to check in with social media during a debate for possible follow-up comments and viewer reactions.  Plus: To say Chuck Todd wasnt that impressed with the presidential primary debates would be an understatement. I think the quality of the debates this cycle has stunk, Todd said during a talk last month before the Seattle CityClub, a civic organization that recently launched the Washington State Debate Coalition.
Lets not pretend a lot of it was a lot of candidates, but part of it had too many news executives motivated by the eyeballs and whatever it took to get the candidates on stage, he added. The debate discussion starts around the 6:00-minute mark.
  
 Host Nationally, Teach Locally: One of the great achievements in American civic life is the fact that the public, the body politic, now has this expectation that the major candidates are going to come together and, in a civil way, talk about the issues, W. Taylor Reveley IV, president of Longwood University in Virginia, which is hosting the sole vice-presidential debate, tells the Wall Street Journal. The school is offering 31 pilot classes this fall related to the election in some way, including Thinking Strategically: Applied Game Theory, an Economics course, and Deception and Lying, Com 361.

STATE DEBATES  
Florida: The News-Journal in Daytona Beach is inviting questions from readers in advance of debates for candidates looking to represent the 6th Congressional District and county sheriff and county chair races.
Our goal is to ask substantive questions that give candidates an opportunity to truly distinguish themselves to the voters, said News-Journal Editor Pat Rice. The News-Journal will record the debates and post them online before the Aug. 30 primary. Stetson University and Daytona State College will co-sponsor the debates. Debates are also being scheduled in the 68th Congressional District, in the St. Petersburg area, where Ben Diamond and Eric Lynn are vying for the Democratic nomination to run against Republican JB Bensmihen for a seat being vacated by Democrat Dwight Dudley. The Pinellas League of Women Voters has been suggested as a host. And in the U.S. Senate race, three NPR affiliatesWUSF in Tampa, WMFE in Orlando and WLRN in Miamiare looking to hold debates for both the Democratic and Republican primary candidates. Two Bright House all-news stations, Bay News 9 in Tampa and News 13 in Orlando, are also interested. Back in April, one of the Senate candidates, Democrat Alan Grayson, took part in an open debate, sponsored by the Open Debate Coalition, with questions decided by the public. His opponent in that debate, Republican Rep. David Jolly, has since withdrawn from the Senate race to run for re-election in the 13th Congressional District. Jolly faces Mark Bircher in the GOP primary. The winner will meet up with former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running unopposed for the Democratic nomination, in a Sept. 19 debate sponsored by The Tampa Bay Times, 10NewsWTSP and St. Petersburg College.  Minnesota: The Winona chapter of the League of Women Voters announced it will no longer cancel scheduled debate forums if a candidate backs out, reports the Winona Daily News. Under the new policy, the candidate who shows up can give opening and closing statements and answer questions from the audience. It is unfair to voters for any one candidate or party to deprive voters of the opportunity to hear first-hand where candidates stand on issues important to them, said Stephanie Nutall, the Winona chapters president. This policy change respects the time and interests of voters and candidates in attendance.  Oregon: Gov. Kate Brown has agreed to take part in a debate with Republican challenger Bud Pierce in Bend on Sept. 24. The debate will be hosted by the Oregon Territory chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and focus on rural issues. It will be held before a live audience and distributed via media partners. Brown has drawn criticism from editorial boards and on social media for refusing to debate before Sept. 1 and for opting to skip a July debate sponsored by the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, reports the Statesman Journal.  Virginia: The Republican challenger in the 13th Congressional District, Marty Williams, has challenged U.S. Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott, a 12-term Democrat, to at least six debates. In an unusual move for an incumbent, Scott said six debates would be woefully inadequate in a district with eight diverse cities and counties. Eight is even better!!! Williams said in an email to Daily Press reporter Travis Fain.  Washington: Proving the demand for debates, the Washington State Debate Coalition announced it will hold gubernatorial and U.S. Senate debates in five cities this fall, reports the Courier-Herald. After receiving applications from 20 potential hosts, the Coalition selected more than a dozen universities, colleges, business organizations, civic groups and Microsoft. Debate hosts will be assigned specific dates and races later this summer. All Washingtonians should have an opportunity to participate in civic discussions and have access to candidates seeking some of the highest offices in our state, says Diane Douglas, executive director of Seattle CityClub, the founder of the Coalition.

We need intermediaries that can move from delivering facts to exposing and amplifying patterns; and leverage those patterns to move from information to intelligence.

During election season, there are a lot of partisan politics but little discussion about how elections actually operate. In fact, elections in the United States are a highly decentralized process, with just under 8,000 election authorities and around 22,000 election administrators. The technology used in these offices often varies, even within counties and there are varying degrees of digital literacy and training for administrators. Additional complications include different early-voting laws, absentee ballots for those overseas and military, and a lot of data, which can differ across localities. Some election officials are appointed, others are elected. From registration and notifications to websites, electronic ballots, and data management there are multiple areas for technology to improve the elections process.
In short, the election process is diffuse and lacks uniform standards. Yet every detail of elections, from social media outreach and ballot layout to data input and ballot counting, are critical components for the health of our democracy.
The Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL) is working to change this by building out a suite of tools to empower election officials. Critically, instead of simply building a top-down set of tools, CTCL has led an entirely community-driven process working with the Center for Civic Design to ensure that individual election officials have the resources they each need. I had a chance to catch up with founder and executive director Tiana Epps-Johnson shortly after CTCL launched their new toolkit for election administrators.
HRG: How did you come up with the idea for CTCL and the importance of building technology for this group of stakeholders?
TEJ: Local election officials are where the rubber meets the road in our electoral process.
But there are so few resources focused on helping officials keep pace with technology and improve communication with voters. We founded the Center for Technology and Civic Life because we saw work with local officials as one of the greatest opportunities for modernizing our voting process.
I was fortunate enough to see the community-driven, bottom-up approach last December in Chicago.  I was very struck by the design thinking principles, which worked to ensure that all people felt comfortable and able to express themselves. There were even fantastic animal stamps to articulate preferences! Can you tell us more about this process and why a community driven process is so critical?
We wanted to build a resource that both helped election officials better engage voters and was easy to use by election officials. The only way that we felt we could successfully do that was to have election officials as an active partner in the design process.
There were several points of engagement with election officials in the process:

We collected over 50 recommendations for tools in the Toolkit from election officials, both in-person and at election administration conferences. Officials could submit either tools that they had successfully used in their jurisdictions that they thought other election officials could use, or submit tools they wished they had.
We then held the December workshop (that you attended!) where we brought together 19 election officials from across the country, representing small, medium, and large jurisdictions. This workshop, led by our amazing project partners Center for Civic Design, was focused on generating additional ideas for tools in the Toolkit and narrowing in on about a dozen of the most useful (as defined by the officials) to include in the Toolkit launch.
In February of this year we held a second workshop, again led by our project partners Center for Civic Design and Drew Davies of Oxide Design, where a smaller group of officials helped to design the site itself.
Finally we spent February through our June launch doing usability testing with dozens of officials. This included testing of the way the site functioned as well as the step-by-step instructions included with each tool.

As you release this toolkit, can you explain what it is and what has been the biggest unexpected aspect of this work?
The Election Toolkit is an online library of tech resources, includes tools like a Twitter guide, a free app to measure voter wait times, tools for publishing real-time election results, and a collection of civic icons. All of the tools in the Toolkit are either free or low cost and come paired with step-by-step instructions, making them usable by any election official, regardless of their budget or technical ability.
As for the unexpected, weve being somewhat surprised by the positive response from people who plan to use the Toolkit who are not election officials. Weve heard from vendors, poll workers, and organizers who see value in the resources...and we think thats great. We are all aiming to increase access to important information about voting and civic engagement.
As we see an increasingly toxic political atmosphere this campaign season, how has this process left you all feeling?
For us, its been a clear reminder of the critical role that election officials play in our electoral system. They are the best source of nonpartisan voting information and are responsible for informing  everyone in their communities about upcoming elections. This is distinctly different than campaigns where there an incentive to only target those who are likely to support a given candidate.
We must support county, city, and municipal election officials across the country with the tools they need to effectively do their work in a changing tech landscape. And we see the Election Toolkit as a key piece of that work.

Writing in the New York Times opinion pages, Roxane Gay considers the challenge of videos that allows us to bear witness to horrific acts, like the recent death of Alton B. Sterling and so many others, but rarely results in justice. She points out the fact that the body cameras worn by the police officers dangled so who knows what they actually filmedbut also that film hasnt yet led to the sea change the Black Lives Matter movement has been demanding, and that it probably never will.


WNYC is partnering with AdaptNY and iSeeChange this summer on the Harlem Heat Project. According to a press release, the team will use heat and humidity sensors to capture indoor air conditions, and community-based citizen scientists will collect the data, as well as updates from residents via a mobile app. WNYC reporters will document and report on the project as it progresses. The goal is to better understand the heat island effect, where cities are often much hotter than surrounding areas, and to monitor and if necessary warn residents of dangerous temperature levels.

Civic tech of yore: Joshua Tauberer explains the history of Congressional open data, up to the present day, when he got the open data he asked forbut didnt necessarily want. Tauberer writes: If the first decade of the movement was characterized by internal angst over who benefits (Mike Gurstein long warned about unintended consequences), this next phase has been characterized by new inward facing questions: maybe not everything should be built by us and whether our movement has been welcoming to and empathetic toward issues facing women, minorities, the disabled, and other disempowered groups, and to people we disagree with politically.


Mark Headd read the Omidyar and Purpose report on the civic tech movement and agrees with the recommendations within the report, especially the one that calls upon city governments to engage with the local civic tech community.

Pardon the pun, but the times they are achanging at Change.org. The worlds largest petition platform is adding some new featuresbut the bigger news is what it is subtracting.
Buried in last weeks announcement that Change.org will debut a new set of crowdfunding tools is the fact that the organization is completely overhauling their revenue model. Over the next six months, Change.org will phase out their Sponsored Petitions advertising product.
This is a big deal. For the everyday user, Change.org is an open petition platform where anyone can launch a campaign for social change. But those user-generated petitions dont keep the lights on or pay for salaries or tech upgrades. For years, Sponsored Petitions have been the engine behind Change.orgs business model. User-generated petitions help attract new users, win inspirational victories, and build the companys brand. The free petition software has helped Change.org build a user base of over 150 million, and is responsible for tens of thousands of victories. And after those 150 million+ users have signed a couple petitions, they are shown a Sponsored Petition, created by an advocacy group or political campaign. When you sign that Sponsored Petition, your email address is added to the sponsoring organizations member-supporter prospecting list. Organizations pay Change.org for every email address they acquire in this manner. (I call this setup a reverse speakeasy or reverse mullet: theres a user-generated party in the front with a lead-generation business in the back.)
The Sponsored Petitions program has fueled Change.orgs explosive growth, taking it from a handful of staff in the United States to 150 staff around the world. And it is now going to be replaced by a 5 percent service fee on crowdfunding efforts through the site. That is a radical change in its business model. And we should expect three additional changes to quickly follow.
First, we should expect the new reliance on crowdfunding to drive a new focus on supporting sustained citizen campaign efforts throughout the site. Relying on Sponsored Petitions for the organizations bottom line fostered an incentive to promote lightweight, growthy petitions. Indeed, some of the most popular petitions on the site have been fan petitions, like the 2013 petition to Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane asking him to bring back the cartoon dog that had recently died in his show. Other popular petitions have channeled mass joy or outrage at the outcome of major sporting events. Those petitions are great for getting new people to sign up on the site. But they arent particularly well-suited to ongoing campaign efforts. And they can often crowd out more expressly political petition-based campaigns on the site.
Only the smallest victories tend to be achieved on the basis of a single petition. Most of Change.orgs larger victories have required a series of sustained, creative tactics over a period of months or years. Those larger victories tend to stretch far beyond simple petitions, and Change.org staff take great pride in the larger campaigns theyve helped support.
Replacing Sponsored Petitions with crowdfunding completely alters the incentives for what types of petition Change.org will encourage and promote. Single-shot petitions work well with the Sponsored Petitions revenue model. (Petition volume  Larger User Base  More lead generation prospects for partner organizations.) But youre only going to see significant crowdfunding from those users that are thinking like long-term campaigners. Change.org is now going to start nudging users towards bigger petitions (and issues) that require ongoing collaboration and effort. Change.orgs new bottom line is premised on it becoming indispensable to burgeoning social movements. If all goes well, this is going to be a transformative moment for the company.
Second, this is going to change the companys relationship with the rest of the nonprofit advocacy landscape. I asked Shayna Englin, Change.orgs managing director in North America, whether nonprofits would still be able to use Change.org for list-building. She acknowledged that this represents a move away from lead generation as the mechanism for engaging with our organizational partners because we dont think it currently serves our clients or our users as well as it used to. She also noted that Organizations can [still] create petitions on Change.org, and collect email addresses from signers who opt-in to learn more from them (for free). [...] Organizations can [also] promote campaigns via the Promoted Petitions tool, which allows anyone to increase exposure of an advocacy campaign.
So there will still be some options out there for nonprofits that want to use Change.org for building a supporter base. But those options just became much less central to the Change.org experience. I imagine there are plenty of membership recruitment departments at large NGOs who are now hastily arranging an emergency planning session to figure out how to fill the void that will be left by this shift. Make no mistake: lead generation isnt glamorous work, and it never appears in the public narrative of successful movements for social change. But large-scale, long-term power-building requires resources. Those resources either come from a few mega-donors/foundations or they come from a massive small donor base. If youd like the priorities of movement organizations not to be dictated by the mega-rich, then lead generation is an important function. The Sponsored Petitions program has quietly helped hundreds of nonprofits to build their small donor base. What will fill that gap?
Third and finally, a radical change like this is also a very big risk. Will crowdfunding service fees really be able to replace all the revenue that Sponsored Petitions were reliably generating? Will Change.org be able to displace existing Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.com?
I asked Englin why the organization decided to sunset the sponsored petitions program, instead of adding crowdfunding into the revenue mix. Her reply: In a word: focus. We are making a strategic decision to focus directly on the impact of our users, both organizations and individuals. [...] Once we add in what this focus will give us room to build, the platform will be an exceptionally powerful place for the ecosystem of change-makers to work together to build a better world.
The new focus certainly represents a commitment to supporting long-term, powerful movements. But I have to wonder if the company would have made such a major shift if the paid list-building approach were still reliably churning out a healthy revenue stream. Change.org is diving into uncharted waters here. Going forward, the company will have 150 million+ users, but no proven method for converting that user-base into quarterly earnings reports.
Big risks can result in big rewards, and Change.orgs new bet on crowdfunding and movement support is going to set the company on an exciting path. But this is uncharted terrain. It will take some time to see where they end up.

Tech and politics: Democratic almost-nominee Hillary Clinton is hoping to pull Silicon Valley leaders like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Tim Cook of Apple into her cabinet, should she win the White House, Patrick Healy reports for the New York Times.


Sasha Meinrath, the director of X-Lab, pens a critique for the Christian Science Monitor of Clintons recently-released tech agenda, writing that It glossed over critical topics such as the role of encryption for enhancing privacy and safety, and the critical need for greater transparency into how algorithms increasingly impact everyday lives.


Over the weekend, Republican almost-nominee Donald Trump tweeted an attack on Clinton using an anti-semitic image lifted from a racists account. Then he retracted it, claiming the Jewish star was a sheriffs star. Writes Jeet Heer for the New Republic, The pattern here is a familiar one with Trump: a racially charged provocation followed by a refusal to apologize on the grounds that it would mean caving in to political correctness.


Heres the online history of Trumps source for the tweet, courtesy of Mic.coms Anthony Smith.


The battle for civic tech: Two tech industry trade groups, the IT Alliance for Public Sector and the Software & Information Industry Association, are complaining to Congress that 18F, the GSAs internal digital service, is hindering their profits and unfairly competing with their member organizations, Jason Shueh reports for GovTech. Shueh drily notes that industry fears may stem from a shift taking place in government IT, one that emphasizes agility, results and cost effectiveness over established buying procedures  requirements traditional tech firms have invested heavily to meet.


Veteran tech entrepreneur Anil Dash (and longtime Civic Hall friend) went on a Twitter rant in response, urging his followers to contact Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) and express their support for 18F. Connolly led the skeptical questioning of 18Fs work at a recent House subcommittee hearing.

Last Tuesday, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor Kevin Johnson approved a $10 million innovation fund to grow the local tech and start-up scene. The fund will generate about $2 million annually, which will be used to support tech entrepreneurs, govtech initiatives, and the citys burgeoning innovation sector. The Innovation and Growth Fund is now easily the biggest in the country of its kindLos Angeless fund, in contrast, is only $1 million.
Abhi Nemani, Sacramentos 27-year-old interim chief innovation officer and the project lead, tells Civicist the fund has three main focus areas: the startup pipeline, the tech ecosystem, and government technology projects like streamlining city permitting and instituting open data standards. Whats most notable about Sacramentos approach, Nemani says, is the sustainability of the program.
The dollars coming into this fund stand currently at $10 million, but we expect at least $2 million in annual growth. That gives this city a special opportunity to build out its innovation efforts through a safe, protected, and guaranteed channel that would keep the Office and its operations intact. Thats a lasting modelfiscally and legallythat can sustain itself, he wrote in an email to Civicist.
Mayor Kevin Johnson created the fund in 2013 as a traditional economic development program drawing money from local property taxes. After it grew in 2014 from the sale of city-owned lands, Johnson renamed it The Innovation and Growth Fund in 2015.
Of the more than $2 million the fund will generate annually, $500,000 will be marked for the economic development department to lure technology companies to Sacramento, $425,000 will pay salaries and maintenance in the Office of Innovation, and approximately $125,000 will go to improving local governing practices through the purchase and development of new technologies to streamline Sacramentos business pursuits.
The Office is also planning a one-time investment of $1 to $3 million in venture capital funds in order to support Sacramento startups. By engaging the VC community we not only leverage our dollars against others, but also draw attention to the need for additional investment in this emerging market. Its the city playing a platform role, explained Nemani.
Nemani tells Civicist the fund is not just about internal optimization, but its actually more about external innovation: specifically how to support the the great startup community thats growing and thriving here. To encourage growth among Sacramento entrepreneurs, the Office of Innovation launched the 2016 grant-giving program called RAILS: Rapid Acceleration, Innovation, and Leadership in Sacramento.
With an allocated budget of up to $1.5 million, RAILS aims to support startup enablers, leadership (and technical) trainings, innovation spaces and events, and acceleration programs, Nemani writes. Thats a bit different than the way San Francisco and Philadelphia deal with the startup sector, which is through direct engagement of companies themselves.
RAILS will draw in civic tech startups through innovation grantsdesigned for groups making it easier to work with and in Sacramento or for local organizations bringing together the innovation community, according to the program webpage. Their site (which was designed by 18F) also highlights RAILSs focus on diversity, filling industry gaps, and catalytic ideas.
When asked how RAILS would prioritize diversity, Nemani responded, Governments can have norms when we make investments, and by specifically requiring a commitment to those principles we can help drive the kind of change we support. On the application, we specifically ask for real metrics that the programs can commit to around driving outcomes around diversity.
The Office of Innovation seeks applicants with existing projects and proof of funding or plans for developmentRAILS is not for entrepreneurs in very early stages. The grants are available for both nonprofits and for-profits, as long as their mission aligns with the programs goals and principles, says the website. This distinguishes the initiative from similar programs launched in Portland, Los Angeles, and Baltimore, which are only accessible by municipal employees or agenciesused to promote innovation within government rather than the private sector. I asked Nemani about the decision to open RAILS to the public and it was clear that maximizing the variety of applicants is a priority for him and the city. Anything to avoid a level of front-end bureaucracy thatd limit our backend ability to select the best ideas, he explained.
Sacramento opened the RAILS application portal on June 29 and may award funding as soon as August. All submissions will be reviewed by a panel of local business leaders and city personnel.
Its important to have successful entrepreneurs participate in the process to gain private sector insight, added Nemani. We should be investing in the expertise on the outside to create ongoing, sustainable capacity.

Instead of only responding to Hillary Clintons innovation agenda, Code for Americas Jen Pahlka assesses the current state of tech and innovation at the federal level, calling bullshit on federal leaders who think insufficient budgets are whats holding everything up. And the point is that if insufficient budget were the problem, then larger budgets would correlate with higher success. But the opposite is true, Pahlka writes. Bigger budgets for federal IT projects correlate with a particular approach: extensive requirements gathering followed by an enormously detailed RFP for a multi-year waterfall project handled by a traditional systems integrator. And this approach is highly correlated with both outright project failure and the kinds of software that no one likes using, neither public servants nor the public.

According to new court filings, authorities investigating the illegal lane closures in 2013 never searched a personal email account Christie shared with his wifeand from which he sent at least one Bridgegate-related work email.

Hillary Clintons full Initiative of Technology & Innovation is now up.


Karl Bode points out on TechDirt that the plan contains empty broadband promises, feel good statements about using tech to facilitate citizen engagement and government accountability, and barely-veiled hints that Clinton would continue the war-on-encryption.


The Washington Posts Brian Fung called the document a huge economic plan in disguise, that reads like a Silicon Valley wish list.


Public Knowledge commends Secretary Clinton for her commitment to net neutrality, support of broadband and 5G deployment, pledge to expand the Federal Communications Commissions Lifeline program to broadband, and balanced copyright approach. Public Knowledge also remains encouraged by Secretary Clintons support of spectrum sharing and a federally funded civic Internet-of-Things.


In case you didnt catch that, it seems like smart city technology is now the civic Internet of Things. From the Clinton factsheet:
Hillary will dedicate federal research funding to test-bedding, field trials, and other public-private endeavors to speed the deployment of next generation wireless networks and a civic Internet of Things. Governments around the world are already investing billions of dollars in developing and commercializing 5G technologies, and Hillary wants American companies to lead the world in wireless innovation. Her investments will aim at using advanced wireless and data innovation to drive social priorities in a range of areas, such as public safety, health care, environmental management, traffic congestion, and social welfare services.


The Innovation Alliance commends Secretary Clinton for her newly-released technology and innovation policy agenda, which recognizes the vital importance of patents to promoting U.S. innovation and economic growth, and creating high-skilled jobs. The agenda emphasizes the need to effectively protect intellectual property and notes that, since our countrys Founding, the United States patent system has been an envy of the world.


The Biotechnology Innovation Organization also responded favorably, stating, we welcome many of the broad proposals put forth in Secretary Clintons Tech & Innovation Agenda and we share her optimism in the power of American innovation and ingenuity to address global health, environmental and food-supply challenges. Furthermore, we look forward to reviewing more specific policy proposals to ensure the patent system continues to reward all innovators without favoring one industry over another.


The Free Press Action Funds Craig Aaron was somewhat more critical, stating, We urge the Clinton campaign to do more to recognize Americans serious concerns about unchecked spying and surveillance. Rejecting the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe means committing to change the PATRIOT Act policies that have targeted innocent people for unwarranted surveillance. Unfortunately, her initiative lacks details on how a future Clinton administration would protect the privacy rights of everyday people. Government and corporate surveillance chill speech and present grave privacy concerns for internet users. Dragnet surveillance programs and the targeted surveillance of communities of color present substantial threats to our civil liberties, and government attempts to create encryption backdoors leave everyone much less secure.

CPD co-chairs Frank Fahrenkopf and Michael McCurry discuss the presidential debate formats.
The Commission on Presidential Debates on Thursday announced the formats for the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate scheduled for this fall.
If you had hoped that this years debates would mark a bold new integration of technology that greatly enhances civic participation, youll be disappointed to learn that little has changed.
During an interview with CPD co-chairs Frank Fahrenkopf and Michael McCurry (above), NBCs Chuck Todd observed: The format looks almost exactly the same as four years ago. Am I wrong here?   The big difference, said McCurry, are the time segments during which the candidates can actually talk about the future of this country in a reasonable way. He was referring to the first and third presidential debates, which will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. According to the CPD: The moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Candidates will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. The vice presidential debate will follow a similar format, though it will be divided into nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each.
The topics will be selected by the moderators of each debatea single moderator will be chosen for each oneand announced at least one week before the debate.   The second presidential debate will be a town hall-style debate. An audience of undecided voters will get to ask half of the questions, and the moderator will ask the remaining questions, possibly drawing from topics discussed on Facebook and Twitter. The CPD has met with dozens of technology, academic and media organizations to discuss how to engage voters, particularly young people, and McCurry earlier hinted that social media would play a larger role in the presidential debates. But aside from College Debate 2016, an initiative aimed at first-time voters, and Join the Debates, designed to help teachers generate discussion in the classroom, there are no plans to either involve the public in crafting questions or to check in with social media during a debate for possible follow-up comments and viewer reactions.  Plus: To say Chuck Todd wasnt that impressed with the presidential primary debates would be an understatement. I think the quality of the debates this cycle has stunk, Todd said during a talk last month before the Seattle CityClub, a civic organization that recently launched the Washington State Debate Coalition.
Lets not pretend a lot of it was a lot of candidates, but part of it had too many news executives motivated by the eyeballs and whatever it took to get the candidates on stage, he added. The debate discussion starts around the 6:00-minute mark.
  
 Host Nationally, Teach Locally: One of the great achievements in American civic life is the fact that the public, the body politic, now has this expectation that the major candidates are going to come together and, in a civil way, talk about the issues, W. Taylor Reveley IV, president of Longwood University in Virginia, which is hosting the sole vice-presidential debate, tells the Wall Street Journal. The school is offering 31 pilot classes this fall related to the election in some way, including Thinking Strategically: Applied Game Theory, an Economics course, and Deception and Lying, Com 361.

STATE DEBATES  
Florida: The News-Journal in Daytona Beach is inviting questions from readers in advance of debates for candidates looking to represent the 6th Congressional District and county sheriff and county chair races.
Our goal is to ask substantive questions that give candidates an opportunity to truly distinguish themselves to the voters, said News-Journal Editor Pat Rice. The News-Journal will record the debates and post them online before the Aug. 30 primary. Stetson University and Daytona State College will co-sponsor the debates. Debates are also being scheduled in the 68th Congressional District, in the St. Petersburg area, where Ben Diamond and Eric Lynn are vying for the Democratic nomination to run against Republican JB Bensmihen for a seat being vacated by Democrat Dwight Dudley. The Pinellas League of Women Voters has been suggested as a host. And in the U.S. Senate race, three NPR affiliatesWUSF in Tampa, WMFE in Orlando and WLRN in Miamiare looking to hold debates for both the Democratic and Republican primary candidates. Two Bright House all-news stations, Bay News 9 in Tampa and News 13 in Orlando, are also interested. Back in April, one of the Senate candidates, Democrat Alan Grayson, took part in an open debate, sponsored by the Open Debate Coalition, with questions decided by the public. His opponent in that debate, Republican Rep. David Jolly, has since withdrawn from the Senate race to run for re-election in the 13th Congressional District. Jolly faces Mark Bircher in the GOP primary. The winner will meet up with former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running unopposed for the Democratic nomination, in a Sept. 19 debate sponsored by The Tampa Bay Times, 10NewsWTSP and St. Petersburg College.  Minnesota: The Winona chapter of the League of Women Voters announced it will no longer cancel scheduled debate forums if a candidate backs out, reports the Winona Daily News. Under the new policy, the candidate who shows up can give opening and closing statements and answer questions from the audience. It is unfair to voters for any one candidate or party to deprive voters of the opportunity to hear first-hand where candidates stand on issues important to them, said Stephanie Nutall, the Winona chapters president. This policy change respects the time and interests of voters and candidates in attendance.  Oregon: Gov. Kate Brown has agreed to take part in a debate with Republican challenger Bud Pierce in Bend on Sept. 24. The debate will be hosted by the Oregon Territory chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and focus on rural issues. It will be held before a live audience and distributed via media partners. Brown has drawn criticism from editorial boards and on social media for refusing to debate before Sept. 1 and for opting to skip a July debate sponsored by the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, reports the Statesman Journal.  Virginia: The Republican challenger in the 13th Congressional District, Marty Williams, has challenged U.S. Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott, a 12-term Democrat, to at least six debates. In an unusual move for an incumbent, Scott said six debates would be woefully inadequate in a district with eight diverse cities and counties. Eight is even better!!! Williams said in an email to Daily Press reporter Travis Fain.  Washington: Proving the demand for debates, the Washington State Debate Coalition announced it will hold gubernatorial and U.S. Senate debates in five cities this fall, reports the Courier-Herald. After receiving applications from 20 potential hosts, the Coalition selected more than a dozen universities, colleges, business organizations, civic groups and Microsoft. Debate hosts will be assigned specific dates and races later this summer. All Washingtonians should have an opportunity to participate in civic discussions and have access to candidates seeking some of the highest offices in our state, says Diane Douglas, executive director of Seattle CityClub, the founder of the Coalition.

During election season, there are a lot of partisan politics but little discussion about how elections actually operate. In fact, elections in the United States are a highly decentralized process, with just under 8,000 election authorities and around 22,000 election administrators. The technology used in these offices often varies, even within counties and there are varying degrees of digital literacy and training for administrators. Additional complications include different early-voting laws, absentee ballots for those overseas and military, and a lot of data, which can differ across localities. Some election officials are appointed, others are elected. From registration and notifications to websites, electronic ballots, and data management there are multiple areas for technology to improve the elections process.
In short, the election process is diffuse and lacks uniform standards. Yet every detail of elections, from social media outreach and ballot layout to data input and ballot counting, are critical components for the health of our democracy.
The Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL) is working to change this by building out a suite of tools to empower election officials. Critically, instead of simply building a top-down set of tools, CTCL has led an entirely community-driven process working with the Center for Civic Design to ensure that individual election officials have the resources they each need. I had a chance to catch up with founder and executive director Tiana Epps-Johnson shortly after CTCL launched their new toolkit for election administrators.
HRG: How did you come up with the idea for CTCL and the importance of building technology for this group of stakeholders?
TEJ: Local election officials are where the rubber meets the road in our electoral process.
But there are so few resources focused on helping officials keep pace with technology and improve communication with voters. We founded the Center for Technology and Civic Life because we saw work with local officials as one of the greatest opportunities for modernizing our voting process.
I was fortunate enough to see the community-driven, bottom-up approach last December in Chicago.  I was very struck by the design thinking principles, which worked to ensure that all people felt comfortable and able to express themselves. There were even fantastic animal stamps to articulate preferences! Can you tell us more about this process and why a community driven process is so critical?
We wanted to build a resource that both helped election officials better engage voters and was easy to use by election officials. The only way that we felt we could successfully do that was to have election officials as an active partner in the design process.
There were several points of engagement with election officials in the process:

We collected over 50 recommendations for tools in the Toolkit from election officials, both in-person and at election administration conferences. Officials could submit either tools that they had successfully used in their jurisdictions that they thought other election officials could use, or submit tools they wished they had.
We then held the December workshop (that you attended!) where we brought together 19 election officials from across the country, representing small, medium, and large jurisdictions. This workshop, led by our amazing project partners Center for Civic Design, was focused on generating additional ideas for tools in the Toolkit and narrowing in on about a dozen of the most useful (as defined by the officials) to include in the Toolkit launch.
In February of this year we held a second workshop, again led by our project partners Center for Civic Design and Drew Davies of Oxide Design, where a smaller group of officials helped to design the site itself.
Finally we spent February through our June launch doing usability testing with dozens of officials. This included testing of the way the site functioned as well as the step-by-step instructions included with each tool.

As you release this toolkit, can you explain what it is and what has been the biggest unexpected aspect of this work?
The Election Toolkit is an online library of tech resources, includes tools like a Twitter guide, a free app to measure voter wait times, tools for publishing real-time election results, and a collection of civic icons. All of the tools in the Toolkit are either free or low cost and come paired with step-by-step instructions, making them usable by any election official, regardless of their budget or technical ability.
As for the unexpected, weve being somewhat surprised by the positive response from people who plan to use the Toolkit who are not election officials. Weve heard from vendors, poll workers, and organizers who see value in the resources...and we think thats great. We are all aiming to increase access to important information about voting and civic engagement.
As we see an increasingly toxic political atmosphere this campaign season, how has this process left you all feeling?
For us, its been a clear reminder of the critical role that election officials play in our electoral system. They are the best source of nonpartisan voting information and are responsible for informing  everyone in their communities about upcoming elections. This is distinctly different than campaigns where there an incentive to only target those who are likely to support a given candidate.
We must support county, city, and municipal election officials across the country with the tools they need to effectively do their work in a changing tech landscape. And we see the Election Toolkit as a key piece of that work.

Writing in the New York Times opinion pages, Roxane Gay considers the challenge of videos that allows us to bear witness to horrific acts, like the recent death of Alton B. Sterling and so many others, but rarely results in justice. She points out the fact that the body cameras worn by the police officers dangled so who knows what they actually filmedbut also that film hasnt yet led to the sea change the Black Lives Matter movement has been demanding, and that it probably never will.


WNYC is partnering with AdaptNY and iSeeChange this summer on the Harlem Heat Project. According to a press release, the team will use heat and humidity sensors to capture indoor air conditions, and community-based citizen scientists will collect the data, as well as updates from residents via a mobile app. WNYC reporters will document and report on the project as it progresses. The goal is to better understand the heat island effect, where cities are often much hotter than surrounding areas, and to monitor and if necessary warn residents of dangerous temperature levels.


I wrote about iSeeChanges collaboration with NASA in January.


Civic tech of yore: Joshua Tauberer explains the history of Congressional open data, up to the present day, when he got the open data he asked forbut didnt necessarily want. Tauberer writes: If the first decade of the movement was characterized by internal angst over who benefits (Mike Gurstein long warned about unintended consequences), this next phase has been characterized by new inward facing questions: maybe not everything should be built by us and whether our movement has been welcoming to and empathetic toward issues facing women, minorities, the disabled, and other disempowered groups, and to people we disagree with politically.


Mark Headd read the Omidyar and Purpose report on the civic tech movement and agrees with the recommendations within the report, especially the one that calls upon city governments to engage with the local civic tech community. Building on his work in city government, Headd is writing a guidebook for local government officials that he plans to release under a Creative Commons license.


At the U.S. Conference of Mayors, five startups presented their civic tech business to 200 mayors and a panel of four judges (also mayors), and the winner was PayIt, a mobile and web application that streamlines transactions with government for services like utilities, taxes, citations, etc, beating out startups NextRequest, OpenCities, Citibot, and PlanIT Impact.


Tech and politics: A hacker has leaked documents regarding the Democratic National Committees strategy for countering and attacking the Republican National Convention, as well as a donor spreadsheet with 17,000 names, contact info, event names and dollar figures. Mark Hensch and Joe Uchill report for The Hill. The hacker, going by the name Guccifer 2.0, claims to be the same person who recently leaked the DNCs opposition file on Trump, although experts question whether it really is just one person. Among the possible DNC gimmicks listed is a Trump Against Humanity card game, pending the approval of the Cards Against Humanity makers.


New York Citys chief technology officer, Minerva Tantoco, posted a mid-year update from the Mayors Office of Tech and Innovation on Medium.

Pardon the pun, but the times they are achanging at Change.org. The worlds largest petition platform is adding some new featuresbut the bigger news is what it is subtracting.
Buried in last weeks announcement that Change.org will debut a new set of crowdfunding tools is the fact that the organization is completely overhauling their revenue model. Over the next six months, Change.org will phase out their Sponsored Petitions advertising product.
This is a big deal. For the everyday user, Change.org is an open petition platform where anyone can launch a campaign for social change. But those user-generated petitions dont keep the lights on or pay for salaries or tech upgrades. For years, Sponsored Petitions have been the engine behind Change.orgs business model. User-generated petitions help attract new users, win inspirational victories, and build the companys brand. The free petition software has helped Change.org build a user base of over 150 million, and is responsible for tens of thousands of victories. And after those 150 million+ users have signed a couple petitions, they are shown a Sponsored Petition, created by an advocacy group or political campaign. When you sign that Sponsored Petition, your email address is added to the sponsoring organizations member-supporter prospecting list. Organizations pay Change.org for every email address they acquire in this manner. (I call this setup a reverse speakeasy or reverse mullet: theres a user-generated party in the front with a lead-generation business in the back.)
The Sponsored Petitions program has fueled Change.orgs explosive growth, taking it from a handful of staff in the United States to 150 staff around the world. And it is now going to be replaced by a 5 percent service fee on crowdfunding efforts through the site. That is a radical change in its business model. And we should expect three additional changes to quickly follow.
First, we should expect the new reliance on crowdfunding to drive a new focus on supporting sustained citizen campaign efforts throughout the site. Relying on Sponsored Petitions for the organizations bottom line fostered an incentive to promote lightweight, growthy petitions. Indeed, some of the most popular petitions on the site have been fan petitions, like the 2013 petition to Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane asking him to bring back the cartoon dog that had recently died in his show. Other popular petitions have channeled mass joy or outrage at the outcome of major sporting events. Those petitions are great for getting new people to sign up on the site. But they arent particularly well-suited to ongoing campaign efforts. And they can often crowd out more expressly political petition-based campaigns on the site.
Only the smallest victories tend to be achieved on the basis of a single petition. Most of Change.orgs larger victories have required a series of sustained, creative tactics over a period of months or years. Those larger victories tend to stretch far beyond simple petitions, and Change.org staff take great pride in the larger campaigns theyve helped support.
Replacing Sponsored Petitions with crowdfunding completely alters the incentives for what types of petition Change.org will encourage and promote. Single-shot petitions work well with the Sponsored Petitions revenue model. (Petition volume  Larger User Base  More lead generation prospects for partner organizations.) But youre only going to see significant crowdfunding from those users that are thinking like long-term campaigners. Change.org is now going to start nudging users towards bigger petitions (and issues) that require ongoing collaboration and effort. Change.orgs new bottom line is premised on it becoming indispensable to burgeoning social movements. If all goes well, this is going to be a transformative moment for the company.
Second, this is going to change the companys relationship with the rest of the nonprofit advocacy landscape. I asked Shayna Englin, Change.orgs managing director in North America, whether nonprofits would still be able to use Change.org for list-building. She acknowledged that this represents a move away from lead generation as the mechanism for engaging with our organizational partners because we dont think it currently serves our clients or our users as well as it used to. She also noted that Organizations can [still] create petitions on Change.org, and collect email addresses from signers who opt-in to learn more from them (for free). [...] Organizations can [also] promote campaigns via the Promoted Petitions tool, which allows anyone to increase exposure of an advocacy campaign.
So there will still be some options out there for nonprofits that want to use Change.org for building a supporter base. But those options just became much less central to the Change.org experience. I imagine there are plenty of membership recruitment departments at large NGOs who are now hastily arranging an emergency planning session to figure out how to fill the void that will be left by this shift. Make no mistake: lead generation isnt glamorous work, and it never appears in the public narrative of successful movements for social change. But large-scale, long-term power-building requires resources. Those resources either come from a few mega-donors/foundations or they come from a massive small donor base. If youd like the priorities of movement organizations not to be dictated by the mega-rich, then lead generation is an important function. The Sponsored Petitions program has quietly helped hundreds of nonprofits to build their small donor base. What will fill that gap?
Third and finally, a radical change like this is also a very big risk. Will crowdfunding service fees really be able to replace all the revenue that Sponsored Petitions were reliably generating? Will Change.org be able to displace existing Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe.com?
I asked Englin why the organization decided to sunset the sponsored petitions program, instead of adding crowdfunding into the revenue mix. Her reply: In a word: focus. We are making a strategic decision to focus directly on the impact of our users, both organizations and individuals. [...] Once we add in what this focus will give us room to build, the platform will be an exceptionally powerful place for the ecosystem of change-makers to work together to build a better world.
The new focus certainly represents a commitment to supporting long-term, powerful movements. But I have to wonder if the company would have made such a major shift if the paid list-building approach were still reliably churning out a healthy revenue stream. Change.org is diving into uncharted waters here. Going forward, the company will have 150 million+ users, but no proven method for converting that user-base into quarterly earnings reports.
Big risks can result in big rewards, and Change.orgs new bet on crowdfunding and movement support is going to set the company on an exciting path. But this is uncharted terrain. It will take some time to see where they end up.

Last Tuesday, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor Kevin Johnson approved a $10 million innovation fund to grow the local tech and start-up scene. The fund will generate about $2 million annually, which will be used to support tech entrepreneurs, govtech initiatives, and the citys burgeoning innovation sector. The Innovation and Growth Fund is now easily the biggest in the country of its kindLos Angeless fund, in contrast, is only $1 million.
Abhi Nemani, Sacramentos 27-year-old interim chief innovation officer and the project lead, tells Civicist the fund has three main focus areas: the startup pipeline, the tech ecosystem, and government technology projects like streamlining city permitting and instituting open data standards. Whats most notable about Sacramentos approach, Nemani says, is the sustainability of the program.
The dollars coming into this fund stand currently at $10 million, but we expect at least $2 million in annual growth. That gives this city a special opportunity to build out its innovation efforts through a safe, protected, and guaranteed channel that would keep the Office and its operations intact. Thats a lasting modelfiscally and legallythat can sustain itself, he wrote in an email to Civicist.
Mayor Kevin Johnson created the fund in 2013 as a traditional economic development program drawing money from local property taxes. After it grew in 2014 from the sale of city-owned lands, Johnson renamed it The Innovation and Growth Fund in 2015.
Of the more than $2 million the fund will generate annually, $500,000 will be marked for the economic development department to lure technology companies to Sacramento, $425,000 will pay salaries and maintenance in the Office of Innovation, and approximately $125,000 will go to improving local governing practices through the purchase and development of new technologies to streamline Sacramentos business pursuits.
The Office is also planning a one-time investment of $1 to $3 million in venture capital funds in order to support Sacramento startups. By engaging the VC community we not only leverage our dollars against others, but also draw attention to the need for additional investment in this emerging market. Its the city playing a platform role, explained Nemani.
Nemani tells Civicist the fund is not just about internal optimization, but its actually more about external innovation: specifically how to support the the great startup community thats growing and thriving here. To encourage growth among Sacramento entrepreneurs, the Office of Innovation launched the 2016 grant-giving program called RAILS: Rapid Acceleration, Innovation, and Leadership in Sacramento.
With an allocated budget of up to $1.5 million, RAILS aims to support startup enablers, leadership (and technical) trainings, innovation spaces and events, and acceleration programs, Nemani writes. Thats a bit different than the way San Francisco and Philadelphia deal with the startup sector, which is through direct engagement of companies themselves.
RAILS will draw in civic tech startups through innovation grantsdesigned for groups making it easier to work with and in Sacramento or for local organizations bringing together the innovation community, according to the program webpage. Their site (which was designed by 18F) also highlights RAILSs focus on diversity, filling industry gaps, and catalytic ideas.
When asked how RAILS would prioritize diversity, Nemani responded, Governments can have norms when we make investments, and by specifically requiring a commitment to those principles we can help drive the kind of change we support. On the application, we specifically ask for real metrics that the programs can commit to around driving outcomes around diversity.
The Office of Innovation seeks applicants with existing projects and proof of funding or plans for developmentRAILS is not for entrepreneurs in very early stages. The grants are available for both nonprofits and for-profits, as long as their mission aligns with the programs goals and principles, says the website. This distinguishes the initiative from similar programs launched in Portland, Los Angeles, and Baltimore, which are only accessible by municipal employees or agenciesused to promote innovation within government rather than the private sector. I asked Nemani about the decision to open RAILS to the public and it was clear that maximizing the variety of applicants is a priority for him and the city. Anything to avoid a level of front-end bureaucracy thatd limit our backend ability to select the best ideas, he explained.
Sacramento opened the RAILS application portal on June 29 and may award funding as soon as August. All submissions will be reviewed by a panel of local business leaders and city personnel.
Its important to have successful entrepreneurs participate in the process to gain private sector insight, added Nemani. We should be investing in the expertise on the outside to create ongoing, sustainable capacity.

Bigger budgets for federal IT projects correlate with a particular approach: extensive requirements gathering followed by an enormously detailed RFP for a multi-year waterfall project handled by a traditional systems integrator. And this approach is highly correlated with both outright project failure and the kinds of software that no one likes using, neither public servants nor the public.

Hillary Clintons full Initiative of Technology & Innovation is now up.


Karl Bode points out on TechDirt that the plan contains empty broadband promises, feel good statements about using tech to facilitate citizen engagement and government accountability, and barely-veiled hints that Clinton would continue the war-on-encryption.

Public Knowledge commends Secretary Clinton for her commitment to net neutrality, support of broadband and 5G deployment, pledge to expand the Federal Communications Commissions Lifeline program to broadband, and balanced copyright approach.

In case you didnt catch that, it seems like smart city technology is now the civic Internet of Things. From the Clinton factsheet:
Hillary will dedicate federal research funding to test-bedding, field trials, and other public-private endeavors to speed the deployment of next generation wireless networks and a civic Internet of Things. Governments around the world are already investing billions of dollars in developing and commercializing 5G technologies, and Hillary wants American companies to lead the world in wireless innovation. Her investments will aim at using advanced wireless and data innovation to drive social priorities in a range of areas, such as public safety, health care, environmental management, traffic congestion, and social welfare services.


The Innovation Alliance commends Secretary Clinton for her newly-released technology and innovation policy agenda, which recognizes the vital importance of patents to promoting U.S. innovation and economic growth, and creating high-skilled jobs. The agenda emphasizes the need to effectively protect intellectual property and notes that, since our countrys Founding, the United States patent system has been an envy of the world.


The Biotechnology Innovation Organization also responded favorably, stating, we welcome many of the broad proposals put forth in Secretary Clintons Tech & Innovation Agenda and we share her optimism in the power of American innovation and ingenuity to address global health, environmental and food-supply challenges. Furthermore, we look forward to reviewing more specific policy proposals to ensure the patent system continues to reward all innovators without favoring one industry over another.


The Free Press Action Funds Craig Aaron was somewhat more critical, stating, We urge the Clinton campaign to do more to recognize Americans serious concerns about unchecked spying and surveillance. Rejecting the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe means committing to change the PATRIOT Act policies that have targeted innocent people for unwarranted surveillance. Unfortunately, her initiative lacks details on how a future Clinton administration would protect the privacy rights of everyday people. Government and corporate surveillance chill speech and present grave privacy concerns for internet users. Dragnet surveillance programs and the targeted surveillance of communities of color present substantial threats to our civil liberties, and government attempts to create encryption backdoors leave everyone much less secure.

Tech and politics: Democratic presidential almost-nominee Hillary Clinton is about to release a technology and innovation agenda and Politicos Tony Romm has the scoop. Among its elements: strong support for net neutrality and expanded access to high-speed Internet access, a special commission to study whether law enforcement should get more access to encrypted communications, support for the continuation of the U.S. Digital Service, and a high-level working group to review how on-demand workers are treated. Basically, the Obama agenda, continued, it appears.

Republican presidential almost-nominee Donald Trump is rushing to build a data-driven campaign infrastructure after pooh-poohing its value, Kenneth Vogel and Darren Samuelsohn report for Politico. They report that his new efforts at online fundraising have been aided by the Prosper Group, which previously worked for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and that his campaigns top data officials met with the officials from the RNC and Cambridge Analytica, to discuss how the latter could help with micro-targeting. Some of Vogel and Samuelsohns sources say that there is internal disagreement about whether to hire the firm, which the Cruz campaign paid more than $6.7 million.


That report notwithstanding, Trumps claim that he raised $3.3 million last Tuesday and $3.4 million last Thursday from online appeals is a lie, online fundraising experts tell Tim Mak of The Daily Beast. Theres no way his first big email requests for money took in that much, in part because his campaign used a new domain, donaldjtrump.com, likely pushing most of messages into recipients spam folders. There was also no sign that the Trump campaign A/B tested his email appeal. As Kate Kaye reported last week for Advertising Age, as many as 60% of those emails went to spam.


Trumps new digital director is Brad Parscale, the co-founder of Giles-Parscale, a digital media and branding company based in San Antonio that has built websites for the Trump Organization for years.


The marketing firm eDataSource estimates that Trumps email list stood at just 1.1 million as of June 1st, compared to 9.4 million for Clinton and 5.3 million for Bernie Sanders.

Rices article offers a comprehensive round-up of Snowdens activities of late and heralds the beginning of an effort to press President Obama to give him clemency before leaving office.


Valley talk: Last week at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asked White House senior adviser how the Bay Areas tech scene compared to Washington. She said Silicon Valley is heaven. You actually get things done, reports Jessica Floum of the San Francisco Chronicle. Judging from this report in CNN Money, the Kalanick-Jarrett conversation was a love-fest. The old school version of the labor movement is one thats exclusive, Kalanick told Jarrett after she asked him how Uber ensured that its workers voices were heard. Only some people get the benefit of being in a particular union, and it excludes others from participating ... The Uber version of the labor movement is its inclusive, is that anybody can work.

In it he set out a problem: as the media we consume becomes more and more personalized to our tastes and desires, the less we are exposed to people and ideas that we disagree with. The net effect is a weakening of bonds that keep our societies tolerably bound together, and a lessening of our ability to come together around challenges that may require us to compromise with others with whom we dont see eye to eye. He named this the problem the filter bubble.
Elis book was published several years ago now, and many of you reading this will sigh at the thought of another retreading of the same issues. But we live in the era of both Brexit and Trump, and so the issue has recently taken on a visceral flavor that it perhaps lacked even six months ago.
A British Perspective
I live in the U.K., and in case youve been sleeping in a cave recently, 52 percent of my compatriots voted to leave the European Union last week.
For those of us who live on these islands, the last few months have been an intense media blitz, even by general elections standards. Throughout it all, though, the filter bubble was clearly in operation, and before the vote I had numerous conversations with people who expressed their own concerns about how little in the way of opposing views and arguments was making it through into their social media feeds.
The day after the result I decided to fire up Facebook to actively go hunting outside my social networks to see what the victorious leavers were saying: I guess I wanted to spectate on their celebrations, see what was making them excited. I then saw something that made me write the following:

Now, Im not exactly a big fish on social media, but this lone tweet has picked up 800,000 impressions so far. It has clearly resonated in a big way. Much of the feedback has been supportive, although some of it has been fairly critical of my search skills (to respond to that Ive put up a post about my use of search since its not really the key issue here).
As I meditated on the curious spread of this idea over the weekend, a thought crossed my mind: if research in the decade ahead shows more concretely that there is a connection between social media filter bubbles and political behavior (and it is still early days in this regard) then it could have enormous consequences for the long term reputations of the figureheads of the social media world. The filter bubble could, in fact, become of defining importance of the legacies of Silicon Valleys superstars.
Legacies
Generally I think tech leaders aspire to be thought of alongside people who developed and scaled up technologies that were unarguably brilliant things for humanity. They hope to be listed next to Edison (lightbulbs), Fleming (penicillin), Marconi (radio).
But theres always a danger in being involved in an epic business success. Theres a danger that instead of being next to Edison youll be remembered alongside Alfred Nobel (TNT) or Othmar Zeidler (DDT) or Thomas Midgley (CFC refrigerants) as a person who truly, honestly thought they were bringing truly great things to humanity, but whose legacy turned out to be unimaginably darker than they had hoped.
Now I dont know to what extent the filter bubble shifted the vote in the U.K.s recent referendumI hope that someone cleverer than me is allowed to do some real research with the data that would test that hypothesisbut I do see a world thats polarizing and tearing itself up on a hundred fronts. And yes, its easy to say that this is obviously all about changes to the economy, or one religious sect versus another, or land or water, and its also easy to say that its stupid to even suggest that social media companies have a big impact when such huge motivating factors are at stake.
But if you work for a social media company, or you own shares in one, you shouldnt use these obvious truths as an excuse to do nothing about the filter bubble. Because you cant do anything about those land disputes, or the water disputes or the economic dislocations, but you can do something about the filter bubble; it is within your power. You can trial and test methods for exposing people to uncomfortable information until you find approaches that dont make people want to leave your platforms in droves. You can share information about the state of the filter bubble problem frankly and openly with the global tech and research community so we can all try to develop solutions together. And yes, Im aware from conversations with people in social media companies that the engineering problems around the filter bubble are bitterly hard, I get that. But that has never scared you before, so why start now?
A house divided against itself cannot stand, said Abraham Lincoln. The people who run social media companies today have more power over the divisions in our national and international houses than almost anyone else alive. I hope they see that our fate, as well as their legacies, depend on taking action, now.
Endnote: You might find it strange that I dont marshall a lot of evidence here about the extent of the filter bubble, and whether or not it really is a problem. My reason for omitting this is that I believe that the staff in the big social media companies actually already know what the filter bubble is and isnt with far more accuracy than anyone outside possible can. The question is not do they know, the question is are they willing to act?

Two hours after the Brexit polls closed, there was a 250 percent increase in searches for what happens if we leave the EU, Mark Walton reports for Ars Technica. Too little too late, guys. People who have an inkling of what will happen perhaps began searching for getting an Irish passport, which recently spiked 100 percent.


The Chicago Reporter has built a database of the 655 police misconduct lawsuits against the Chicago PD that have paid out from 2012 to 2015, part of a massive project called Settling for Misconduct. Chicago Reporters Jonah Newman writes, The City of Chicago spent more than $210 million for police misconduct lawsuits from 2012 to 2015, according to a Chicago Reporter analysis. It spent almost $53 million more on outside attorneys to litigate the cases. The Police Department exceeded its annual budget for lawsuits by almost $50 million, on average, in each of those years. Yet, unlike some other major cities, Chicago doesnt analyze the lawsuits for trends, identify the officers most frequently sued, or determine ways to reduce both the cost of the cases and officer misconduct. So the Reporter did it for them, finding trends like Nearly half of the lawsuits claim that officers filed false reportsand sometimes committed perjury on the witness standto cover up their misconduct and Roughly 1 in 6 cases alleges that an incident is part of a pattern of misconduct, fortified by specific Police Department policies or the citys general failure to adequately investigate officer misconduct.

How not to tech: Ethan Zuckerman responds thoughtfully and at length to the cringe-worthy essay by Contently co-founder Shane Snow, How Soylent and Oculus Could Fix the Prison System or, the SoyOculus method. The whole thing is worth a read, but here are some choice excerpts:
In other words, when Snow focuses on making prison safer and cheaper, hes working on the wrong problem. Yes, prisons in the US could be safer and cheaper. But the larger problem is that the US incarcerates more people than any other nation on earth  with 5% of the worlds population, we are responsible for 25% of the worlds prisoners. Snow may see his ideas as radical and transformative, but theyre fundamentally conservative  he tinkers with the conditions of confinement without questioning whether incarceration is how our society should solve problems of crime and addiction. As a result, his solutions can only address a facet of the problem, not the deep structural issues that lead to the problem in the first place.
Perhaps isolation for years at a time, living vicariously through a VR headset while sipping an oat flour smoothie would be preferable to time in the prison yard, mess hall, workshop or classroom for Snow. But theres no indication that Snow has talked to any current or ex-offenders about their time in prison, and about the ways in which encounters with other prisoners led them to faith, to mentorship or to personal transformation. The people Shane imagines are so scary, so other, that he cant imagine interacting with them, learning from them, or anything but being violently assaulted by them. No wonder he doesnt bother to ask what aspects of prison life are most and least livable, which would benefit most from transformation.
It is unlikely that anyone is going to invite Shane Snow to redesign a major prison any time soon, so spending more than three thousand words urging you to reject his solution may be a waste of your time and mine. But the mistakes Shane makes are those that engineers make all the time when they turn their energy and creativity to solving pressing and persistent social problems. Looking closely at how Snows solutions fall short offers some hope for building better, fairer and saner solutions.

What sharing economy? Has the Uber-for-X model gone the way of the dodo, or is it just growing up? Sarah Kessler investigates for Fast Company.


Participating in the world of sharing services often entails more risks for women and minorities, Sirin Kale writes for Broadly. The life-blood of the sharing economy is the idea that the public space is a safe space, wherein individuals can open up their homes to strangers and reap the financial and cultural dividends, Kale writes. Airbnbs mission statement talks of returning us to a place where everyone can feel they belong. It also describes the house as just as space. But for women and marginalized groups the world over, houses are much more than spaces: They are retreats, sanctuaries from a world where public space remains dangerous, contested territory.


Author Tom Slee weighed in, telling Kale: Its not really fashionable to be in favour of bureaucracy and rules, but equal pay for equal work, minimum wage laws, employment standards that limit employers right to fire at will, and anti-discrimination laws were the results of years of struggle by feminists, unionists, and anti-racism groups...I dont think they should be thrown away just because a new app has a rating system.


Although Airbnb head Brian Chesky has pledged to eliminate racism from the room/apartment-sharing platform, users must agree to waive their right to sue as part of a class-action lawsuit before signing up for the service. This has long been the case, but the terms of service were updated in March to highlight that particular clause, Katie Benner reports for the New York Times. The clause shields the company from the strong outside pressure to change that class-action lawsuits can bring, and allows Airbnb to address the issue in their own time.


And in related news, it will soon be illegal in New York to even advertise an entire apartment on short-term rental sites like Airbnb, Miranda Katz reports for Gothamist.

L to R: Moderator Yvette Alberdingk-Thijm, and panelists / storytellers Abdi Iftin, Antonella Napolitano, Sarnata Reynolds, Lina Srivastava.

With more people on the move today than ever in our recorded history, the global refugee crisis is posing one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time.
According to the UNHCR, there are currently an estimated 65.3 million displaced persons around the worldthis represents 1 in 113 people in the world, the greatest number displaced since World War II, and includes refugees, asylum seekers, or internally displaced people. The daily rate across the globe of forced displacement is a staggering 24 people per minute, with the crisis affecting Europe, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Of these, 21.3 million people have been formally acknowledged and labeled as refugees, more than 50 percent are persons coming from Somalia, Afghanistan, and Syria, and more than 51 per cent are below the age of 18.
The reasons for displacement are various, and the types of people forced to leave their homes are many. But refugees are viewed as a monolithic block in the media, by policymakers, and unfortunately also by members of the tech community. Many peopleoften including policymakersexhibit luddite tendencies, when they interpret technology usage by refugees as a demonstration of their self-sufficiency, as opposed to reliance on a tool of lifesaving necessity. On the other hand, while part of the civic tech community has been engaging in discussions of how to help, the current thrust of technology responses approaches refugees only as victims. Technologists too often take refugees out of the equation by having the solutions be about them as opposed to developed with them. But you cant hack a solution if you dont have all stakeholders at the proverbial table, with refugee interests and contributions at the center of your efforts.
Twelve months from now, millions more people around the world will likely be refugees. Some will have found refuge or returned home, and all will continue to develop their own innovations to secure safe passage and livelihood for their families. In the same time frame, will members of the tech and media communities still be exploring ways and remain committed to support refugees, or will we have moved on? And what impact will we have had?
These were core questions explored at last weeks Personal Democracy Forum. On the second day of the conference, the panel At the End of Every Data Point is a Human Being: The If and When of Technology for the Global Refugee Crisis explored the role of appropriate technology based in co-design and community storytelling by displaced persons, migrants, and refugees.
We gathered international panelists with experience in varied and multiple aspects of the global crisis, discussed it from different regional perspectives, and contemplated a number of technology tools and solutions, including apps, devices, data, storytelling platforms, social platforms, infrastructure, and privacy / security.
Abdi Nor Iftin, a former refugee from Somalia and member of the nonprofit writing center The Telling Room, presented his first-person story of escaping what he described as being in the middle of militants on the land and pirates in the sea, and using text messages and Facebook posts as both a lifeline for security and a connection to his friends. Abdis talk demonstrated that technology plays a key role in the ability for displaced persons, migrants, and refugees to share their experiences and stories. It is an agent for connection and communication. As Abdi explained, technology (cell phone, internet) allowed me to speak on behalf for other Somalis.
Antonella Napolitano, the communications manager for the Italian Coalition for Civil Liberties (CILD) then presented OpenMigration.org, a platform for data analysis in service of legal protections, journalism, and policy advocacy in Southern Europe and the Balkans. Antonella described how data-driven advocacy and storytelling can help to dispel untrue and damaging misconceptions about displaced persons, and to shift narratives of mainstream media that frames the global refugee crisis in false contexts.
Sarnata Reynolds, an international human rights lawyer and member of consulting firm Strategy for Humanity, told the story of the stateless Rohingya population and how nearly 20,000 of them used cell phones during the 2015 crisis that found them fleeing persecution by sea. Sarnatas talk presented two takeaways. First, text messaging and GPS technology permit refugees to contact trusted friends and advocates to help them out of dire situations/allowing advocates to locate refugees (though this is a tenuous form of communication because these communities have little ability to recharge their phones) Second, Sarnata asked the audience to aid in developing an online registry that would allow the Rohingya to preserve their cultural identity to combat ethnic cleansing.
Finally, as founder of CIEL, a cultural innovation lab for social good, I discussed our projects in Central America, Mexico, and the U.S. (Who Is Dayani Cristal?) and in Turkey with Syrian and Turkish kids together (My City Istanbul). I focused on the use of narrative technologies and interactive, immersive media to capture and present refugees own stories and lived experience as crucial factors in co-designing solutions and engaging in effective advocacy; and further discussed the power of turning production tools directly over to refugees themselves, to engage in the social process of collaborative design and to advocate for themselves.
The primary takeaway from all the panelists was that civic technology can empower displaced persons, migrants, and refugees by involving them in the design and deployment of these tools. For civic technology efforts to be successful, they must take displaced persons into account when designing technology, providing tools, using community stories and disseminating information, and engaging in advocacy, and should remain in contact with people on-the-ground, living these situations.
The panel discussion in its entirety can be found here.

Writing for Civicist, An Xiao Mina looks at the role of video and livestreaming in grieving for the deaths and injuries in Orlando. It can be easy to ascribe these networked actions to the attention economy, a vain attempt to gain views and shares in the wake of tragedy in the news cycle. The fact that some of the videos received tens of thousands of views might be testament to this, Mina writes. But most received only a small handful of viewsthe spirit is in the sharing, not the view count; the gesture of outreach, not the uptick in stats. I am less worried about the social gains of people seeking affirmation in a time of vicarious trauma, retraumatization, and crisis; I am more worried about the easy availability of assault weapons, the erasure of LGBTQ identities except when politically convenient, and the filter bubbles that bias our understanding of what happened.

The most powerful thing about a candle isnt the lightits that a candle can light another candle. A candle is social. A candle is viral. A candle contains in itself enough fire to light a room and counter the nighttime sky.
The same could be said, perhaps, of music. Often, the songs that resonate most with us linger less because of one talented singer and more because we can sing along.
This past Sunday evening, some 10,000 people gathered in San Franciscos Castro district. We met in Harvey Milk Plaza, a place named for a gay male politician who was shot dead nearly 40 years ago. We lit candles to remember 49 queer people, many of them queer people of color, who had been killed earlier that Sunday morning during Latin Night. More than 50 others were injured, and hundreds more ran for their lives. Details of the shooters motives remain unclear.
As news of the deaths at Pulse nightclub in Orlando rippled across the internet, so did news of the vigils announced in their wake. One of the earliest of these was in San Franciscos historic Castro neighborhood, where the rainbow flag for gay pride has fluttered for decades. On Sunday, it hung at half mast, as people marched up Castro and Market streets to gather in grief and find solace in spontaneous community.
And when we raised our candles, some people, like me, raised our cameras. When we waved our flags, some people waved their selfie sticks. A scattering of smartphones glowed in the dwindling sunlight alongside the light of screens capturing and documenting the event.

Mobile phones have become central to our lives, even up to the moment of death. Tragically, for many at Pulse on Sunday morning, phones were a lifeline, and a way to say goodbye. A recent Washington Post article pointed out that many who diedor thought they mightsent farewell texts and snaps to their loved ones in those horrifying hours.
Mobile video, especially livestreaming, is increasingly common in richer parts of the world, made possible by better batteries, higher bandwidth connections, and the proliferation of smartphones. Active marketing efforts from companies developing these tools has helped increase their popularity. Video is a particularly appropriate form for sharing vigils like the one in San Francisco on Sunday. We can live-tweet a speech, but we cant live-tweet a song. We can photograph a candle, but we need video to show the candles waving in unison. 
The queer club has been a sanctuary for the queer community. It has been for generations, Rosa Maria Hernandez Juarez, a popular San Francisco deejay and SF Dyke March co-chair, said last Sunday, to cheers from the crowd. I livestreamed her talk on Periscope as hearts bubbled up and commentsboth supportive and homophobicfloated in.
I take very seriously, she continued, the task of organizing spaces for queerness, dykes, transmen, transwomen, genderfluid, nonconformity, and for freedom...we must come together as a community, we still must celebrate each other, we still must danceand here, the crowd cheered louder and louderand dance and dance and dance.
Music and dance have often been central to queer culture, especially for queer people of color, from Gay Mens Choruses to voguing to drag, and Caribbean music like reggaeton and bachata was featured that evening at Pulse. These art forms are social and participatory, the sort of creative actions that soothe psychic trauma by being both physical and communal. Scrolling through the Tweets for #myfirstgaybar, a Twitter hashtag trend that spun up in response to the tragedy, I found memories of rhythm, community, and karaoke.
Indeed, Pulse itself was intended to be a place for healing. Barbara Poma, Pulses co-founder, described the club as not just another gay club but a space for community events for people along the entire queer spectrum. Its name, which we might first assume referred only to the beat of the music, honored Pomas brother, who died of AIDS: the pulse is for his heartbeat. 
As the Nations Richard Kim wrote, Gay bars are therapy for people who cant afford therapy; temples for people who lost their religion, or whose religion lost them; vacations for people who cant go on vacation; homes for folk without families; sanctuaries against aggression. They take sound and fabric and flesh from the ordinary world, and under cover of darkness and the influence of alcohol or drugs, transform it all into something that scrapes up against utopia.
Writing for Colorlines, Miriam Zoila Perez noted the specificity of Latin Night at Pulse, and how Latin night has played a pivotal role for many: Only a few times a year do we claim enough space to unapologetically play our peoples music, dance to the rhythms of our childhoods, and be in a space where all of our identities are seen. Its hard not to think that what happened in Orlando could have happened to us. How our night of queer Latinx joy could have easily turned into a night of terror.

Why do we take and share video of our vigils? It can be easy to ascribe these networked actions to the attention economy, a vain attempt to gain views and shares in the wake of tragedy in the news cycle. The fact that some of the videos received tens of thousands of views might be testament to this. But most received only a small handful of viewsthe spirit is in the sharing, not the view count; the gesture of outreach, not the uptick in stats. I am less worried about the social gains of people seeking affirmation in a time of vicarious trauma, retraumatization, and crisis; I am more worried about the easy availability of assault weapons, the erasure of LGBTQ identities except when politically convenient, and the filter bubbles that bias our understanding of what happened.
A more generous interpretation of mobile video is needed, perhaps. I think we take and share video of these vigils for the same reason that we attend vigils at all: to show others we care, to gather with people as much in digital space as in physical space, to show friends and observers we were there. A number of people told me they wanted to be there but couldnt, whether due to geographic distance, the need for emotional space, or the fear of another attackmobile video gave them a space to attend and bear witness.
And for the viewer, there is something raw and powerful about mobile video that a television broadcast cant capture. A livestream is a community effort, and a string of livestreams helps create the sense of a networked vigil stretching through many parts of the world. The internet platforms we engage on may be contested, consumer-oriented spaces, but for now, these are the collective digital spaces most readily available to us.

Joined by hashtags like #prayfororlando and #orlandovigil, these livestreams also take the form of Instagram videos and Vine snippets posted directly from mobile phones. They come from places like Greensboro, NC, Oakland, CA, Orlando, FL, London, Seattle, and New York. They take the form of their localities, while referencing a common culture, like gay and transgender flags, and Holly Nears Singing for Our Lives.

St. Louis, Missouri: 

Nashville, Tennessee: 

The internet has been central to LGBTQ activism in recent years, with marriage equality memes and bathroom bill selfies furthering a dialogue online and off and arguably accelerating a tidal change in attitudes over the past decade. For years, the streets have been the place where we gather in collective grief in the face of national tragedies like those in Orlando, and the past few days have been no exception in that regard. With a networked life on the internet, the streets have often gotten bigger and more interconnected, and the songs are more widely sung.
Speaking at the most recent Personal Democracy Forum, Jason Mogus noted that social change is like a marathon, and digital advocacy often looks more like a sprint. Both are needed, of course. What has felt like rapid progress for the American LGBTQ community in recent years is but one stage in a decades-long marathon for equality. Keeping with this analogy, perhaps vigils are like the much-needed water break, where we recharge and gather our emotional strength. 
As I watched small flames pass through the crowd, candle to candle, and watched photos and videos shared online, smartphone to smartphone, I started to wonder what was next: will this be another shooting quickly forgotten, or is this a moment of activation for a community with a long history of activism? Last year, Pride felt like a victory lap in the face of marriage equality across the nation. This year, we are remindedtragically, painfullythat the community faces an ever-moving finish line.

Alicia Garza speaking at Personal Democracy Forum 2016.

Editors note: One of the highlights of Personal Democracy Forum 2016 was this keynote talk by Alicia Garza, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter. Her talk was titled, Whats Democracy Got to Do With It?  How Black Power Aims to Transform Democracy.

Today my talk will be focused on how Black power is transforming democracyand yet I am also a proud member of the domestic workers movement and currently serve as the Special Projects Director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, in addition to my role at the Black Lives Matter network. We in the domestic workers movement are thrilled to be back here at PDF. It was on this very stage last year that my colleague Palak Shah drew the first connections between domestic workers and gig workers. Since then, weve been building bridges between our social movement and tech companies and Im excited for you to hear from Anand Kulkarni later today from LeadGenius on how tech and labor can collaborate to build a movement for good work.
When I was in high school, I was required to take a civics class, where I learned about my responsibilities as a citizen of the United States. My civics class taught me about how our system of democracy works and where it came from. It taught me that citizenship was a privilege earned only by participation.
And yet, what civics didnt teach me was that my citizenship is conditional. This is the harsh reality for Black people in Americawe are expected to participate in democracy, without receiving the full benefits of citizenship.
Democracy is increasingly hard to define, especially in todays political context. Not everyone agrees on what democracy is but one thing we do know is that democracy has always excluded Black people.  
For our purposes today, we can talk about democracy as having four key characteristics.
First, democracy requires a political system for selecting and replacing the governance system through free and fair elections. Second, democracy requires the active participation of the people, as citizens in politics and in civic life. Third, democracy requires protection of the human rights of all citizens. Finally, democracy requires that the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.
But let us take a look at our democracy in its current state.
In 2005, Black people, many of them poor, waved white t-shirts on top of roofs in the Gulf Coast, waiting for relief that never cameeven today. Stuffed in stadiums, abandoned in jails, shot as we tried to cross bridges to find safety, we were called looters and rioters while white families were called finders and survivors.
This was also the year that Stanley Tookie Williams was executed in the prison where my mother was once a corrections officer.
In 2009, Oscar Grant was shot on a BART station platform just three blocks from my home on New Years Day.  His last words were You shot me, I got a daughter. Tatianna is now an eleven year old girl living with the legacy of her father who has now become an icon, murdered when she was just four years old.
In 2011, an innocent man named Troy Davis was put to death in Georgia.
In 2012, Jordan Davis was killed in Jacksonville, FL for playing his music too loud in a gas station. His killer, immediately afterwards, went home and ate pizza with his girlfriend. That same year, Cece McDonald was jailed for defending herself against a racist and transphobic attacker. Rekia Boyd was shot and killed that year by Chicago police.
In 2013, George Zimmerman was acquitted in the murder of Trayvon Martin. 2013 was also the year that nineteen year old Renesha McBride was shot in the eye on the porch of a mans house, after shed gone there to ask for help.
In August 2014, Michael Brown was murdered just steps from his mothers home in Ferguson, Missouri. Just two months later, twelve year old Tamir Rice was shot and killed by Cleveland police officers while playing alone in a park.
We have been living in an era where everything and nothing is about race. Where explanations of the events that I just described are often cast aside as the result of a few bad apples or the unfortunate consequence of what happens to people who dont try hard enough to succeed. We emerge from an era where talking about race and racial inequity has been deemed racist in and of itself. Even Rodney King, whose brutal beating by Los Angeles Police officers in 1992 was one of the first caught on videotape and broadcasted around the world, responded to the rage that many poor Black people felt by saying, Can we all get along? as if it was just as simple as people being nicer to each other. A cauldron has been bubbling under the surface for a very long time, occasionally expressing itself in instances of uprising but none as sustained as what we are experiencing today.
Indeed, the last ten years of post-racialism and the neoliberal assault on Black communities has prompted a beautiful upsurge in Black resistanceresistance which has resulted in a new political order.
It has also forced this country to question and to imagine what a real democracy can and should look like.
Each year, more than 1000 fatal shootings occur by on duty police officers.  Each year, less than 5 of those shootings, on average, result in a charge of murder or manslaughter against those officers. In the last few years, that number has tripled, and while it is still nowhere near close to enough, it would not be happening at all were it not for the organizing and disruptions of the last few years.
Were it not for the months of organizing and disruptive direct action in Oakland, Grants killer would not have been charged in his murder, nor would his killer have been convicted.
Were it not for the organizing efforts in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, Ted Wafer would not have been charged with shooting Renesha McBride in the face, and he would not have been convicted in her murder.
Were it not for the courage and tenacity of young people who occupied the state capitol in Florida for 31 days and 30 nights demanding an end to Stand Your Ground laws after George Zimmerman was acquitted, many of us would not have known that the laws designed to uproot structural racism have been under continuous assault by these types of laws that give vigilantes the power to be judge, jury and executioner.
Were it not for the community of Ferguson, Missouri who refused to go home and let the system work, Darren Wilson would still be patrolling that community, and the corrupt nature of policing and debtors prisons built off the backs of poor people there.
Were it not for the years of organizing in Chicago to fire the officer who killed Rekia Boyd, to expose the collusion between the Mayor and the Prosecutor, we wouldnt have seen the recent unseating of Anita Alvarez, complicit in the cover up of the shooting of Laquan MacDonald, shot 16 times in the back by Chicago police.
Were it not for the organizing that didnt get national attention, Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, who refused to bring charges against the officers who killed an unarmed twelve year old child playing alone in a park, would still have a job.
Black people, Black resistance and Black organizing has changed the landscape of what is politically possible. Whether or not you call it Black Lives Matter, whether or not you put a hashtag in front of it, whether or not you call it the Movement for Black Lives is somewhat irrelevant, because there was resistance before Black Lives Matter and there will be resistance after it.
What is most important is the acknowledgement that Black people today are determined to make the impossible possible, and that work cannot be credited to either major political party.
When we say no more business as usual it is an indicator that we aim to transform this democracy into something that supports all of us, not just some of us.
Black people have been at the center of the fight to force this country to live up to the values and ideals it espousesthe very values that underpin our version of democracy. From Nat Turners revolts to Sojourner Truths Aint I A Woman speech to white suffragettes to Fannie Lou Hamer being sick and tired of being sick and tired and calling for independent Black political power, Black resistance and Black organizing have consistently shaped the way that we understand and experience civic participation.
Black people have consistently been denied access to the rights and privileges of citizenship that so many of us take for grantedand that is why so many of us are no longer content with private meetings and negotiations that happen behind the scenes which leave out too many people whose lives depend on the ability to participate in the decisions that impact them. So many of us are no longer content with the same old tactics devoid of a larger strategy that stares transformation directly in the face.
What is possible in policy and politics has been facilitated in large part by Black organizing and Black resistance. It is a resistance that challenges the notion of going along to get along, a resistance that is in dynamic tension with the notion that only policy change will get us to where we are trying to go, and that calls us all to the mat to live the values that we espouse. It is a resistance that says that no, we are not happy with the lesser of two evils, we are not satisfied with the process as it stands. This generation of Black resistance says that we are not satisfied with the crumbs that may fall from the table of power, and we are not satisfied with merely sitting at the tables of power.
This generation of Black resistance, of Black organizing, says that we aim to completely transform the way that power is distributed, the way that power functions, and that we aim for a new kind of power that is in collaboration rather than competition.
Our generation of Black organizing and Black resistance says that we aim to exercise power with, rather than power over.
Our generation of Black organizing and Black resistance understands that to enact meaningful policy change, we must equally value the role that culture change plays. Said more simply, the battle to win hearts and minds does not happen at the policy tableit is the work that is necessary to ready the ground for new agreements about how we interact with one another.
The last few years has given us much to consider, particularly as it relates to the assumptions that we hold about how change happens, what type of change we seek, and what gets in the way of us obtaining the type of change we seek. To be clear, this movement is not just engaged in an external struggle, but also an internal one as it seeks to clarify what it stands for and what it stands against.  We too are navigating the tension between allowing a thousand flowers to bloom while at the same time distinguishing between what are flowers and what are in fact, weeds that threaten to consume the entire ecosystem.
From my perspective, there are three critical lessons that we have learned about how social change happens.
The first lesson is that organizing works, and we must remain clear that organizing and protest are not synonymous with one another. Protest is an important tactic that raises the stakesbut protest alone will not accomplish all that we seek. The hard work of building a base that is in ongoing dialogue with one another cannot and must not be underestimated. It is the work of building relationships across difference for the sake of our collective liberation. It is the work of placing sustained and escalating pressure upon those who refuse us access to the decisions that impact our lives. It is the work of aligning ourselves deliberately with others in motion to create a more coherent whole.
The work of organizing has been somewhat distorted in the age of social media.  Yet while it is possible to move thousands of people online to accomplish a task, it is not, unfortunately, what is sufficient or required for long term movement building.  Our online presence is not the totality of who we areit is the way that we want to project ourselves. And our careful curated projections are no match for the nuance and hard work that movement building requires.  A three dimensional organizing model is whats neededknowing that each of us exist at the intersections of many different experiences, and that it is those experiences that can help us unlock the potential of what a new world can and should look like.
At the same time, those of us who seek to upset the table of power cannot continue to assert that disruption is somehow destructive to the aims that we seek.
Frederick Douglass expressed this in a speech he delivered in 1857:

If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.
Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.

Disruption is the new world order. It is the way in which those denied power assert power. And in the context of a larger strategy for how to contend for power, disruption is an important way to surface new possibilities.
The final lesson here is one of foreshadowingit is the reminder that movements are not reserved solely for those of us on the left. For more than thirty years, many of us have been contending with a powerful movement that has left a lasting impression on every aspect of our society. That movement has worked diligently to unravel many of the gains that my ancestors, my family, and my community have fought so hard for. It is a movement that aims to rewrite the narrative of history in order to determine the future, a movement that has had incredible implications for the lives of many. That movement has offered us valuable lessons about what it means to maintain coalitions and alliances of groups of people who do not agree on how to get where were going, but certainly agree on where theyd like to end up. Theyve taught us valuable lessons about the kinds of power that are necessary to re-shape societythat narrative power, disruptive power, political power, economic power in coordination with one another matter.
And yet that same movement is facing its own disruption from within, much like the disruption that I am experiencing in the movement that I see myself a part of.  
I will be honest with you that I am terrified about the current and eventual impacts of that movement. It is a movement that seeks to deny some of us our fundamental humanity.
What we know today is that a new way of organizing, of connecting across difference, of articulating our values and what we stand for and what we absolutely will no longer stand for is imperative if we are to survive. This is no longer about ideology or worse yet, political parties. We know this because neither Democrats nor Republicans have been able to stop the tide of frustration and disillusionment and hatred that is washing across this country.
It is up to us to take seriously the task of moving differently. We can no longer afford to congratulate ourselves, especially those of us who self-identify as progressives, when there is a backlash against us and we are largely non responsive, or are responding in ways that are ineffective and dangerous. You cannot tell communities who experience the brunt of racist violence in this country to vote for the Democratic party, and you cannot tell us that the Republican party is the only party buoyed by racism. It is unfair, it is untrue, and it is disingenuous.
Todays Black power is transforming democracybut we cannot do it alone.  We need the best and the brightest thinkers, strategists, coders, surveillance experts, tech geeks and disruptors to utilize all of the tools we have available to us to build the world that we want to see.  A world where Black lives matter.  A world where all lives matter.  A world where we can finally say:
We dared to dream.
We dared to struggle.
And because we dared, we won.

On the second day of the Personal Democracy Forum, Jason Mogus announced the release of a study co-written by Tom Liacas on how progressive advocacy campaigns succeed. We looked for innovation and best practices everywhere, Liacas and Mogus write in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. We reached beyond our ideological home turf to study campaigns on all sides of the political spectrum; we looked at groups like the Tea Party and corporate campaigns by Uber and Airbnb. We also examined the work of very large and conservative organizations such as the NRA, AARP and US Chamber of Commerce. Among their recommendations is opening up a campaign to allow for more grassroots power and building support within overlapping movements.

Last Friday, Personal Democracy Forum attendees answered the question, What is the key to a successful modern democracy? in only two minutes.
(The key, in case you were wondering, is education and participation.)

The answer was handed down by a new platform called Remesh, after parsing and distilling 130 individual responses from a group of early-morning audience members at the conference Friday.
The final answer is supposed to be the best representation of those 130 responsesthe most popular and the most agreed uponand is arrived at after showing participants their peers responses side by side and asking which is better. More than 1,400 votes were placed.

Remesh is already being used by companies for market research and corporate communication. It enables conversation between an individual (like a product lead) and a group (of users, for example) by helping the group narrow down a plurality of ideas to one, as in the example above.
Andrew Konya, the founder and CEO of Remesh, who led the demonstration Friday morning, told Civicist that one can do much more with the platform than market research. Konya said possible use cases could include a senator using the platform to better understand the voting populace (or, even better, the general population); a movement organization like Black Lives Matter using it to understand who it is that supports them and why exactly; and political candidates using it in to better understand what the people want and campaign on that, rather than marketing a particular idea to voters.
If those scenarios sound crazy and out there, its because the origins of Remesh are crazy and out there. Konya told Civicist he initially envisioned the platform as part of the solution to conflict moderation and peace-buildingto ending or preventing wars, essentially. The way Remesh is currently set up, it enables individual to group conversationbut it could also be set up to enable group to group conversationgovernment to government; country to country.
Konya has tested the platform with a group as large as 2,000, and has already run a real conversation with more than 1,000 participants. He says they will soon run one with 50,000 participants.
Unlike other deliberative platforms, Remesh is always run in real-time. Konya says two minutes is the sweet spot for answering a questionlong enough to give people time to respond and to vote around 10 timesalthough for more involved questions that time can be extended to five minutes or longer.
Responses on Remesh can be filtered by demographics and other identifiers as well, to see whether those factors are the source of difference and division. At the conference Friday, participants were asked to self-identify their age range and political affiliationDemocrat, Republican, or Independentand their answers can be sorted according.

Perhaps because this is Personal Democracy Forum and attendees of this conference share many of the same ideals, regardless of political identity, but the top answer given by the (103) Democrats in the audience  Informed populations, transparent policy, accountable governance  was not all that different from the top two answers by the (six) Republicans  Engaged citizens and Participation and accountability  especially if you smushed those together. On stage, Konya said he found it heartening that there was more consensus than division in the responses.
I asked Konya what might be lost by using a system like thisthe opportunity for argument, debate, conversation, persuasionand if it is meant to supplement existing decision-making processes or to replace them.
Both, he replied. Dont trust technology to make a giant decisionstill leave a human in it.
But in time, tech can probably get better than humans, he said. Not at generating an answer, but at arriving at consensus. Its not that weve built an AI thats more intelligent; its the wisdom of the crowd thats intelligent. Remesh just helps bring that out.
I asked Konya what makes Remesh civicor for the public goodand he replied that it is in the public good for the public to be accurately understood, and I just think theyre not right now.
Tech doesnt solve anything, its the people using it who do. So the key is getting it into the hands of people who can leverage it for civic good.

The first day of Personal Democracy Forum 2016 got off to an emotional start yesterday with a remembrance of the late Jake Brewer, followed by a talk by Brewers wife, Mary Katherine Ham, who gave a version of a talk originally pitched by her husband, reimagining the founding fathers as startup entrepreneurs with this great idea for Uber but for countries. She also spoke with humor and feeling about grief, and what it means to be the steward of Jake Brewers divine spark, for their children and for the world.


The Tech We Need: Later in the morning, we saw the launch of Civic Halls new research and development nonprofit, Civic Hall Labs, which will collaborate with various partners to design and build civic tech, or tech for the public good. Elizabeth Stewart introduced the idea on stage, and Erin Simpson wrote about the launch for Civicist.


Fast Companys Marcus Baram covered the launch.


The Omidyar Network and Purpose released a study about what civic tech can learn from social movements to coincide with Stacy Donohues main stage talk yesterday morning, but Donohue also wrote an introduction to the study that is also posted on Civicist, and covers the five key takeaways from the study.


Although the Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan was unable to join us in person this year, we screened a short video about his experience returning to the internet after his six-year imprisonment for web activism, and finding that the best part of the internet had died. Both the video and an essay about the experience have been posted on Civicist.


Former Sanders campaigner Zack Exley spoke on the main stage and on an afternoon panel about distributed organizing, and I wrote about his remarks for Civicist.


Still to come: Kate Crawford, Alicia Garza, Anil Dash, Douglas Rushkoff, and more. Livestream the main stage talks here and follow along on Twitter with #PDF16.

First Post 







Just days after it became clear that Bernie Sanders will almost definitely not win the Democratic nomination, former senior advisor to the Sanders campaign Zack Exley appeared on the Personal Democracy Forum stage to share lessons learned over the past year, or how we can again unleash the power of the many.
His talk focused on the plight of Sarah, from Overland Park, Kansasa hardworking mother struggling to get by because shit is brokenand others like her. I want to be clear about what unleashed the power of many in this campaign, Exley said. Its that people are getting screwed. Twitter reactions ranged from appreciation for real talk instead of happy tools digital triumphalism and criticism for the self-congratulatory tone that made it sound like no one has ever been inspired or organized before.
His words fell on well-versed ears; most Personal Democracy Forum attendees are familiar with the many ways low income Americans are getting screwed, even if they are not intimately familiar with that experience. And there was no acknowledgement that similar fears and struggles are sending voters straight into the Donald Trump camp, or analysis as to what makes the fears of Sanders supporters differ from Trump supporters.
It wasnt until an afternoon panel on decentralized organizing that Exley drilled down to any specifics in terms of tools or strategies.
In response to moderator Allison Fines question, how do you build structure into a decentralized movement?, Exley replied, Really difficultly.
According to Exley, by the time he got involved in the Bernie Sanders campaign overseeing distributed organizing, the tyranny of the annoying, was already in full swing. The tyranny of the annoying, Exley explained, is the principle that in every group of 100 fantastic people there is always one person intent on destroying the organization: trying to lead when they shouldnt lead, intentionally undermining other organizers, or otherwise tearing the group down from within.
When Exley started working with the campaign, there were already a number of local groups on Facebook and Slackand already many of them were dealing with a problem child.
It wasnt the only problem in the campaign, Exley said. Im still shell-shocked by it. He paused. Maybe it was the only problem come to think of it.
The optimal size for a Slack organizing channel, Exley said, is about 30. Anything bigger than that and the channel starts to break down because there arent very many moderation tools (and because the larger a group gets the more likely it is that someone annoying will crash the party).
Exley argued that new tools dont replace old tools but are always expanding the realm of possibility. The horse was a new tool, he said. Thats how empires were created.
Railroads, he added, made America one unified organization. Whole new organizations grew out because of this new technology.
But new tools are coming faster and faster and theyre becoming harder to use and harder to tweak, he said. I can see if we just change a few of these features, it will allow us to do more at a higher level faster.
As a one-time computer programmer, Exley says its frustrating to recognize that and not to be able to do anything about it.
After the panel, I followed up with Exley for more specifics on what features hed like to see added to organizing tools. He said he would like more moderation options on Slack, and the ability to nominate or anoint a Slack channel leader.
Although many of his comments were in the past tense (as some noted on Twitter) Exley did not offer a campaign postmortem, nor did he speculate extensively about whats next, although he did plug the campaign Brand New Congress, which he helped start along with other former Sanders organizers.
Exley said the Brand New Congress campaign will seek to break many of the organizing structures that election campaigns that came before have been built onbeginning with compensation. Exley told Civicist after the panel that there will be no difference in terms of responsibility between paid and unpaid volunteers. When I asked why pay anyone, he said because they have some money, and because they want to win. When I asked how they would decide who got paid, he said he wasnt quite sure yet. He said the people I want to payhe is not part of the current leadership team of five and so is not in charge of these decisionswant to work full time and dont have any other way to participate without financial compensation.
So like need-based salaries? I asked.
Not salaries.
Need-based compensation, then?
No, more like need-based support.
And Exley reiterated his belief that the revolution will not be funded. The money, he said, needs to come from the peoplefrom the bottom not the top.

#PDF16Organizing 







There is a story in the Quran about a group of Christians who escaped persecution by taking refuge in a cave. There they fell into a very long sleep which they thought only lasted a day or two. But it actually had lasted for centuries. When they woke they were obviously very hungry. It was only when they went down to the city to buy some food that they realized how much time had passed. When they wanted to pay, nobody accepted their money.
This is what happened to me in 2014, when I was freed from a six-year-long imprisonment in Tehran, over my web activism.
I had been a pioneer in tech journalism and blogging in Iran, and for that reason they came to call me the blogfather. I had many readers, friends  and of course enemies.
After I was freed, I realized that the currency we all used in those days had become obsolete. Im talking about those blue underlined bits of text, where you could click and be transferred to another web page, to an unknown place, to another world. They were called hyperlinks.
I understood that most of the blogs I used to read were abandoned. The vibrant Persian blogosphere to which I had dedicated myself was a graveyard.
I started searching for bloggers and surprisingly enough, I found them all in a place called Facebook. In 2008, before I was arrested in Tehran, I thought of Facebook as a great place to keep in touch with new and old friends. To maintain a social network of the people I knew in person.
What happened during my absence was that Facebook had become a publishing platform as well as a social network. First, most readers of blogs moved to Facebook, and then authors had to follow.
Facebook is a closed publishing platform, something like a password-protected blog, which I always hated. It is also a very centralized and limiting one. You cant host it on your own domain name, and you cant change what it looks like.
But soon I discovered the main problem with Facebook is something deeper: it doesnt like hyperlinks.
Lets go back a little bit. The hyperlink was the foundation of Tim Berners-Lees invention, the world wide web. It was what made the web so incredibly diverse, open, non-linear, and decentralized. It was the biggest achievement of human civilization since the emergence of alphabets, writing, and the printing press.
Blogs best illustrated the potential of the hyperlink. In the era of blogging, we used to read and discuss all the time. We used to challenge each other, make arguments, provide evidence, investigate, discoverwe used to think quite a lot. And most of that would have been impossible without hyperlinks.
In those days, people who had many hyperlinks, either from or to her web page, were wealthy.
Now on Facebook, and increasingly on most social media, instead of links, we have likes. Instead of thinking, we have a reality show.
On Facebook, which to most people on the planet will soon mean the entire internet, links are treated as objects, not as relations. They are not supposed to enrich your textthey are themselves open to a popularity contest.
Links are less and less encouraged, because social networks make money only if you are inside of them. Instagram completely bans hyperlinks, and Facebook with its Instant Articles project has found a way to even further minimize links.
Meanwhile, smartphones pose a different threat. Web pages are filled with ads and scripts that slow down everything. So fewer people follow links on mobile web browsers, or open several tabs, because its just a hassle. And quality web-based media are losing more and more money, because people are using adblockers.
The result is that with the demise of links, the web is dying.
...
Now the internet is comprised of social media apps rather than websites, and these apps are not even connected.
But the new internet is also different in other ways. Its catching up quickly with the offline world and its dominant social values.
Lets look at algorithms that social network now use to show us what we need to know. What they pick is based on two things: how recent they are, and how many likes they have received. Basically they only show you what is new and popular.
These are two of the most dominant social values of our time: newness and popularity. Anything else is doomed to silence, to a quiet death. Isnt this like our societies obsession with young celebrities, and our increasing negligence of the elderly and minorities?
Facebooks news feed algorithms reinforce our views and opinions because they work according to our habits. But at the same time, they suppress minorities, because a minority opinion never gets enough likes to appear on peoples newsfeeds.
It also radicalizes them, not only by producing a sense of frustration that comes from imposed silence, but also by depriving them (like all of us) from being challenged.
Facebook, and other similar social networks, have put an end to the utopian vision we were all inspired by, a decade ago: a diverse, open, non-linear, and decentralized space that promoted dialogue and tolerance.
Now when we log on to Facebook and scroll down and see all those entertaining pictures and videos, there is nothing left of that utopian vision.
This is not the internet I knew before I went to jail. This linear, passive, centralized, and homogenous stream of still or moving images is nothing but television.
A personalized television, with many of its features.
It has a prime time, when more people are tuned in and can see the stream. It is heavily dependent on celebrities. It treats the most serious topics in a shallow, rushed, and emotional way. It is obsessed with soundbites and infographics. It is closed and self-referential.
The new internet is clearly not a place for thinking and debate, as it used to be. No wonder all those so-called Facebook and Twitter revolutions around the world collapsed. When algorithms replace charismatic leaders, they divide everyone, fragmenting their unity of will and vision, and leading them into fighting each other rather than pushing for their cause.
There is another aspect to this shift from library-internet to television-internet. We seem to be moving from a word-centered to an image-centered society. Look at what is happening to news outlets. They are rapidly losing readers, especially among the younger people. They are creating or expanding video departments while downsizing their newsrooms. Look at emojis and how theyre forming a universal pre-alphabetic language. Look at the shifts in our trends: from blogs, to Twitter, to Instagram. Less and less text, more and more video.
This is recreating the social formation of the old historical times, where a tiny elite of religious scholars and politicians were able to read, write, and think. This was how they controlled their largely illiterate people and justified their continued dominance.
Soon anyone who can read more than 140 characters (yes, Im exaggerating) will be considered as literate. The rest, hooked to their old or new tvs, will be amused to death, as Neil Postman said. This is already happening in the culture that invented television and is now dominated by it. Donald Trump was produced by the old and new television and is on his way to rule over the most TV-centered society in the world.
...
So where are the points of resistance in all this? How can we re-imagine a space that nurtures debate, diversity, and understanding?
One way out of this horrifying tunnel is to re-imagine new algorithms with new kinds of social values, such as diversity and quality. It is possible. If we have created algorithms that enforce our habits, we can also get them to challenge those habits. DJs do this all the time. Their selections are not based on whats new and whats popular. They play old tracks we all loved in the past, and they surprise us with great stuff we would never have listened to otherwise.
Maybe its time for states to intervene and push big social networks to open up their algorithms, and to allow third-party developers to create different kinds of algorithms as plugins.
The truth is that our habits are destroying us. The hyperlink was a powerful, brilliant idea and enabled us to leave our comfort zone. We must revive hyperlinks, to help save the world from growing conflicts. What we need now, more than ever, is not to be comforted. It is to be surprised.

First Post 







Complex public challenges require unprecedented collaboration. The threats we face to our collective well-beinginequality, racism, civic atrophy, and other systemic failuresare too great to continue with a model that focuses primarily on developing and utilizing technology to create outsized returns for investors.
Designing and developing for the public interest differs from the process of designing for private profit. It requires genuinely interdisciplinary workdomain experts, communities, and technologists of all kinds have to bring diverse skillsets and knowledge to the table if we hope to realize the potential of technology for the public sphere.
Civic Hall Labs, the research and development arm of Civic Hall, was created to solve for this challenge. Our founders, Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry, have been working for decades to support the community of people working on tech for public goodwhich we call civic tech. Over the past few years, leaders in the civic tech community have become more vocal about the challenges and perils of rushing into social problems with tech: apotheosizing the developer, ignoring sustainability issues, and eschewing the knowledge of communities or the constraints that public interest organizations face. Building on those insights, Andrew and Micah conceived of a nonprofit that could address those concerns head on. Civic Hall Labs, designed as a collaborative R&D nonprofit, seeks to model a path forward with those lessons.
Launching from the vibrant community at Civic Hall, Labs will collaboratively design, build, and study digital tools for public good. Specifically, our work is structured to reimagine civic participation for the 21st century, expand the field of civic tech, and demonstrate a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to designing and building technology for the public good. Through Themed Labs, well bring together sector experts, the public, funders, data scientists, researchers, designers, technologists, media makers, community groups, and entrepreneurs to explore how the use of design, data, and technology can create scalable solutions around particular public issue sets.
In our Civic Xcelerator, well support non-traditional accelerator applicants in becoming civic inventors and civic entrepreneurs through part-time training in design thinking, prototyping, and startup methodology. Well also assist mid-stage, civic tech startups with strategy, legal, financing, UX, branding, and design challenges that can arise when developing a product for government or the general public.
We believe the challenges we face are complex and require a diversity of perspectives and expertise. And we believe meaningful change can result from a series of small, strategic wins that put technology at the service of experts and communities.
A number of forward-thinking partners and advisors have already signed on to our vision.
If it resonates with you, too, we invite you to learn more at civichalllabs.org, on Twitter @civichalllabs, or visit us at Civic Hall.

Civic HallCivic Tech 



For over a decade, Omidyar Network has been supporting and investing in the civic tech sector. From the very early days we have backed the most talented entrepreneurs who are seeking to use technology to empower citizens or make government more accessible, efficient, and effective. In this time, weve invested nearly $90 million in 35 nonprofit and for-profit organizations around the world.
The experience we have gained over the past ten years has led us to hold a strong conviction that these technologies can be used to improve quality of life for millions of people. We also see accumulating evidence that civic tech is gaining momentum and is increasingly attracting investment. And yet, aside from a few moments of mainstream visibility (think Healthcare.gov), it does seem as if civic tech hovers continually on the edge of taking off in ways that are both energizing (because of the potential) and frustrating (because of the pace) for those of us who have worked in the space for a considerable time.
In order to spur creative thinking about how the civic tech sector could be accelerated and expanded, we looked to Purpose, a public benefit corporation that works with NGOs, philanthropies, and brands on movement building strategies. We wanted to explore what we might learn from taking the work that Purpose has done mapping the progress of of 21st century social movements and applying its methodology to civic tech.
So why consider viewing civic tech using the lens of 21st century movements? Movements are engines of change in society that enable citizens to create new and better paths to engage with government and to seek recourse on issues that matter to millions of people. At first glance, civic tech doesnt appear to be a movement in the purest sense of the term, but on closer inspection, it does share some fundamental characteristics. Like a movement, civic tech is mission-driven, focused on making change that benefits the public, and in most cases enables better public input into decision making.
We believe that better understanding the essential components of movements, and observing the ways in which civic tech does nor does not behave like one, can yield insights on how we as a civic tech community can collectively drive the sector forward.
Today at Personal Democracy Forum in New York I was delighted to present the findings of this work and to announce the publication of the full report Engines of Change: What Civic Tech Can Learn From Social Movements.
The report provides a lot of rich insight and detail which we invite everyone to explore. Meanwhile, we have summarized five key findings:

Grassroots activity is expanding across the U.S. Activity is no longer centralized around San Francisco and New York; its rapidly growing and spreading across the U.S. In fact, there was an 81 percent increase in the number of cities hosting civic tech MeetUps from 2013 to 2015, and 45 of 50 states had at least one MeetUp on civic tech in 2015.


Talk is turning to action. We are walking the walk. One way we can see this is that growth in civic tech Twitter discussion is highly correlated with the growth in GitHub contributions to civic tech projects and related Meetup events. Between 2013-2015, over 8,500 people contributed code to GitHub civic tech projects, and there were over 76,000 MeetUps for civic tech events.


There is an engaged core, but it is very small in number. As with most social movements, civic tech has a definite core of highly engaged evangelists, advocates, and entrepreneurs that are driving conversations, activity, and events, and this is growing. The number of Meetup groups holding multiple events a quarter grew by 136 percent between 2013 to 2015. And likewise there was 60 percent growth in Engaged Tweeters in during this time period. However, this level of activity is dwarfed by other movements such as climate action.


Civic tech is growing but still lacking scale. There are many positive indications of growth in civic tech; for example, the combination of nonprofit and for-profit funding to the sector increased by almost 120 percent over the period. But while growth compares favorably to other movements, again the scale just isnt there.


Common themes, but no shared vision or identity. Purpose examined the extent to which civic tech exhibits and articulates a shared vision or identity around which members of a movement can rally. What they found is that many fewer people are discussing the same shared set of themes. Two themesopen data and government transparencyare resonating and gaining traction across the sector and could therefore form the basis of common identity for civic tech.

While each of these insights is important in its own right and requires action to move the sector forward, the main thing that strikes us is the need for a coherent and clearly articulated vision and sense of shared identity for civic tech.
If the sector can work together to deliver this, it will help attract more participants to the sector. The more people who understand what we mean when we say civic tech, the more they may see their work and interests reflected in it and will be interested to actively join the movement.
Shared identity will also be key to attracting new and different types of capital to the sectorboth nonprofit grant money and for-profit investmentbetter enabling investors to understand the collective impact the sector is seeking to deliver.
And finally, attracting more talent and more capital will ultimately drive greater impact.
We hope that this research and the findings will be the start of a new dialogueand debatethat will encourage others to add to and extend what we have started, ultimately delivering a stronger, more vibrant and impactful civic tech sector, creating real engines of change for the future.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announces the next leaders debate will be broadcast on Facebook Live.
Australian Debates Go from Tired and Predictable to New and ... Well SeePrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten will try a new format in their third debate match-up: Facebook Live.
The debate, which will be hosted by Facebook and the News Corp Australia-owned news.com.au, could take place as early as next week.
These are the platforms that many people, many would say most Australians, see most of their media on, most of their news, and I think its important that we have an innovative election and that we use the platforms that Australians use, said Turnbull, whose challenge to Shorten to hold a debate online was readily accepted. This will enable millions of Australians to participate, they will be able to contribute, it will engage a vastly wider audience than the formats that weve used before, Turnbull added.  Daniel Sankey, editor of news.com.au, emphasized the potential for interactivity: The Facebook Live platform will give all Australians the ability to not just watch, but to actively participate, in the debate.  Previous Debates Fail to Engage VotersPhillip Coorey, the Australian Financial Reviews chief political correspondent, has a good overview of the two earlier debates featuring Turnbull and Shorten. The first, a town-hall style peoples forum hosted by the pay-channel Sky News, attracted only 37,000 viewers; networks refused to carry it. A more structured debate featuring a panel of journalists attracted more viewersshown on two ABC channels, it had a combined average viewing audience of 628,000but drew criticism for the candidates mostly scripted responses. That debate, wrote Coorey, cast fresh doubt on the future of what has been an election campaign staple amid concerns it has become a tired and obsolete format.
Shorten attended another Sky News peoples forum Wednesday, but Turnbull skipped it, choosing instead to do a news program. The Guardian tracked both events.  Wither the Worm?Meanwhile, Fleur Anderson, also writing for the Financial review, notes that the audience engagement tool known as the worm is becoming an endangered species, overtaken by a force known as Twitter. As much as they publicly deny it, both Labor and Coalition campaign headquarters are scrutinising social media mentions to gauge their candidates performance. So far Mr. Turnbull is winning the mentions contest hands down over Bill Shorten, writes Anderson. But as Jonathan Harley, Twitters head of media partnerships, observes: a mention does not equal affection and followers do not equal electibility. It would appear the ultimate audience-tracking beast is still elusive. For me, the most perfect and powerful data would be if we could track sentiment live through an election debate, or through an entire campaign, said Harley. We are not quite there yet.  Read more at Civicist about the use of the worm in political debates.  EU ReferendumWith the polls suggesting that the EU referendum is too close to call at the moment, much of Britains European fate lies in the hands of the voters who still havent firmly made up their minds, writes Marcus Roberts, an executive project director at YouGov. Those undecided voters also happen to be big TV watchers, notes Roberts, so the televised debates and other events are likely to be influential. On Tuesday night, Prime Minister David Cameron and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared separately in an ITV event titled Cameron and Farage Live: The EU Referendum. They each underwent 30 minutes of grilling from a studio audience but didnt debate each other.
ITV on Thursday will hold a UK-wide referendum debate, featuring a slate of politicians, including Scotlands first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Representatives of both sides will answer questions from the audience and take part in a free-flowing debate. ITV is soliciting questions via debate@itv.com. Heres a full list of EU debates leading up to the vote on June 23. The list includes an event sponsored by Buzzfeed and Facebook on June 10 that Cameron is scheduled to attend.  Jamaica: Lessons LearnedThe decision by former prime minister Portia Simpson Miller not to participate in a national debate was a fatal error that cost the then ruling Peoples National Party the election, according to a formal review of the partys defeat. Post-election polls and focus groups have indicated that this was the main reason we lost the election, reported the committee commissioned to assess the loss, according to the Jamaica Observer. The decision also created the notion that the party was arrogant and nonchalant in its treatment of the public in general.
 U.S. Presidential Debates
Places, Everyone: Does the Libertarian campaign have a shot at the presidential debates? The poll numbers are encouraging, writes Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan. Meanwhile, The Hill published a column by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein advocating that the debates be open to all candidates who are on the ballot for a majority of voters, representing a potential majority of electoral college votes. This rule would typically give us debates with 4 to 6 candidates in total.
 Debating Our Future: The University of Notre Dames 2016 Forum will consider the presidential campaign through the lens of debates past and present and look at the role of debates in the democratic process.
The forums first event in September features a conversation among presidential debate moderators Jim Lehrer and Bob Schieffer, along with Dorothy Ridings, former president of the League of Women Voters. Both Ridings and Lehrer are members of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Notre Dame president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, also a member of the Commission, will serve as convener.
State Debates
New Jersey: We previously highlighted a scheduled primary debate between 1st Congressional District Rep. David Norcross, a Democrat, and his progressive challenger, Alex Law, noting that a diverse coalition of groups was backing the debate. Fuggedaboudit.
Law pushed for more public access and livestreaming, and ultimately the NAACP committee organizing the event pulled out. Norcross defeated the 25-year-old challenger handily in Tuesdays primary. We have proof that if you come after one of us, you come after all of us, State Sen. James Beach, the Camden County Democratic Party chairman, told a cheering crowd celebrating Norcrosss victory.
 New York: Adding to the number of editorials and columns weve highlighted advocating for local debates, columnist Michael Fitzgerald makes the case for debates in the Finger Lakes region, particularly around water quality issues. Candidates in other parts of New York are lining up for the chance to discuss the issues. Democrats in the 24th Congressional District have agreed to take part in three debates in the last week before the June 28 primary, and Democratic and Republican primary candidates in the 19th District have committed to a series of debates. At least one of the debates in both races will be televised.  Oregon: The Oregonian editorial board is encouraging Gov. Kate Brown, who assumed the office following the resignation of her predecessor, to take part in debates with her Republican opponent. When youve gotten to the point where a quarter of your counties are suing you [over mandates], committing to a series of appearances and debates in rural as well as urban areas is the least you can do, reads the editorial.  Utah: The Utah Debate Commission, which formed in 2014 following years of sporadic debates in that state, has announced a busy debate schedule for gubernatorial, attorney general and U.S. Senate races, along with debates for four Congressional districts. Debates will be held at universities and colleges around the state.  Colorado: All five Republican U.S. Senate candidates took part in a debate Wednesday hosted by The Gazette and KKTV at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. The debate was broadcast live and streamed on gazette.com. The primary is June 28.  Missouri: Republican gubernatorial candidates engaged in a debate this week that was noteworthy because of who wasnt there: an audience. The four candidates gathered at Fox 2s studios for a debate moderated by Fox anchors and the St. Louis Post-Dispatchs political editor. The televised debate was also shown on Fox 2s Facebook page and livestreamed on STLtoday.com.  Washington: The newly formed Washington State Debate Coalition is aiming to hold three gubernatorial debates and three U.S. Senate debates this fall. All of the major networks, along with local PBS and Spanish language stations, have agreed to cover the debates live. Now its a matter of securing locationsand candidate commitments, Diane Douglas, executive director of Seattle City Club, which organized the coalition, tells the Herald. The group is also working on debate formats and is looking to involve both in-studio and TV-viewing audiences.

Election 2016Rethinking DebatesSocial Media 





Twitter has saved this Spanish town 13 percent ($380,000) of the annual budget every year since 2011, Mark Scott reports for the New York Times. More than half of the 3,500 residents have Twitter accounts and interact with town officials online almost daily. Read to appreciate the experiment in digital democracy, but try not to gag at the obelisk topped with a Twitter bird! I mean, reallyTwitters a tool not a god, people.


Alex Soble explains how Code for Boston contributes to his work with Somerville Public Schools.


Although the e-gov transformation has been much slower than expected, conditions are finally ripe for real change, writes William Eggers in this excerpt from his new book, Delivering on Digital: The Innovators and Technologies that are Transforming Government, published on Nextgov.


Related: Leah Bannon and Noah Manger from 18F report on the work that 18F has done with the Federal Election Commission.


The floodgates for post-Bernie takes have opened. Writing in the New York Times, Emma Roller reports on more than a dozen conversations with Sanders supporters, including the former Occupy Wall Street activist Winnie Wong. This is a movement, Wong told Roller. It is not about Bernie Sanders. Hes a part of this movement. Many of the other supporters Roller spoke with said that, although they were not politically engaged before the Sanders campaign, that they will continue to be politically active in the future and maybe even run for office.


Between the AP proclamation and the Tuesday primary election results there was a Wikipedia skirmish over the meaning of presumptive and how might a statement on what will happen affect what does happen, expertly narrated by Sam Roudman at Vocativ.


The technology and privacy researcher Jacob Appelbaum resigned from his position at the Tor Project amid allegations of sexual and emotional abuse, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired. In a statement, Appelbaum denied the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct, and claimed they are part of a smear campaign. The journalist Quinn Norton attested on Twitter to hearing first-hand stories from people who said they had been harassed and threatened by Appelbaum, although she clarified that none of them, men or women, were sexual victims. Although most of the people who have come forward have remained anonymous, Nick Farr shared a story on Medium about Appelbaums verbal abuse and harassment, calling him an epic asshole, although, again, Appelbaum does not deny being an assholejust the criminal sexual misconduct.


Sharing alternatives: In response to the growing number of negative #AirbnbWhileBlack anecdotes, two separate start-upsNoirbnb and Noirebnbhave sprung up in response, Jessica Guynn reports for USA Today.


Too radical for HBO: In a blog post published earlier this week, the Debt Collective condemned the HBO show starring John Oliver, Last Week Tonight, for their failure to credit the group for inspiring and helping to make the debt forgiveness stunt from Sundays episode a reality. At the last minute, the post reads, [researcher Charles] Wilson told us LWT did not want to associate themselves with the work of the Rolling Jubilee due to its roots in Occupy Wall Street. Instead John Oliver framed the debt buy as his idea: a giveaway to compete with Oprah. The lead researcher who worked on this segment invoked the cover of journalism to justify distancing themselves from our project.


A different kind of culture hacking: Lin-Manuel Miranda took to the pages of the New York Times to decry the bots that are coming between people and his musical, Hamilton, and to express support for stricter laws for knowingly reselling tickets procured with ticket bots.

First Post 





Packed breakout session at Personal Democracy Forum 2013.

This year at Civic Halls Personal Democracy Forum we will have more than two dozen breakout panels across the two days of the conference, covering many aspects of civic tech, organizing and activism, current ideas and controversies, media innovation, culture hacking, and digital government. Heres your guide to whats on tap, grouped by subject. Were still adding a handful more speakers and panels, so check this page regularly for updates.
Civic Tech
Introducing the Civic Tech Field Guide
Civic tech, or the use of technology for the public good, is made up of hundreds of discrete projects, tools, platforms, organizations, and social processes. At this panel/workshop, well share the results of an ongoing field scan to identify all of the information currently available about the state of civic tech, and offer a working taxonomy that sorts this information into easy-to-understand categories. The civic tech field guide aims to make it easier for people to understand where they fit, help newcomers learn from the experience of veterans, and move resources in productive directions.You can view and contribute to the developing Civic Tech Field Guide at bit.ly/organizecivictech. Speakers: Micah L. Sifry, Erin Simpson, Matt Stempeck
Civic Features: When Platforms Do Public Good
There are standalone civic tech products, and then there are civic features within mainstream tech products. Google Maps can give you directions to your polling place on election day. Bing can show you how candidates are polling. Facebook can point you to your local elected officials once you friend your Members of Congress. Embedding civic actions in the products already used by millions of people allows us to increase our impact by orders of magnitude. What does it take to embed civic good in the worlds biggest platforms? What do we need to do to encourage more of it? Come discuss with some of the civic product designers who have done it. Speakers: Ellora Israni, Jacob Schonberg, Betsy Aoki, and Matt Stempeck (moderator)
At the End of Every Data Point is a Human Being: Technology for the Global Refugee Crisis
The global refugee crisis is posing one of the biggest humanitarian challenge of our time. In twelve months, millions more people around the world will likely be refugees, some will have found refuge or returned home, and all will continue to develop their own innovations to secure safe passage and livelihood for their families. In the same timeframe, will members of the tech and media communities still be exploring ways and remain committed to support refugees, or will we have moved on?  While part of the tech community has been discussing how to help, it seems like the current thrust of technology responses is considering refugees only as victims, and developing solutions often taking refugees out of the equation by being about them as opposed to developed with them. You cant hack a solution if you dont have all stakeholders at the proverbial table. On the other hand, peopleoften including policymakersexhibit luddite tendenciesand seem to see technology usage by refugees as a demonstration of their self-sufficiency as opposed to a tool of lifesaving necessity.
So what do we talk about when we talk about hacking the refugee crisis? Where is the line in appropriate tech responses in a situation where both crisis and chronic challenges are experienced by refugees at the same time? In this panel, we will explore: What is the situation on the ground in multiple global regions? What are refugees telling us? What does getting involved mean for the civic tech community? What can we do in the short term? In the long term? (Whos sticking around?) What is the tech refugees need? What does impact look like? Speakers: Lina Srivastava, Antonella Napolitano, Sarnata Reynolds, Abdi Nor Iftin, Yvette Alberdingk Thijm (moderator)
Ethical Frameworks for Civic Tech
Do we need a shared code of ethics/set of guiding principles for the field of civic tech? Data privacy and security, growth hacking, behavioral design, micro-targeting, AI and the like are having tremendous impact on our private lives raising ethical questions at every turn. Leveraging these 21st century tools within the realm of civic tech is possibly wrought with ethical dilemmas when used with the general public. How do we as practitioners in a growing field ensure the design and use of technology for the public goodcivic techbe done in a responsible, ethical way? That the practices around design are not only human-centric, but community-centric? That the philosophy behind responsive UX and UI go beyond the Silicon Valley model? And that AI and micro-targeting dont further institutionalize racism online? Speakers: Sunita Grose, Emily Jacobi, Deena Rosen, and Elizabeth Stewart (moderator)
Bid With, Not For: Building Empathy Into Selling Civic Tech
Civic tech has a sustainability problem. For all the funding that has been sunk into promising civic startups and projects over the past 10 years, there are precious few examples of successful businesses serving the public good. Its unlikely that every civic tech project can find a sustainable revenue model. But those companies that have market fit in the civic space need to sell, sell, sell. This panel will focus on what it takes to sell civic tech with authenticity. Well explore why business development and sales skills are often anathema to civic entrepreneurs. And well discuss how user-centric practices like empathy and active-listening, can help us align our drive to good with the need for reliable revenue. Speakers: Christie George, Ariel Kennan, Chris Maddox, and Lawrence Grodeska (moderator)
Movement vs Sector: How Civic Tech Can Combine Both to Succeed
This panel will explore what similarities, if any, the civic tech sector shares with 21st century social movements and what it can learn from these to drive participation, engagement, action and impact. It will draw on new research from movement mapping specialists Purpose that helps illuminate the new challenges and opportunities facing the civic tech sector. Speakers: Stacy Donohue, Natalie Foster, Mariana Ruiz Firmat, Jeremy Heimans, and David Eaves (moderator)
Community Partnership Models for Civic Tech (Sponsored by Microsoft)
As the civic tech ecosystem grows, companies, nonprofits and community organizations are experimenting with a wide range of models for working together on common concerns. This panel will look at emerging patterns, drawing from the work that Code for America, DataKind, Microsoft and others have embarked upon in the last couple of years. Speakers: Mischa Byruck, Julia Rhodes Davis, Elsa Sze, Andrew Singleton, Annmarie Levins (moderator)
Engagement is a Two-Way Street: Lessons From Data-Driven Cities (Sponsored by Bloomberg Philanthropies)
Partners in Bloombergs What Works Cities initiative will share learnings from 30-plus participating cities across the United States, with a look at how city leaders are using the civic tech tools of open data portals and policies, performance management and behavioral science to help local governments build relationships with residents and make better decisions in the process. Speakers: Beth Blauer, John Wonderlich, Elspeth Kirkman, and Simone Brody (moderator)
 
Organizing and Activism
#BlackPoliticsMatter 
In a followup to her main hall talk at Personal Democracy Forum 2014, Dr. Kimberly C. Ellis (aka @DrGoddess on Twitter) will host a panel discussion on the emerging role of #BlackTwitter into the popularity of the movement with a hashtag activism of #BlackLivesMatter. The panel will look at how the movement for Black lives has emerged on the social network and the further application of tech innovation to civic engagement, as people move to turn the pain of poverty, police brutality, and other forms of injustice into actualized, political power beyond street protests and media misrepresentation. Speakers: Lizz Brown, J. Matthew Williams, Marcus Ferrell, and Kimberly C. Ellis (moderator) 
Fighting Dystopia: Local Communities and Global Issues in Surveillance
At every level of zoom, from our international communications infrastructure to our everyday neighborhood interactions, surveillance is a pervasive and growing threat. But the ways in which we address that threat vary, from advancing the adoption of encrypted messaging to pushing for law enforcement reform and oversight. In this panel, we look first at local activism, especially among communities that have been marginalized and subjected to disproportionate invasions of privacy. Then, well move to U.S. federal policy battles over our right to secure communications, and international anti-surveillance tactics. Throughout these discussions, well keep an eye on the ways that technology has helpedand hinderedthe efforts to push back against a mass surveillance dystopia. Speakers: Esraa al Shafei, Parker Higgins, Evan Feeney, and Harlo Holmes  (moderator)
Directed Network Campaigning: Balancing Grassroots Autonomy with Central Strategic Control
In the past 10 years, a new generation of advocacy campaigners have found ways to hand power over to their grassroots base through distributed organizing, crowdsourcing, and by building cross-movement networks. At the same time, the most successful innovators have maintained central strategic oversight and high level political and PR framing which, coupled with people-powered momentum, has produced impressive scale and real world impact. In this panel, representatives from Hollaback!, Greenpeace, and Groundswell will discuss the challenges and rewards of harnessing the power of their self-starting supporter base towards concrete campaign outcomes. Speakers: Emily May, Michael Silberman, Esther Merono Baro, Tom Liacas (moderator)
Scaling Movement Organizing in a Digital Age
This panel will look at ways to merge the traditions of mass protest and structure-based organizing with new capacities for scaling based on emerging digital tools and practices. It will draw on the distributed organizing experiences of the Bernie Sanders campaign, 350.org, the Movement for Black Lives, and Occupy Wall Street. Speakers: Nicole Carty, Zack Exley, Duncan Meisel and Allison Fine (moderator)
Transforming Advocacy in a Mobile World (Sponsored by icitizen)
The term grassroots has been used to describe the political and economic might of everyday people for more than 100 years. However, a rising tide of 21st-century tools is changing how we think about engaging our communities. This panel will discuss the changing advocacy landscape and how new mobile tools like icitizen, Hustle, Polis, and NationBuilder  can be used to collect powerful data through direct communication with your communitydata that can then be used to drive growth, participation, fundraising and awareness while measuring the impact your efforts are having. Speakers: Mark Keida, Perry Lowenstein, Hilary Doe, Kendall Tucker, and Russ Reeder (moderator)
Ideas and Controversies
The Business Case for Encryption: Why Privacy and Data Rights Matter 
With the U.S. government and the tech industry at loggerheads, this panel will look at the issues raised by the fight for strong encryption, including: Whats at risk with weak or non-existent encryption? Should users be offered the opportunity to encrypt their own data? Is encryptionor the lack of ita civil rights issue? Given demands by many governments for backdoors to data on encrypted devices, how should and can companies respond? How long will it be before more companies are in a situation similar to Apple? What are the long-term implications for privacy and data rights? Speakers: Nabiha Syed, Peter Micek, Michael Connor, Priya Kumar, and Katie Benner (moderator)
Donald Trump: Fluke or Harbinger of a New Model?
After the presidential election of 2012, conventional wisdom among campaign strategists and political scientists alike has held that successful national campaigns require an intensive investment in voter data, analytics, and computational management of volunteers and field. Donald Trumps successful bid for the GOP nomination appears to upend those arguments, as he defeated the rest of the Republican field by relying heavily on free and social media and, seemingly, little else. This panel will explore the question of whether Trumps rise through the Republican field should be seen as a unique occurrence, or as a harbinger of other similarly-styled campaigns to come. Speakers: Aaron Ginn, Dave Karpf, Sasha Issenberg, Zeynep Tufekci, and Nancy Scola (moderator)
Platform Design and the New Labor Economics
On April 21st, Uber announced settlements in two class-action lawsuits over whether Uber drivers should be classified as independent contractors or employees. While the rulings affirmed the independent contractor classification, the changes Uber agreed to make in its own practicesgreater transparency in driver ratings, support of platforms for aggregating drivers voices, institution of procedures for resolution of grievances, etc.are a recognition that Uber is not just a platform for consumers to get a ride. It is a also a means of providing livelihoods for increasing numbers of people.
Several years ago, researchers with the Institute for the Future pointed out that we are at the beginning of an historic transformation in the nature of work and structure of American jobs. A host of technologiesfrom automation to digital platforms for coordination of tasksare reinventing not just what people do to earn a living but at a much deeper level how we organize to create value. These apps are quickly becoming our entry points for work, gateways to peoples livelihoods. Whether or not platform creators realize it, they are engaging in socioeconomic design, the design of systems that people will rely on to structure their work, earnings, daily schedules.
This panel will look at how we can design platforms that not only maximize profits for their owners but also provide dignified and sustainable livelihoods for those who work on them. In this session, Institute for the Future researchers will share their latest research on platform economy, both from the perspective of latest technologies as well as experiences of workers currently engaged in on-demand work. Speakers: Marina Gorbis, Rod Falcon, Devin Fidler, and Natalie Foster
Is the Civic Tech Story Broken?
We have an expectations problem in the civic tech world that is making donors waste money and social justice projects waste opportunities. When foundations and executives expect technology to create rapid results, or massive results, they can set up their tools and their teams to fall short. And simplistic expectations mess up the incentives for advocates and donors alike. Advocates will keep talking like tech utopians even when they know better, to secure funds; and donors will smooth over tech projects that underperform, to tell an easier story to their boards and their peers.
To fix these mismatches in expectations, civic tech needs a better story. One that celebrates not just innovation but alignment between donor missions, tool designs, and local impacts. One that rescues the word learning from the stigmas of evaluation and failure and gets people across the civic tech ecosystem to celebrate project shortfalls for what they teach us about not repeating our mistakes. Our panel of experts from the tech and donor communities will come with good and bad stories from the expectations gap, and well work with session attendees to brainstorm new stories that will help civic tech strengthen its realism and its civic conscience. Speakers: Shaifali Puri, Sam Dorman, Elizabeth Eagen, and Jed Miller (moderator)
Media Innovation
Data-Driven Journalism
From tracking political advertising in real-time to discovering the hidden authors of legislative amendments to predicting the likely outcomes of policy fights, data scientists and investigative reporters are finding new ways to track the ins and outs of the political process. This panel will offer several case studies of path-breaking tools and how they are being used to improve journalism. Speakers: William Li, Nancy Watzman, Alex Wirth, Joanna Kao, and Erhardt Graeff (moderator)
Tech and Political Debates
Televised debates have come to drive the political narrative, but how well do they actually serve the interests of voters? Many members of the public now watch debates while commenting using a second screen, or searching for information in real-time as the debate unfolds. This panel will look at current efforts to use interactive technology to make debates more responsive to voter questions and concerns, drawing on recent experiments in the United States and overseas. Speakers: Erica Anderson, Lilia Tamm, Adam Green and Christine Cupaiuolo (moderator)
Dont Be OverchargedHow Open Data is Changing the Political Ad Marketplace (sponsored by Comscore)
How do we create situations where truly competitive down ballot campaigns can be run without spending millions of dollars? This panel will look how this shift is starting to play out, focusing on of DeRay McKesson, who recently ran for mayor of Baltimore. From buying more digital, creative creation costs going down, to exposing closely held industry data on what ad inventory really costs because of recent FCC rulings requiring broadcasters, cable, and radio to publicly and digitally report what commercial inventory they sold to which candidates and PACs for what price. As more data becomes available, it becomes a pure economic case study of the cost of search going down for everyone. This helps creates a situation where truly competitive down ballot campaigns can be run without spending millions of dollars. Come learn how open data in the ad marketplace is shaking up the status quo. Speakers: DeRay McKesson, John Pudner, Carol Davidson, Jen Nedeau (moderator)
Culture Hacking
Divided and United States: How Stories Can Change the Conversation
With race and class seemingly dividing Americans more than any time in recent memory, culture is often the place where we hash out our differences. Politics and policy follow. During this session, we will look at how a new breed of artists and community organizers are using new forms of story-telling to help us listen to each other and understand each other better. Speakers: Luna Malbroux, Annabel Park, Kenyatta Cheese, and Andrew Slack 
#GivingTuesday: The Growth of a New Global Civic Tech Model
#GivingTuesday is a not just a day of giving, it is a social movement, one that has opened a global conversation about giving in all its forms. It has led to a remarkable increase in donations on the day following CyberMonday, but has also inspired a new level of innovation, creativity, collaboration, civic engagement, and capacity-building across multiple industries, demographics, and regions. What can we learn from #GivingTuesday about how much inclusive, open-sourced movements can achieve? Speakers: Asha Curran, Lucy Bernholz, Aaron Sherinian and Deanna Zandt (moderator)
Digital Government
Building a More Awesome Government: Case Studies from the U.S. Digital Service
Since its establishment nearly two years, the U.S. Digital Service, an arm of the White House, has moved to dramatically upgrade how federal agencies make, acquire and deploy technology. On this panel well hear from three USDS staffers about their work with the Department of Education, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Speakers: Erie Meyer, Emily Tavoulareas, Eduardo Ortiz, Ibrahim Abdul Matin (moderator)
Digital Strategies for Government
The idea that government agencies need to move aggressively to modernize their information technology services, upgrade their use of digital platforms, and hire the talent that can actually implement these approaches is starting to take hold across government. On this panel well hear from leaders who are taking the 18F gospel into Congress, into the states, and into the heart of New York Citys government. Speakers: Seamus Kraft, Travis Moore, Robin Carnahan, Jessica Singleton, Lorelei Kelly (moderator)
Open Data Policy and Practice: A Tale of Two Cities
In many major cities, open data is moving beyond activism and into implementation. This panel will look at the experience of two such places, New York City and Los Angeles, seeking to understand the components of successful open data strategy. The panel will include a mix of political decision-makers and open data users, and will look at questions like: Who owns data quality? How can we use design help to answer that question? How can we decouple data interfaces to better suit the needs of disparate users? How to improve the accountability of open data practices? Speakers: Vyki Englert, Sarah Henry, Ben Kallos, Gale Brewer, Melissa Mark-Viverito (welcome remarks), and David Eaves (moderator)
Can Tech Change Voter Turnout? (Sponsored by the Knight Foundation)
New election tech combined with corporate muscle is poised to move the needle on civic engagement in the U.S. On March 23rd, Democracy Works launched The TurboVote Challenge with Starbucks, Univision, Target, Airbnb, Spotify, Lyft, and seven other companies to help us achieve 80 percent voter turnout by 2020. Its a big idea meant to shift the narrative around voter participation and mobilize our entire society toward the goal of mass participation. So far, Starbucks has set the tone by encouraging all of their nearly 150,000 employees to sign up for TurboVote, and thats just the beginning. What would our democracy look like if every company worked to get employees and their customers more deeply engaged? Can we more companies to join in and reach millions of Americans? Can we build a coalition strong enough to last beyond this election and create historic change? Speakers: Speakers: Mike Ward, Adrienne Lever, Steven Levine, Amanda Padgett, Catherine Bracy (moderator)
Can We Build Trust in Congress? How do we sustain a public square? (Sponsored by the Democracy Fund)
Theres no doubt that public trust in Congress is at historic lows, and everyone has their pet reason. A systems analysis from the Democracy Fund and collaborators is seeking to understand the dynamics that are driving Congress capacity to respond to the needs and demands of citizens and the state of local news and participation. Is increasing digital capacity critical?  How can Congress deal with information overload? How do we invite the public to engage more deeply?  How do we sustain the production of news and information given the much lamented decline in local news outlets. Speakers: Betsy Wright Hawkings, Danielle Brian, Craig Aaron, Susie Gorden, Tom Glaiyser (moderator)

BuzzFeed has terminated an advertising deal with the Republican National Committee reportedly worth $1.3 million because they refuse to run Trump for President ads, Kyle Blaine reports for BuzzFeed. The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs, CEO Jonah Peretti wrote in an email to BuzzFeed staff Monday morning. He added, We certainly dont like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company. However, in some cases we must make business exceptions: we dont run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we wont accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.


Bernie Sanders text-heavy campaign has taken a serious physical toll on at least one Californian volunteer, Peter Dreier writes for the Huffington Post. After volunteering for the campaign for up to 10 hours a day for the past several weeks, 63-year-old Deborah Dentler woke in the wee hours of Saturday morning with an intense pain in her right arm. I guess my thumb couldnt take it all that texting and emailing, she told Deier. I was in so much pain my heart was pounding. She took the next two days off but said that if it hadnt subsided by Monday, the day before her state primary, shed volunteer through the pain anyway.


Joe Garofoli writes for the San Francisco Chronicle that the magical Bernies List must be maintained because it is a community of doers. MoveOn.orgs D.C. director Ben Wikler said, Calling it a list makes it sound like its an ATM. Its not...It is something very unique and could be very powerful in the progressive world.


What is civic tech?: Ripples from Daniel ONeils exit interview in Civicist last week continue to spread, and after the National Day of Civic Hacking this past weekend, the issue of civic tech v. community tech is on many peoples minds. In a piece posted on Medium over the weekend, Lawrence Grodeska reflects on the ghost of civic hacking past, and how CivicMakers and Code for San Francisco tried to design the weekend hackathon around community.


Our surveillance state: For the Christian Science Monitors Passcode, Evan Selinger and Woodrow Hartzog write that the most disturbing example of surveillance by facial recognitionthat they know ofis an Israeli startup called Faceception, which claims to use machine learning and facial recognition software to identify extroverts, pedophiles, geniuses, and white collar criminals and has recently been enlisted by the Department of Homeland Security to help them identify terrorists. Sounds completely reliable to me, hbu?


Global Voices is partnering with Media Cloud on a two-year project to track media bias, Shan Wang reports for Nieman Lab. Supported by a Google Digital News Initiative grant, the project will develop tools that will allow writers and researchers both within and outside the Global Voices community to explore over time how often, and how, news topics are covered.


Bigger and better: NY Tech Meetup announced yesterday that they have merged with the NY Tech Council to form NY Tech Alliance, a new organization with the mission to represent, inspire, support, and help lead the New York technology community and ecosystem to create a better future for all.


NY Tech Alliances Jessica Lawrence Quinn spoke to Crains Matthew Flamm about the merger. In the long run well be a bigger organization serving more people, Quinn told Flamm. We wont be competing for funding, and we wont need to duplicate efforts. Erik Grimmelman [the Councils CEO, who is now the Alliances president] can concentrate more on policy and advocacy, and Ill concentrate more on community programs and improving diversity in the industry.


Waze is ruining peace and quiet in neighborhoods by sending people down residential streets to avoid construction or backed-up roads, and when locals attempt a little platform disobedienceby falsely reporting wrecks or other traffic snarlerstheyre kicked off, Steve Hendrix reports for the Washington Post.

Bernie Sanders supporters are downloading the peer-to-peer texting application FireChat in preparation for protests around the Democratic National Convention in July, Ethan Harfenist and Adi Cohen report for Vocativ. The communication tool, which first became known when it was used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, connects users via wifi and bluetooth, so it doesnt need cellular networks to function.

Writing on Medium, Joshua Tauberer responds to Daniel ONeils assertion that the civic tech movement should be shelved, an opinion Tauberer strongly disagrees with. The availability of other civic activities besides civic tech hacking doesnt diminish the value of civic hacking, Tauberer points out. The important thing is just that were honest about our goals and that our goals are just.


The St. Louis police chief boasted on Twitter last week that a new, $35,000 mobile app led to an arrest after an anonymous tip for panhandling, prompting a deluge of criticisms for the STLPDs misplaced priorities amid a spike in more serious crimes, as Danny Wicentowski reported for the Riverfront Times, and for the apps extensive access to user-data, which raised questions about how anonymous anonymous tips placed on the app really are.

This isnt the way to make friends: An apartment complex in Salt Lake City recently tried to force tenants to like them on Facebook as part of an addenda to their contract, Karen Turner reports for the Washington Post. It also gave the complex permission to post photos of residents and visitors to the company Facebook page. The complex threatened tenants with a breach of contract if they failed to comply within five days. The effort backfired when residents complained about the requirement on Facebook and to a local tv station, and the page was taken down after being flooded with bad reviews and negative comments.


According to a new study by the Center for an Urban Future, participation in NYC public libraries technology training programs has risen 81 percent in just three years, I report for Civicist. The hope is that programs like this can reduce the tech talent gap in the city and diversity the tech sector, although the impact will be hard to gauge without knowing more about who is participating in the programs and whether or not the trainings help them secure employment.

Cooper Fleishman and Anthony Smith report for Mic about the disturbing trend of identifying, tracking, and ultimately harassing Jews across the internet by encasing their names with three sets of parentheses. The harassment can escalate to death threats, images from the Holocaust, and home phone calls, and there has been a spike in anti-Semitic rhetoric online which many have tied to the rise of Trump. The use of punctuation marks to single out targets has made the trend difficult to track or filter in search queries, or to flag as a kind of hate speech. (h/t Emily Jacobi)

A new report by the Center for an Urban Future has found that participation in the technology training programs offered by New York Citys public libraries increased 81 percent in just three years. The classes on offer cover everything from basic computer literacy to coding. In some cases demand far outstrips supply; for example, one program currently serves 400 people but has a waitlist of 5,000. The report concludes that public libraries could and should play an important role in increasing digital literacy and shrinking the tech talent gap.
The author of the report, Jonathan Bowles, also suggests that the programs could help diversify New York Citys tech workforce, although the data is not yet there to definitively back him up.
Bowles points out in the report that while growth in the citys tech sector has far outstripped the overall job growth in the economy, growing 71 percent from 2004 to 2014, the tech sector remains overwhelmingly white. Only 20 percent of the tech workforce is black or Hispanic. Bowles suggests that if more low-income black and Hispanic New Yorkers had the digital skills that technology employers required, the talent gap would shrink.
Civicist reached out to Bowles to see if they knew how many of the participants in the public libraries tech trainings were black or Hispanic, or if they had any way of tracking whether participants were able to find jobs in the tech sector after completing a training. The answer was no to both.
Our aim here was to do a fairly short data brief that would merely introduce this topicthe role of libraries in providing tech training, Bowles explained in an email. My sense is that most people dont think of libraries when they think of tech training, but I think the numbers we found suggest that there could be an important role (or may already be an important role) that complements some of the other efforts going on in this space.
The other efforts Bowles is referring to include Mayor Bill de Blasios Tech Talent Pipeline initiative and programs like Girls Who Code and Access Code.
That said, my strong sense is that these programs are serving a very diverse mix of New Yorkers, he added. Except for a handful of more regional branch libraries, the citys libraries tend to serve people in their communities. And in so many of the communities served by these branches, the bulk of residents are not white.
Bowles writes in the report that the majority of the programs that have seen the largest amount of growth are outside Manhattan, and of the ones in Manhattan, three are in Harlem, one on Roosevelt Island, and one in Chinatown.
In addition to offering tech training programs, the three public library systems that serve New York City have also begun lending out Wi-Fi hotspots to New Yorkers without a home internet connection, in an attempt to shrink the citys digital divide.
The Center for an Urban Future report makes a strong case for the importance of libraries in the citys broader tech ecosystem, but impact will be hard to gauge without knowing who the participants are and how they are able to put their newly-acquired tech skills to use.
The report is just one in a planned series, and Bowles confirmed for Civicist that they hope to do more research on the topic and publish a deeper dive later this year.

Is civic technology the killer app for democracy? asks Lorelei Kelly in TechCrunch. At first, it seems like its not. The killer apps for the systems on which we rely daily wont be technical, they will be human, Kelly writes. The killer app for [the DC] Metro would have to get political leaders to look beyond their narrow, short-term interests and be willing to invest in modern public transportation for our national capital region. Boy, that would be some app! Whos building that?
But the solution isnt not-technical either, of course. It will be Americans working together to build a technology-enabled resilient democracyone that is inclusive, responsive, and successful in the Information Age.
Civic technology...might give Americans the chance to renew public life by making democracy more visible and intentional, Kelly writes.
So is civic tech the killer app for democracy? It might be! TBD.


This is civic tech: In France, a lawyer and an engineer launched an online platform to run an open primary to select a presidential candidate outside the party system, Federico Guerrini reports for Forbes. Called LaPrimaire.org, the site has already attracted 164 candidates and 26,000 voters since its launch in April.


A coalition of civil society groups have published a letter condemning the FBIs proposal to exempt its biometric database from the Privacy Act, Ava Kofman reports for The Intercept. If given an exemption, the public would be unable to identify or address inaccuracies in the database.

This is community tech: I interview Civicists newest contributing editor, Daniel ONeilwho recently announced that he is leaving Smart Chicago to join the company working on vets.govabout his five years leading a civic/community tech organization, the meaning of community tech, and why the hack night model (among other civic tech trends) has run its course.


Tech and the presidentials: Trump recently told The Associated Press that he thinks the use of data in elections is overrated and that there will be limited data use in his camp, Thomas Beaumont reports for the AP. Trump lags far behind the Clinton campaign in its use of voter data, Thomas Beaumont writes, and may not be able to catch up in time. Turmoil in his team hasnt helped; Rick Wiley, a senior advisor who claimed Trump would have a state of the art campaign and would absolutely use data, which he also called invaluable, has left the campaign since making those comments.


For the LA Review of Books, Civicist contributing editor An Xiao Mina interviews Negar Mottahedeh about her recent book about the 2009 Iranian Presidential election and the role of social media in the Green Movement.


A new study by NewsWhip reveals that there has been a noticeable decline in engagement with non-video media content posted on Facebook over the past few months, Matthew Ingram reports for Fortune, a likely result of Facebooks push into the video and livestreaming space. The top 10 publishers have seen likes drop by 55 percent between July 2015 and April 2016, shares fall 57 percent, and comments plummet 64 percent. Many of those publishers are being paid by Facebook to produce live videos for the platform. I wonder how they feel about those deals now.


Civil society groups in the EU are up in arms over the European Commissions proposed link tax, also known as ancillary copyright, and are encouraging consumers to weigh in on the issue before the EC closes the public comment period.

Smart Chicago attended a recent meeting of the Police Accountability Task Force to document the community's input. (Photo: Daniel O'Neil)

On Friday, Daniel ONeil announced that he was leaving Smart Chicago after five years to join Ad Hoc LLC, the company recently hired to build vets.gov, where he will work on product development and business strategy. Civicist reached out to discuss Daniels departure, the lessons he has learned over the years, and where he sees civic technology going.
Were also thrilled to announce that as of today Daniel will be joining Civicists roster of contributing editors. We look forward to sharing his work more frequently!
Civicist: How did your work at Smart Chicago change over your five years as executive director?
Daniel ONeil: The main shift that I can describe is one from civic tech to community technology. When we first started, I had just left EveryBlock, where we pioneered open data and were deeply enmeshed in the new civic tech movement. At Smart Chicago, some of the first things we did were hosting hackathons, writing open data policies for municipalities, and starting projects with Code for America.
There was a lot of hope that civic tech would lead to new businesses and create new ways for people to interact with their government. Smart Chicago was at the center of all of that nationally. As time went by, however, we found that the people we were working with were all high-capacity, highly educated technologists. They were all very nice people and they had perfectly good ideas, but they werent the core people we were built to work with.
And after some time, we saw that we werent creating that much technology that actually helps people. This was around the time that there was a lot of questioning of the model of hackathons, when we decided/convinced ourselves that building community in this space was a goalthat having hackathons was less about the tech and more about the community.
The funny thing is that all of this was already built into our organization before I got here. We were charged with spending tens of millions of dollars in BTOP money. This was money for innovative community strategies, digital skills initiatives, new hardware in libraries, and public housingthings of that kind. I had a background in community technology, but I think I had an arrogance about tech.
A lot of it was an educationand sometimes not a very pleasant one. I was a believer in open data, a believer in the power of technology to help people, a believer in the founding idea that technologists could solve problems if they just coded the right things. I came to see the limits of these tools and the value of bringing technologists together without a community context.
Whats wrong with building community?
When you build a community, as it is currently defined in civic tech, you are by definition ignoring the existence of the other people who live near you and you supposedly seek to serve.
When you seek to have a hack night or a hackathon or some other tech-focused event, an enormous amount of the time is spent on explaining the frameof telling people what you care about (civic tech), of your skills (coding, UX, whatever), of your interests (the common good).
It wastes time.
There are so many meetings, so many places where people gather to discuss their common interests and goals. Go to them!
You mean existing meetings? Is the main problem that these community-building groups are actually being created as separate and apart from existing community groups?
Exactly.
And then we create our own clumsy structures which are designed to (supposedly) circle back to community need.
By meeting I mean any place where regular residents gather to talk about our shared lives. In almost all instances, there are parts of those meetings that relate to technical needs. The problem is that when we invite people to civic tech meetings, we are necessarily leading with our framework (we love civic tech and we think we can use it to solve your problems!) rather than simply being present with them.
We try to foster that with our Smart Chicago Documenters program, where we pay people to attend public meetings.
Our Smart Health Centers program is another example. We designed it around human needs around health-care tech like patient portals and health-oriented content on the web. Youth-Led Tech, where we meet the needs of youth and employ young people who are starting tech careers.
At a recent meeting of the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force at a local high school, residents were able to speak about their concerns, their specific needs, hopes, and dreams. They were deeply engaged with government, all night. It was then taken over by protesters. Smart Chicago was there to document the whole thingto hear their voices, to listen to and record what they had to say. It was not theoretical.
So what exactly are you doing differently, to meet people where they are? These are still Smart Chicago-created programs, right?
Yes, they are all programs invented at and run by Smart Chicago.
But we left 1871, the downtown incubator we had worked out of for years. We stopped doing event programming with civic tech people altogether. We hired fewer Rails and Django programmers at $125/hour and hired more instructors to teach kids how to make WordPress websites at $15-20/hour.
And we literally do meet people where they are. Weve conducted CUTGroup tests in about 20 libraries, all over the county. Smart Chicago is teaching 30 youth in the juvenile detention center, talking about the Internet of Things in neighborhoods. We do the work.
The turning point for us was in February 2013 when we launched the Civic User Testing Group. As I wrote in the Origins chapter of The CUTGroup Book, we failed at getting regular residents to show up to our programs:
I realized that with a value proposition that starts with If you develop an app, there was no way we were going to get regular people to show up. We were offering $15,000 in prizes in four cities, but our program was too involved:


Come to a meeting on a weeknight


Develop/present an original idea for an app


Persuade one or more developers to build the idea


Follow the process through to completion


Submit the finished site/app


Prosper


When we got to Bellevilleas far south as one could get in Illinoiswe had the mayor, some developers from St. Louis, and zero members of the public. There had to be an easier way.

So I invented a specific, detailed methodology to engage residents around technology. That was where things changed for us.
What would you have done differently from the beginning, knowing what you know now?
I would have immediately built jobs programs for regular people in technology. Things like Smart Health Centers and Youth-Led Tech. I never would have created programs that focused on high-tech solutions built by high-tech people.
Whats next for Smart Chicago? What would you like to see the organization accomplish after youve left? If you were staying for another five years, what programs would you start, continue, or end?
The Chicago Community Trust, along with The MacArthur Foundation, will lead the search for a new executive director. Theyre looking for a national leader who will be based in Chicago and who can continue to lead the way in community-based technology work.
In the meantime, Kyla Williams, who has been at Smart Chicago nearly from the start, is the interim executive director. She is an inventive, creative leader who has been at the heart of things and she will continue the work.
If I were staying another five years, I would want to go way harder at community engagementfind more ways to allow people to speak with each other, make joint decisions, plan our shared lives. We have very few methods for this. There is enormous segregation in this city. People are rarely invited outside of their own neighborhoods to share discussion. It needs a lot of work.
Whats the one thing the civic tech movement needs more than anything else? Or should the movement be shelved entirely in favor of community tech?
Yes, the civic tech movement should be shelved. It has run its course. The models of hack nights and civic apps and techno-determinist solutions have proven ineffective.
The dominant social movements of the last five years have next to nothing to do with civic tech. Black Lives Matter, the rise of racist Trumpian political ideas, marriage equitythey owe nothing to civic tech.
These forces used consumer-grade technology like Twitter and Facebook to drive their agendas while civic tech people are checking in code to Github.
Although you are describing a fairly common understanding of civic tech, Civic Hall co-founders Micah Sifry and Andrew Rasiej have proposed a big tent definition of the term, which I think is broad enough to include Smart Chicagos community technology organizing, the kind of government technology work that Ad Hoc LLC does, as well as the apps and tools produced by the civic tech and open data organizers you describe above.
Yes, I have seen thatstarting with last years PDF. I was stunned and pleased to see the focus on worker movements and the needs of regular people on stage. I put a lot of stock in what Civic Hall is doing, and I believe theyve got their heads on straight.
What does this bigger, broader movement need?
It needs a general agreement by its partisans on the way forward.
We need a general agreement that we have to move from placing the alpha-geek at the center of our movement. We have to stop paying lip service to build with, not for and actually start implementing those principles into our work. We have to build on the methods we invented at Smart Chicago and make them better and more effective at discerning community need.
Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts with Civicist! Anything else youd like to add?
In five years, our team at Smart Chicago has rarely been more than three people. By keeping our heads down and working with regular Chicagoans, weve built a case for the right conceptual model for an organization that uses technology to make lives better. We need more organizations to adopt this model.

Welcome to the alt-right, a corner of the pro-Trump internet where young would-be conservatives are getting the message that to fight for free speech is to tweet anti-Semitic memes at Jewish writers, and to make casual jokes to them about the Holocaust, as Jesse Singal reports for New York Magazine.

This year, white nationalists can barely contain their excitement over the presumptive Republican nominee, writes Buzzfeeds Rosie Gray, reporting from the annual American Renaissance conference in Tennessee. While there, she encountered the alt-right in person, writing. The alt-right like to flatter themselves that they are simply an ultra-ironic, boundary-smashing, fun-loving group of shitlords who might send a few Jews some mean tweets about gas chambers, then roll their eyes at all these cucks alleging anti-Semitism.

This explains a lot: Donald Trump has gotten a huge share of the media attention going to the presidential candidates, worth an estimated $1.9 billion in free media. But according to an analysis by Parse.ly of more than one billion page views across more than 100,000 articles, Hillary Clinton actually gets more page views per article than Trump. As Parse.lys Conrad Lee writes, while journalists seem to be preoccupied with covering Trump, the public is not especially interested in reading about him. So why all the extra coverage of Trump? Because he makes it so easy, says Lee: in the midst of todays 24-7 news cycle, most journalists can devote only a small amount of time to their next article, and so they often find themselves choosing topics that are convenient to write about. Trumps constant provocations via social media are perfectly tuned to this dynamic.

More data: Bookings at Trump Hotels are down compared to last year, says HipMunks Kelly Soderlund.

The EU Referendum: Should the U.K. Stay or Should it GoPrime Minister David Cameron will not appear in a head-to-head television debate ahead of the European referendum vote on June 23. He has, however, agreed to a special BBC Question Time program before a live audience. Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who is anti-EU, will participate on a different date.

Similarly, Cameron and UKIP leader Nigel Farage will appear on an ITV News program, but both will be quizzed separately by the studio audience. ITV has put out a call for audience members to take part in the June 7 event, along with a second event on June 9 featuring political figures on both sides of the issue. On June 21, the BBC will host The Great Debate, a live, televised debate at Londons Wembley Arena featuring senior politicians and other key figures. The audience, chosen by lottery, will be split between people likely to vote to remain in the EU and those likely to vote to leave.   The Mirror hosted a debate earlier this month with a six-member panel that streamed live on the tabloids website. The studio audience was encouraged to take out their phones and tweet during the debate using the hashtag #MirrorLiveEU, and pre-selected members of the audience were called upon to ask questions.
Debates a Factor in Voter Turnout in the PhilippinesAndres Andy Bautista, head of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) in the Philippines, said the series of debates Comelec organized around the country with various media outlets contributed to high voter turnout in the presidential election this month. More than 40 million Filipinos, 81 percent of the total voters, went to the polls, surpassing voter turnout in the last presidential election in 2010.
One thing which we did differently this year as opposed to the previous elections was the presidential debates, he said, noting that holding them in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao instead of in the capital made the election more participative. The three #PiliPinasDebates2016 generated nearly 5 million tweets worldwide, according to eGov Innovation. Other numbers of note: 22 million people took part in Facebook conversations about the election, generating more than 268 million interactions, and there were more than 35 million election-related tweets.
 Australia Debate Features the Peoples ForumAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten on Sunday will take part in the first formal debate of the election campaign in prime time as they field questions from a panel of journalists. Earlier this month, Turnbull and Shorten engaged in a town-hall style debate called the peoples forum, answering questions from 100 undecided voters. The audience declared Shorten the winner. Twitter reaction and commentary is at #ausvotes.   Ghana Moves Forward with Presidential Debate PlansThe Institute of Economic Affairs in Ghana will host a debate series for presidential candidates. Three of the four qualifying parties have confirmed participation; the governing National Democratic Congress is still deciding. The National Commission for Civic Education intends to organize debates for parliamentary candidates in all 275 constituencies. General elections will be held on Nov. 7.
U.S. Debates
TBD: Presidential Debate FormatWright State University in Ohio, host to the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, is working with the Commission on Presidential Debates on finalizing the configuration of the universitys Nutter Center.  
The final format for the debate, either at podiums, a table with the moderator in the middle, or a town-hall approach, has not been agreed upon yet, Greg Lehman writes in Venues Today, a trade magazine. This is an especially important design feature since it determines the placement of the candidates, and impacts seating, as well and the configuration of the arena.
Originally told to expect between 3,000 and 4,000 members of the media, the university is now preparing for more than 5,000 and an international viewing audience of 400 million. The date of the event falls on the 56th anniversary of the first televised presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon in 1960.

Double DigitsPolls are showing growing support for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor who also ran for president in 2012, writes Nora Kelly in The Atlantic. If he can get at least 15 percent of the vote in five national surveys, hell make it onto the presidential debate stage this fallassuming, of course, he does well at the nominating convention this weekend in Orlando. In an earlier story, Kelly covers the chicken-and-egg challenge facing the Libertarian Party: getting voters attention requires participation in the general-election debates. When people watch those debates, they think those are the candidates running, said National Committee Executive Director Wes Benedict, and others must not matter if theyre not in those televised debates.   Meanwhile, RT America broadcasted Green Party and Libertarian Party primary debates. The Green Party debate included frontrunner Jill Stein; the Libertarian Party frontrunners sat out the debate.  Primary Debates #TBTAfter nine televised debates and 13 forums, the Democratic primary debate season is over, now that Hillary Clinton has decided against debating Bernie Sanders in California. Meanwhile, we have already reached the point of reviewing memorable moments from the GOP primary debates. If you feel the need to reminisce, start here. And dont miss Dahlia Lithwicks remembrance of being on the college debate circuit with former presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. Most of my memories of debating Ted Cruz involve being hollered at, she writes. I feel her pain.
State Debates
West Virginia: Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Cole has proposed seven debates around the state with Democratic nominee Jim Justice. The Justice campaign is not ruling out the possibility of debates, though the candidate did say, Bill Cole is dusting off the old political playbook. They tell me, anytime your opponent is losing, they come crying for debates. The West Virginia Press Association, West Virginia Public Broadcasting, and AARP West Virginia have stepped forward to host a gubernatorial debate on Oct. 4 with the hope of attracting both candidates. The hosts have promised comprehensive TV, radio, internet and print coverage reaching all 55 counties.   Gubernatorial Debates: Do You Care? is the headline of a WDTV story asking whether voters would rather see Justice and Cole hold multiple debates or make campaign stops around the state. Not sure why its an either-or situation. Montana: Denise Juneau, the first American Indian woman elected to statewide office in Montana and the Democratic candidate for the states lone U.S. House Seat, has called for six debates with incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Libertarian candidate Mike Fellows. Juneau suggested holding the debates in various locations around the state, including on one of Montanas seven recognized Indian reservations, with independent news or community organizations acting as moderators.  North Carolina: Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat running for governor, invited Gov. Pat McGrory to join him in two live debates and public forums. McGrory agreed to the debatesand called for two more.     Iowa: The Des Moines Register and CBS affiliate KCCI are co-sponsoring debates featuring Democratic candidates for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives (3rd Congressional District). The primary is June 7. In addition to broadcasting the debates on KCCI-TV, a livestream will be available at DesMoinesRegister.com and KCCI.com, and on the Register and the KCCI apps.
Debates are an important part of our political process that allow voters to understand where candidates stand on some of the most important issues facing our state and nation, Register Executive Editor Amalie Nash said in a statement.
In other Iowa news, a Sioux City Journal editorial praises U.S. Rep. Steve King and his Republican primary opponent, state Sen. Rick Bertrand, for agreeing to a debate on June 3 hosted by the Journal and KTIV-TV. Face-to-face debates provide, we believe, an invaluable opportunity unlike any other for the public to take the measure of candidates for office, reads the editorial. King, in particular, deserves credit for acceptance of the debate offer because, lets be honest, it would have been easy for him as a seven-term incumbent in the states most Republican congressional district to take the safe route and decline to debate his first re-election primary challenger.
 Massachusetts: Continuing a Cape Cod tradition, five Democratic and Republican candidates for the Cape & Islands District state Senate seat participated in a debate this week organized by high school students.

And they tweeted the candidates answers, too (alas, no hashtag).

Election 2016ElectionsRethinking Debates 





Tech and politics: The State Departments inspector general has issued an 83-page report that is very critical of Hillary Clintons email practices while secretary of state, Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger report for The Washington Post.

Politicos Josh Gerstein, who has done the best sustained reporting on the Clinton email mess, points out that the official report flatly rejects one of her core defenses in the controversythat she was playing by the rules.

Three-quarters of the federal governments $80 billion tech budget is spent maintaining museum-ready computer systems, the APs Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports, citing a new GAO report to Congress.

Philip Bump of the Washington Post points out that theres a connection between Clintons private email server and the governments out-of-date technology. Which is true, but not an excuse for her decision to skirt the State Departments systems, he notes.

Damn you, auto-complete!

Helaine Olen explains in Slate why robocalls are out of control, a dozen years after the launch of the federal Do Not Call Registry. The reason, she says, isnt that the government program isnt being enforced; its that the telcos arent giving their customers free and easy access to technology that would block the annoying calls. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) has a bill called the Repeated Objectionable Bothering of Consumers on Phones Act (the RoboCop Act) that would fix that problem.

Was progressive think-tank Demos right to fire poverty policy blogger Matt Bruenig Friday for his use of inappropriate and bullying language on his Twitter account? If you must read one piece about the Twitter war that broke out over the last few days, involving Bruenig, Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden, Nation writer Joan Walsh, and a horde of Twitter trolls, make it Matthew Yglesias report for Vox. He does a good job of explaining the explosive undercurrents of the conflict, though in my humble opinion he understates the obnoxiousness of Bruenigs online persona, which culminated in his calling Tanden a scumbag.


Heres Demos communications director Liz Flowers explaining the think-tanks decision to part ways with Bruenig. Even if your organization doesnt have or think it needs a social media policy, this is a cautionary tale for the age of Twitter-fueled flame wars.


Theres evidence that trolls from the depths of 4chan are also having a field day playing Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters off each other.


Life in Facebookistan: The New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg takes Facebook to task for failing to be transparent about how its algorithm decides what is news. Since Ive been on this hobby horse for a long time, lets just try a counter-factual. Is the New York Times transparent enough about how it decides what is news? (I for one would like to know how its editors decided that the right way to refer to Donald Trumps racism was to call it a reductive approach to ethnicity.)

Crypto-wars, continued: Critics of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden regularly argue that he should have tried to blow the whistle using internal channels, but as this report in The Guardian by Mark Hertsgaard shows, an earlier whistleblower who did just that, Thomas Drake, was hounded by NSA insiders for trying to do the right thing. Hertsgaards story is based on a new whistleblower, John Crane, a senior Pentagon official who says his colleagues repeatedly broke the law in order to persecute Drake.

Aspiration is preparing for the Humanitarian Technology Festival on June 4th and 5th in Cambridge, Mass. This participatory event is for field practitioners, media makers and storytellers, technology developers, information security practitioners, members of affected populations, researchers, and everyone in between. We are hoping for a strong contingent of civic tech and civic media folk as well, for reasons we hope this post will make clear. 
Humanitarian and disaster response deals with exceptional situations. But whether through historical happenstance or through poor design, response also tends to be short-sighted and deeply siloed. As crises are by definition beyond the capacity of the norm (existing infrastructure like governments), responders are often military or nongovernment organizations (NGOs). We deploy into places we do not fully understand the histories of, where we are not well connected with pre-existing efforts, and when we leave we often take our data and gained understanding with us. We too often make poor choices which deeply affect the future lives of a frontline community because it is better than doing nothing. I generally find the whole thing paternalistic and incremental when we should instead be focusing on systemic interventions to long-term issues of inequity by working with local populations to increase their capacity. A combination of coping with exceptional circumstances in a way which actively works with, depends on, and returns to pre-existing efforts is what I see in the overlap of civics and response.
Where one ends and the other begins
Civic tech is technology which enables engagement or participation of the public for stronger development, enhancing citizen communications, improving government infrastructure, and generally improving the public good. Civic media is any form of communication that strengthens the social bonds within a community or creates a strong sense of civic engagement among its residents. Then civic media and tech are deeply linked with digital disaster and humanitarian response. All are about how people work with each other and with institutions, each is about more intentional infrastructure, and each is about having an empowered public supported by institutions and a global public. The excellent book Building Resilience gives a precise overview of the strength of social capital and community ties as the leading indicator to a regions ability to cope with shocks and stressors, regardless of access to other resources. We anticipate the scenario we will be playing through at the event will get at these social ties as well as laying a baseline of understanding for those new to response. From that background theory, the practice looks like responders working with already established civic infrastructure in order to bolster those networks of trust, to benefit from that knowledge, and to have a place to return created data and delivered resources into for post-response sustainability. But where do humanitarian aid/development, civic engagement, and disaster response transition into one another? 
Civics and humanitarian aid
Digital humanitarian response could be seen as civics in places where there is not yet established technical, physical, or possibly even political infrastructure to bolster or route around. In this case, considering how the civic tools you are building apply to other locations is a useful theoretical framework. Perhaps more importantly  how could tools built elsewhere apply here? (Spoiler alert: Kenya and Tanzania have had mobile money for a looooong time, and we are only just starting to get it in the States  we have plenty to learn from other places.) Improving infrastructure is more and more grounded on baseline data, which can be collected for development purposes or as a means of civic engagement. When the creation of baseline data is happening for civic reasons, it indicates those social ties are being formed around local political empowerment, versus (the still worthwhile) baseline creation by intervening groups like UN OCHA for the sole purpose of response. Our goal in response is to only be around for as long as we are needed, but civics is about investing in a longer-term view.
Civics and disaster response
While humanitarian aid is (in part) about the creation or improvement of long-term infrastructure, disaster response is about existing infrastructure being disrupted, and not even in the questionable type of disruption from Silicon Valley, but in the sense of nothing is working the way we planned because the power and internet we have come to rely on are down and I cant find my child. In these circumstances, building tools which allow for (or even encourage!) off-the-grid communication or storage-until-able-to-update matter. As in, tools which would also work in low connectivity areas like humanitarian deployments are often better suited for crisis response than other everyday-use tools. We will be thinking about how to perform such coordination at HumTechFest, too. An aside here seems necessary, to point out that the chaos of response is in this disconnection from the infrastructures on which we depend. The chaos is not in the form of people. People are amazing, often even more so in a crisis. While most of the field of Disaster Sociology points this out, a shorter (and easy) read is  A Paradise Built in Hell.
The square you start from matters
While we can talk all day about the technology we use in our everyday lives and in times of crisis, the purpose of that technology is to help us connect with one another, to help us have safer and happier (and I would argue more dignified and coequal) lives. Social connections bolstered by mediating technology is how communities help themselves. Take Civic Halls Noel Hidalgo, and his Coworking Map during Sandy response. It is from those spaces so many of the preexisting civic tech was reapplied to the new crisis circumstance, and that people found each other in order to address their unique concerns. The strong civic ties allowed for a more robust response. The same is true of the success of Occupy Sandy, grown from the ties created during Occupy Wall Street, and for the listening centers in West Africa which became essential for information distribution during the Ebola outbreak. Caring about sharing data in advance means you can more readily ask for external help... and then hold those responding accountable because there is a baseline. 
Deepening the connection
We would love to explore this overlap further, and be more intentional in things like data hand-off and collaboration between existing community-based groups like Public Lab and Open Referral and NYC Prepared, official response organizations like FEMA and local Offices of Emergency Mangement, emergent response groups like Occupy Sandy and Boulder Relief, and back to those long-term civic groups. We would love to think about how those communication patterns might look, and what resources we can create to expedite the process. We have a lot to learn from groups like Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and Kathmandu Living Labs. As Heather Leson said in this blog post on Civicus,
How can maps and citizen-generated data empower civil society organisations to bring about change in their local community? In some parts of the world, existing physical layer maps are inaccurate and outdated. Imagine walking around your neighbourhood  do you know the names of all the streets, or where the nearest school or hospital is? With this kind of data, people are in a better position to plan futures for their communities. OSM enables each of these data items to be downloaded freely, making it a valuable civil society resource.
Projects like Promise Tracker, Taarifa, and the Riffle provide that strong baseline data which can also be useful in times of crisis, as well as the surrounding communities of practice. How excellent would it be to have all the capacity needed to respond already in any given location?! So rad. Because then it is not a crisis. When we frame response on strong civic engagement rather than a traditional perspective of short-term interventions, we are acting in a more efficacious and coequal way. We are acting in solidarity.
Join us in building this new world
We hope you will join us to be a part of this responsible lifecycle on June 4th and 5th in Cambridge, Mass at the Humanitarian Technology Festival. If you want to carpool up from NYC, we are happy to help with gas. If you are on the West Coast, we would love to see you at the June 16th Digital Responder Meet Up in San Francisco. And if you are remote to both those places, we have an ongoing mailing list and semi-regular call-ins you can join. Deep thanks to the Aspiration team, Heather Leson, Matt Stempeck, and Ethan Zuckerman for helping make this piece exist.

Civic Tech 



CNNs Christiane Amanpour moderates a UK election debate at the high-tech McLaren Thought Leadership Centre.
Case Study: Studio audience members vote on debate topics with results displayed in real-time  Country: U.K. Debate: April 21, 2015 (aired April 24)

When CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour welcomed viewers to the networks 2015 U.K. election debate, she noted that with her was an esteemed panel of politicians and an audience who will no doubt tell them exactly what they think of the big issues at the heart of this election.

She wasnt overselling the audiences role.
Airing two weeks before the May 7 election, the debate was held in the futuristic Thought Leadership Centre on the McLaren Technology Group campus in Woking, an hour outside London. From above, the Centre looks like a roulette wheel set into a green field. It doesnt actually spin, but the interior is designed to create a 360-degree visual experience.
One hundred and thirty people, selected according to U.K. guidelines on politically balanced debate audiences, were seated in the round. All were equipped with individual iPads to cast votes during the debate, with the results displayed in real time on the wall surrounding them.
Giving voters the opportunity to weigh in via apps and social media during political debates has become more common. What is unusual is the degree to which instant audience feedbackrequested multiple times on topics like immigration, the economy, and the European Unionshaped the conversation between Amanpour and the five politicians representing the leading parties.
Possibly the most remarkable aspect of the debate was how the venue itself was integral to the conversation.
Fast Cars, Thoughtful Debates
The McLaren Technology Group has its origins in a Formula One team founded by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, a race car driver and engineer who died in a crash in 1970. British businessman Ronald Dennis, now McLarens chairman and CEO, acquired the McLaren racing team, and the company expanded into car and precision manufacturing.
Today the Group includes a number of high-tech companies, including McLaren (F1) Racing, McLaren Applied Technologies, McLaren Marketing, and McLaren Automotive Limited. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II attended the opening of the McLaren Technology Centre campus, designed by the architectural firm Foster + Partners. In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron did the honors, opening the McLaren Production Centre, a high-performance road car assembly facility.
In early 2015, CNN and McLaren entered into a multi-year partnership that involved the network becoming the McLaren-Honda partner for the 2015 Formula 1 season and use of the Thought Leadership Centre, the newest addition to campus headquarters, to produce programs that would be broadcast globally.
The U.K. debate was the first event under the new agreement; CNN has since hosted a look at world events over the past three decades and a discussion on climate change, ahead of the Paris 2015 Climate Conference.
The Centre was conceived as an interactive event spacea modern arena for global leaders to use advanced technology to communicate ideas. Built on two tiers, the facility has an auditorium on top (where the debate was held), and a theater space below, and is connected to the rest of the campus via a tunnel on which film and images can be projected.

Photos and design details are available at the websites of Cinimod Studio, which installed the integrated lighting and audio components, and Lucas, which handled the final finishes. The engagement company Concise explains the event app it created for McLaren, on which interactive content can be uploaded and branded.
No detail was left to chance. We interrogated all of the seats functions until we were happy with the height, movement, and the manner in which it self-centered and levelled. We put these seats through the same level of evaluation that we use in testing our cars, Dennis told a commercial interior magazine.
If James Bond called a meeting, it would be held here.
Prior to the U.K. election debate, Dennis noted the space offers every single participant the opportunity to engage, direct, and communicate with every other person within the space.
For a broadcaster such as CNN, Dennis added, that provides a really exciting opportunity for a televised debate to differ from the norm. For the first time, the public is not only able to see and hear the discourse, they are also able to actively engage in the discussion and move it on themselves.
Informed by Design
When CNNs editorial team and engineers first visited the Thought Leadership Centre in early 2015, they were taken back by what the space afforded them both in terms of intimacy and technology, said Gill Penlington, director of news and event programming across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The seating, built into concentric circles, made the room feel warm and inclusive, even with high-tech gadgets at every desk. The politicians could be seated in the center with Amanpour, close to the audience. There would be no podiums or staging creating distance.
The iPads and the wall screen were motivators for making the debate as interactive as possible. In this video, CNN engineers explain how they customized the lighting and built an onsite control room. Once the votes were submitted, a graphics machine converted the data into images that appeared on the 360-degree screen, showing the results in real time.
If you were to do this in a different space and try and buy 150 iPads, and hook them up to a screen, building a system that feeds into it, you could actually do it, but it would be clunkier, said Penlington.
The debate included two types of digitally interactive questions. The first were prepared in advance. The editorial team knew there would be time for five or six key debate topics, so they drafted issue questions that would appear on every iPad and on the wall screen at the start of a new discussion. The questions had to be clear and understandable so audience members could vote yes, no, or no opinion within eight seconds.
As a viewer, said Penlington, you dont want to be watching something wheres theres a 30-second process.
Drawing on the results, Amanpour would guide the conversation with the panelists and occasionally ask for instant audience reaction to a point that was made. For these quick follow-ups, audience members could select either a thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon on the iPads.
In addition, CNN correspondent Max Foster worked the aisles, asking viewers how they voted and why, drawing out more nuance.
The combination worked well, said Penlington. The audience was engaged every few minutes, either electronically or by someone sharing more about which way they sided.
It was a bit of TV theater as well as a serious political debate, she said, adding that Amanpour had room within the format to ask follow-up questions and push the guests.
EU Membership Debated
Heres how that played out during a question on whether there should be a referendum on membership in the European Union. At the start of the discussion, Foster gave the audience these instructions: If you think we should have a referendum, its a smiley face. If you dont, then its a sad face. If you dont actually care, you can also vote for an indifferent face, so please vote.
The wall lit up with mostly smiley faces. Final tally: 57 percent in favor of referendum; 36 percent against; and 7 percent didnt care.
Foster approached an audience member and asked which way she voted.
The results of a vote on holding a EU referendum appear on the wall.
I went yes, do have a referendum, she said. I think its right the electorate gets to choose, rather than having it promised and never delivered. It would be interesting to see if the next party leading actually does follow through.
Foster turned to the man sitting next to her. Do you think we should have a choice, sir?
Yes.
There you go, said Foster, turning to Amanpour and the panelists. Two clear answers.
Well, that is pretty clear, said Amanpour, 57 percent want a choice.
The conversation among the panelistsConservative Pauline Neville-Jones, Liberal Democrat David Steel, Labours Chris Bryant, Humza Yousaf of the Scottish National Party (SNP), and Louise Bours of the UK Independence Party (UKIP)took off from there.
To think we that we havent since the 1970s had any kind of voice on this issue at all is incredible, said Bours, whose UKIP party is anti-EU. Were now pushing so people will have a say. Like the lady and the gentleman said over there, its absolutely vital that the electorate have a say in this.
Bours pressed the issue, criticizing the lack of legislative power in parliament. Neville-Jones fired back that if UKIP went to the European parliament and did its job, you would not be saying you are not part of the legislative process.
Labour Partys Bryant, who identified as passionately pro-European, cited economic interests and the political certainty the EU guaranteed against member countries reverting back to dictatorships.
He said there were more important things for the U.K. to focus on than a referendum; namely the low-wage economy. (During a different debate segment, when the audience was asked to select the issue most important to them, the economy topped the list with more than 54 percent of the vote, followed by health care, 22 percent; Europe, 13 percent; immigration, 7 percent; and foreign affairs, 3 percent.)
Steel, a Liberal Democrat, said he doesnt think theres a case for another referendum.
What Im worried about, he said, is the UKIP position is different from any of the other parties, that it seems to be based, particularly from your leader, on a hatred of foreigners.
Absolute rubbish, Bours interjected.
After the disaster of two world wars, coming together in Europe was a major political advance, and we should hang on to that, added Steel.
Amanpour asked the panelists to pause there. Weve had some claps. I want to get a vote from the audience, and then well come back to this issue, because it is actually quite fundamental.
So, quick vote, thumbs up, thumbs down: Do you want the U.K. to stay in the European Union? Thumbs up for yes, thumbs down for no.  
Music played, sounding like a game show when contestants submit their final answers. Columns of thumbs, three high, started appearing on the wall.
Thumbs up: 76 percent; thumbs down: 23 percent.
Thats pretty overwhelming. What do you say to that? asked Amanpour.
Thats fine, but theyve all had their say, said Bours. That is the point.
Lessons Learned
Even though including real-time feedback during a live debate was a novel idea, Penlington said it wasnt difficult to get the guests to agree to the format once CNN explained how it would use the available technology. Debate producers made clear that the intent was to engage the audience in a meaningful way, not to hold anyones position up for ridicule.
A studio audience member prepares to vote during a quick thumbs-up, thumb-down question.
I do think there was a degree of trust in the relationship there, said Penlington, adding that CNN wasnt about to risk damaging its brand by going for a cheap laugh. There was a mutual understanding on the part of the politicians that we were going to use it in a positive, enlightening, and democratically enhancing way.
All sides seemed pleased with the outcome, she said, noting that the company that screened individuals to ensure a balanced debate audience reported that participants said they felt included and energized.
The feedback from the panelists was good as well, said Penlington. They said it was interesting to see and literally to visualize what the audience was thinking at any given point. It just added another dimension to the discussion.
About 10 percent of the 130-member audience was asked for additional comments during the one-hour debate. Penlington said it was a good number. Hearing why people vote the way they do is part of what makes for an invigorating debateand good television.
The Thought Leadership Centre has a 150-seat capacity. A bigger venue would allow for more electronic votingwhich might create more accurate voting samples, assuming the audience is vetted for party affiliationbut Penlington said it would be difficult to include more follow-up with participants unless the debate time was increased or the format was altered.
If the voting took place online, involving many thousands, she said there would have to be assurances that the technology couldnt be hijacked by interest groups. Respected broadcasters cant risk passing off extreme voting swings on serious news issuessuch as 90 percent of people suddenly being against immigrationas credible or representative of public opinion.
Later in 2015, during a debate on climate change, CNN producers omitted the no-opinion, or neutral, option. The thinking, said Penlington, was that most people have a very strong view on climate change, so it would be OK to move to a binary vote.
What they learned instead is that people generally know where they stand on big issues like climate change, but they may not feel informed or passionate enough to weigh in on specifics, such as nuclear power or wind farms. So some people simply didnt vote , and when that happened, it appeared as a null or negative sign.  
We made a series of assumptions about the audience being happy with a binary choice, and as it turned out, some of them wanted to be able to express a more sophisticated opinion, so I think we ought to afford them the space to do that, said Penlington.
The next step is getting politicians at the highest levels of government to agree to take part in interactive debates. Penlington said that CNN is not only in position to lean on its reputation and the reputation of its anchors and producers, but it now has this debate to hold up as an example.
We got a cast of politicians on the panel who are well-regarded and well-known, said Penlington. These people are happy, it all went welltherefore, what do you think?

Life in Facebookistan: Microsoft researcher Tarleton Gillespie offers a near-exhaustive list of all the human decisions that go into the algorithms that make up Facebooks Trending Topics.


Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, one of several prominent right-wingers that met with Facebook brass Wednesday, writes on Medium that he was more upset with the behavior of his compatriots at that meeting than with company executives. He writes, in my opinion, there is no evidence of a top-down initiative [by Facebook management] to silence conservative voices. He also notes his consternation to hear fellow conservatives asking the company for what he calls affirmative action for conservatives.


In my opinion, conservatives upset with reports that Facebook may have been politically editing its Trending Topics have a deeper problem: the sites American user base tilts urban, young and female. So even if the site treated all content equally, it would tend to surface and highlight content that is more likely to engage urban, young and female Americans.


California saw a two-day jump of 200,000 new online voter registrations after Facebook posted a reminder to its California users at the tops of their news feeds this past Monday, the secretary of states office announced. One-third of the registrations were by voters aged 17-25, while another 29% were by 26-35 year-olds.

Civic Hack Day 2011 in Baltimore (Photo: Mark Headd)

In early 2012, I had the opportunity to present at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Conference in Austin, TX. The focus of my presentation was the lessons learned from two civic hacking events in late 2011 that I had helped organize in Philadelphia and Baltimore.
This was an exciting time for me professionally. After leaving government to become a professional software developer and technology evangelist in the early 2000s, I had been drawn back into the world of government a few years prior through the open data movement. By 2011, I was working regularly with budding civic tech communities in two different but geographically close cities. I was able to collaborate with groups of people who cared deeply about the future of their cities and who were committed to making a difference.
It was also an exciting time for civic techCode for America was launching its Brigade network at the 2012 SXSWi conference and while there I had a chance to meet and talk with Jen Pahlka, Tim OReilly, and Kevin Curry (who went on to build out the Code for America Brigade program and scale it nationally). I was so moved by Jens vision for civic tech that I ended up leaving my job with a telecommunications startup and joined Code for America myself a few short weeks after SXSWi ended.
Thinking back on this time, it strikes me that the experience of the two cities I got to talk about then can tell us a lot about what it takes to build and grow a civic tech community. I think its exciting that there are places where leaders have essentially figured out how to nurture and sustain civic tech. But I would argue that there are many places where this issue has not yet been resolved, and even some places where civic tech groups once flourished by have have since gone dormant.
Of interest to me personally, there are also a great many placesparticularly small and mid-sized citieswhere civic tech organizing has not yet begun.
Then and Now
In many ways, Baltimore and Philadelphia were in similar places from a civic tech perspective in 2011.
The City of Baltimore had just launched an official open data portal and was regularly publishing data to it. A series of small(ish) hackathons were organized and there seemed to be a growing dialogue between the local technology community and city government around data and civic technology.
At the same time, Philadelphia was in a similar place. The city had not yet adopted an open data policy or launched an official open data portal. Philly benefited from being one of the first cities to partner with Code for America and there seemed to be a growing acceptance inside city government for publishing data and generally supporting civic tech. Earlier that year, a local technology company called Azavea built and launched what would become the citys official open data portalOpen Data Philly.
And yet, if we look at these two cities today they appear to be in very different places with regard to civic tech. Philadelphia has a large and active civic tech community with strong connections to city governmentcity officials are regular participants in civic tech events, and a recent civic hacking event was kicked off from City Hall by the Mayor himself. This community has helped spawn some of the most innovative civic tech solutions in the country, like Councilmaticwhich has since gone on to be adopted in other cities like Chicago and New York.
Baltimore, however, doesnt have a clearly identifiable civic tech communitythough there have been efforts to create one. There are no regular meetups of people interested in working on civic issues, no regular events to bring the community together and grow it, no regular interactions between city officials and outside civic technologists. This is not because the city lacks passionate, talented people interested in working on civic tech. Far from it.
Baltimore has not been completely silent on the civic tech front since 2011. There have been a few eventslike Hack the Parksthat started to build up the relationship between city government and the technology community. These events were largely due to the efforts of people like Andrew Hazlett and Sharon Paley (now with the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University). But the organization behind these eventsthe Greater Baltimore Technology Councilis now defunct and no similar organization in Baltimore has moved to fill the role once played by the GBTC in leading civic tech organizing.
The Digital Harbor Foundation, under the leadership by Andrew Coynow at the White House, and one of the co-organizers of the civic hacking event in Baltimore I talked about at SXSW in 2012has developed some pioneering youth technology initiatives in Baltimore. But these efforts seem to operate in a different space from the one we typically expect a civic tech community to occupy. In fact, they seem almost ideally positioned to act as a feeder program for a larger civic tech effortbringing in young people with passion for their city and arming them with technical skills they can use to make a difference.
But that doesnt seem to be happening largely because of the absence in Baltimore of an organized civic tech community that we typically see in other cities. There isnt an organized community to feed these youngsters into thats focused on using technology for the public good in Baltimore.
Both cities have an abundance of factors that I think are critical in helping develop a healthy civic technology community. They both face some pretty significant challenges, have developing startup communities and are full of talented, passionate people that want to work to make their city better. They also both have governments that at least publish some open data and have a formal policy around releasing data.
But beyond simply publishing data, there is at least one factor that is differentthe level of involvement by city government in Philadelphia and Baltimore in their respective civic tech communities.
The Role of the City
Writing about his work in supporting Chi Hack Nightthe wildly successful and influential civic hacking meetup in the City of ChicagoChristopher Whitaker notes the important role played by city government in building the Chicago ecosystem:
A big part of why were able to have as much impact as we do is because we have built a civic innovation ecosystem...each of these different parts compliments the other. The City of Chicago provides the data that powers the engine. The Chi Hack Night provides a place for talent and collaboration. The Smart Chicago Collaborative provides institutional support.
Having city officials engaged and present at civic technology events is a key ingredient to their success, growth and longevity. As a former city official that was present at a lot of civic technology events in Philly my opinion on this issue is not unbiased. But this is a trend that is easy to spot in cities that have active civic tech communities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia.
And if I had to point to one single factor that has stymied the growth of an organized civic tech community in Baltimorea place with all of the other ingredients necessary for one to flourishI would point to a lack of active involvement and support from city government.
And if this is right, then I think there are some important lessons here for supporters of civic technology.
Lessons Learned
There are lots of places where the issue of organizing and sustaining civic technology has not yet been resolved.
Clearly there are places like Chicago where great strides have been made due to years of investment and institutional support. But there are many other places that have not yet started down the road of civic tech. And as is generally the case with support for open data, these places tend to be small and mid-sized cities that lack institutions like Smart Chicago to support nascent civic tech efforts.
The lessons from Philly and Baltimore also suggest that the progress we have seen in larger cities may be more fragile than we think it is. If direct and enthusiastic support from city government is essential to successfully organizing civic tech efforts, then what happens when that support goes away?
New York City, under Mayor Bill deBlasio, and Philadelphia, under new Mayor Jim Kenney, suggest that a commitment from city government to open data and engagement with the civic tech community can survive the transition from one administration to the next. But I think it makes sense to consider what happens to civic tech communities when this commitment doesnt survive that kind of transition, or evaporates for other reasons.
In Madison, Wisconsin, an enthusiastic and growing civic tech community has grown largely stagnant because of a lack of support from city government and hesitancy to release useful data. Derek Ederone of the organizer of Chi Hack Night in Chicagoin talking about the struggles in the civic tech community in Madison, has said. I think the government, especially the city, deserves a lot of credit for helping start the community [in Chicago].
Hes right, and we shouldnt forget this.
Far from being a resolved issue, civic tech organizing in many places is still in its infancy. Rather than declaring victory, our work should now be focused on institutionalizing things that support civic tech so we can help ensure it survives going forward.

Civic HackingCivic TechHackathon 







Last month one of the webs earliest political bloggers and activists won a primary race against an incumbent for a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Chris Rabb, who founded the influential email listserv Afro-Netizen in 1999 and is now an adjunct professor at Temple University, was able to apply his social media savvy and extensive network of connections to his campaign, and ultimately beat incumbent Tonyelle Cook-Artis by seven points, winning 47 percent of the vote to her 40 percent.
Although Cook-Artis was a freshman representativeshe had won the seat in a special election after her predecessor stepped down to join the Philadelphia City Councilshe had the support of all of the local elected officials, and observers at first thought that Rabb didnt stand a chance considering the political heavyweights supporting his rival.
But Rabb had other advantages. As he pointed out when he spoke to Civicist in December, just after declaring his run, Rabb had 4,200 Facebook friends to call on for support and for votes. As of May 19, his primary opponent, Cook-Artis, had fewer than 300 likes on her campaign page.
Rabb leveraged online tools, including the new crowdfunding platform Crowdpac, to raise money and awareness about his campaign, but he also tells Civicist that he knocked [on] countless doors in the dead of winter and spring.
Crowdpac was essential to his win because it allowed Rabb to raise money and gauge support before even entering the racewithout it he says he might never have entered at allbut he didnt skimp on face to face time.
My campaign was built on high touch and high tech, like a hand in a glove. Rabb told Civicist in an email. One complemented the other.
Rabb says that how his campaign uses social media is as important as the fact that he uses it at all:

For me, its all about telling a compelling and authentic narrative about me and the political moment were collectively experiencing. The power of story-telling is ancient and inextinguishable. Visual vignettes have served as proxies for such narratives. Photos of young people knocking on doors. My sons narrating a short web video talking about the values our family shares about public service overlaying moving imagery. These images arent pandering; theyre representative of values and priorities that were embraced as much in terms of how this campaign was run as the type of public servant I seek to be. Its been about walking the talk the whole way through.

Rabb says he will carry this methodology with him when he is elected in November (as the Democratic candidate in one of the most Democratic legislative districts in Pennsylvania, his win is virtually assured).
Technology is a toolkit, but its only as good as the values, skills, and vision of those who use it, he tells Civicist. Ultimately, technology must be used to broaden transparency, bolster accountability, measure impact, and facilitate social inclusion and equity. These are the cornerstones of public integrity, and productivity without integrity is meaningless.

Elections 





Americans are far more aware of the regulatory debate surrounding ride-hailing services than the one around home-sharing services, according to a new Pew Research poll out today. The poll shows that 72 percent of Americans say they have used a shared, collaborative or on-demand online service, although broadly defined this includes buying second-hand online, choosing same-day delivery, buying tickets from an online reseller, or working in a shared office space.


Speaking of the ride-hailing regulatory debate, Douglas OConnor, the key plaintiff in the recently-settled class-action lawsuit against Uber, has filed an objection to the settlement claiming he was left out of the mediation process and pressured into accepting, Caroline ODonovan reports for BuzzFeed.


New York City is testing a new way of building websites: rolling new features out slowly and asking for feedback along the way. Yesterday they launched alpha.nyc.gov, which right now only covers the three of the most popular website searches: Find a Job, Pay a Parking Ticket, and Get an IDNYC.


Smart Chicagos Daniel ONeil writes in his latest piece for Civicist that Chicago has figured out how to sustain civic tech organizing. But ONeil has some doubts as to whether these groups are worth sustaining.


Name and shame: Today the city of Toronto will vote on whether or not to institute a ratings system for landlords that would require them to display their score much like restaurants display grades. In advance of the vote, yesterday Rentlogic and the social justice advocacy group ACORN Canada launched LandlordWatch, which tracks the worst landlords in Toronto based on the number of violations on record. As Peter Kim noted in Global News, right now the worst landlord in the city is Toronto Community Housing.


Like podcasts? The Department of Better Technology has started a podcast called Rewiring Government, in which they will interview Presidential Innovation Fellows, Code for America fellows, and other govtech leaders. Episode one features DOBT CEO Joshua Goldstein in conversation with Justin Erlich, the Data and Technology Advisor to California Attorney General Kamala Harris, discussing the transparency initiative OpenJustice.


Life in Facebookistan: Zuckerberg has met with influential conservatives to try to allay their fears that Facebook has a liberal news bias, Ben Guarino reports for the Washington Post. But the bottom line is, as the Heritages Daily Signal editor-in-chief Robert Bluey told the Post, nobody is about to jump ship because the Facebook audience is too valuable to miss out on.


Writing in the New York Times, Zeynep Tufekci puts the Facebook debate in its place, arguing that the trending topics feature is trivial compared to the newsfeed, which is created algorithmicallyand therein lies the real Facebook bias, as she calls it.


Related: The Wall Street Journals Jon Keegan pulled together a visualization called Blue Feed, Red Feed that shows the different kind of posts that liberal and conservative publish on hot-button topics like Donald Trump, guns, ISIS, and Facebook.

First Post 



Chi Hack Night meetings are held in River North, one of the most affluent neighborhoods in Chicago. (Photo: Daniel ONeil)
After announcing their departure from OpenOakland, co-founders Eddie Tejeda and Steven Spiker spoke to Civicists Jessica McKenzie about their experience running a civic innovation organization and, in particular, the challenges of funding hack night-style organizations.
There isnt anyone thats figured this out yet, Spiker told Civicist. Like, this particular type of organizationthat we can telldoesnt exist anywhere in the U.S. thats been funded effectively and has any staff, anywhere. There are organizations that are starting to get small grants here and there, or small projects, but by and large theyre tiny and theres no one thats actually figured out what the model is.
At Smart Chicago, weve supported organizations like this for yearsboth successful groups and groups that havent lastedand we believe we have some insight. We think weve even figured out the model: early support through free meeting space, relevant project revenue, and documentation.
The question for me is whether these kinds of tech organizing groups are the model that should be supported.
Weve worked with many tech organizing groups that have long-term plans, including Data Potluck, a four-year hackathon series, and OpenStreetMap. Weve provided varying degrees of help, and the projects are still going in one form or another.
But the group to which weve provided the most support is what is now called Chi Hack Night. It can reasonably be described as the most successful speaker series devoted to civic tech anywhere in the country. The weekly meetings have been happening regularly since March 2012, and Chi Hack Nights success is based on the hard work of co-organizers Derek Eder and Christopher Whitaker, and, previously, that of co-founder Juan-Pablo Velez.
Smart Chicago has provided a goodly amount of support to Chi Hack Night, and I think that the hack night organizers actually have figured out how to sustain their work.
First, lets take a look at the support provided by Smart Chicago.
Free meeting space in a premier tech-oriented location
The opening of 1871 was a seminal event in the startup world here in Chicago. It was very difficult to get accepted to the inaugural class of companies. Smart Chicago was a founding member and we opened up seats there to the civic tech world for free. Derek, as a leader of Open City Apps, applied for free space and we gave it to him.
Heres what Derek had to say in his application to Smart Chicago for a seat at 1871 back in April 2012:
Open City is a group of volunteer entrepreneurs who create civic web apps that aim to improve transparency, efficiency, and decision-making in Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois.
Wed love to have a place at 1871 to promote the use of open data and to meet innovative people who want to improve the way their city and governments work.

It ended up that he started both his business (DataMade) and his weekly event (then-called OpenGov Hack Night) there from the first week.
After about 10 months, Derek and Data Made had attracted many clients and had enough revenue and mojo on their own that they became a tenant there in their own right, and paid for the event space through their own membership at 1871.
Revenue from relevant tech projects
Another form of early support we provided was contract work. We hired Derek Eder and his nascent software consulting firm to work on a number of projects for Smart Chicago: Connect Chicago, a map-based website showing public computer centers, Chicago Early Learning, a site about preschool options, and Chicago Health Atlas, a place where people can see citywide health data and take action near them. All of these projects are still going, supported by other technologists and consultants in the local scene.
We employed Christopher Whitaker for three yearspaying him for, among other projects, organizing at hack night. This kind of stabilitywhere all of your efforts, each hour of labor, are compensatedis a key way to sustain that effort. Whitaker did so much work in civic tech organizing for us that we published a book about it: The @CivicWhitaker Anthology. None of that was volunteerevery word, every scrap of effort, had an invoice associated with it, and he provided enormous value for it.
Based on support from foundations like the MacArthur Foundation, The Chicago Community Trust, as well as contracts like the ones we have with Cook County, we are able to employ many other people in the civic tech scene doing relevant work. Longtime hack night (and OpenGov Chicago(-land!) attendee and leader Josh Kalov has been doing Cook County Open Data work for two and a half years for us. He has worked on a couple of other projects as well, including one that re-uses code developed during a Code for America fellowship. Cathy Deng, an employee at DataMade and a hack night person, does expunge.io. Civic tech pioneer Scott Robbin used to run our Amazon Web Services accounts. Sandor Weiss, formerly a colleague of mine at EveryBlock, made Chicago Works For You.
This is real money used for real projects that benefit the residents of Chicago and Cook County and help build the scene.

Promotion and documentation
Lastly, Smart Chicago supported Chi Hack Night with promotion (live tweets, mainly) and documentation (hundreds of hours of video, dozens of blog posts, and the incessant energy of Christopher Whitaker. Having this kind of outbound prove-up, week-in, week-out, is invaluable.
Download The @CivicWhitaker Anthology here:
 
 The @CivicWhitaker Anthology  from Smart Chicago Collaborative
Sustained for years and going strong
Nowadays, the people who run Chi Hack Night, the premier event of its kind, dont need Smart Chicago at all to do their work.
Derek and his partner have built Data Made into a thriving business that is at the center of Hack Night. They havent needed free office space, free event space, or even project work from Smart Chicago for years now. Theyve attracted many other sponsors with their consistently high quality speakers and crowds of people who want to hear them.
Christopher left as a consultant last September, and is now employed with Code for America as Brigade Program Manager, where he helps develop tech organizing capacity across the country.

Beyond sustainability for civic tech
In fact, Smart Chicago has essentially stopped supporting civic tech organizing infrastructure. We find more value in supporting community technology through programs like Connect Chicago, Youth-Led Tech, Smart Health Centers, and Documenters.
When it comes to convening people around technology for good, we tend to focus on adding resident voices to Internet of Things projects, recording meetings about police accountability in neighborhoods beyond downtown, and meeting in small groups with people from all over the county.
Smart Chicagos focus is on the unmet technology organizing needs in neighborhoods all over the city.
Sustainability of civic tech organizing is basically resolved in Chicago. What remains is a city of 2.7 people million with precious few invitations to range beyond their own block, very few jobs in tech for people with low to medium digital skills, and very few ways to listen and hear the needs of the people.
Thats what we need to build.
Daniel X. ONeil is Executive Director of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, a civic organization devoted to making lives better in Chicago through technology. Prior to Smart Chicago, ONeil was a co-founder of EveryBlock, where he was responsible for uncovering new data sets through online research and working with local governments.

There are two camps of tech-and-social-impact groups, Tom Steinberg writes in his latest Civicist piece: those that promote the public good through innovation and digital technologies, or promoters, and those that try to reduce the harmful impact of new technologies, or mitigators. Although they rose in tandem over the past two decades, Steinberg argues that in our post-Snowden, drone-filled world, the mitigators have all the momentum while the promoters lose steam.


In a world where digital technology reigns supreme, freedom of speech should not depend on the whims of a few powerful corporations and government rules, Dan Gillmor writes in Civicist. Increasingly, it does. With his mitigator cap firmly on, Gillmor argues that the centralization of internet powers is the biggest threat to the internetto progress evenand calls upon government, foundations, and individuals to fight it: Government, to promote better policies that encourage decentralization; foundations, to address market failures that threaten the common good; and individuals, to invest in solutions if theyre wealthy, or to change their habits if they arent.


Gillmor singles out Facebook as one of the worst of the centralizers, but his disgust for the platform is nothing compared that of internet activist Hossein Derakhshan (who spend six years in an Iranian prison for said activism), who wrote for the International Business Times last week that, contrary to Zuckerbergs preferred narrative that Facebook connecting us all, it has in reality destroyed the open web. Not only does Facebook prioritise native content in its newsfeeds, but it is introducing ideas such as Instant Articles or Live to bring all the content scattered around on distant corners of the web onto its own platform. Zuckerbergs vision is not to connect people in distant islands, but to bring everyone onto a big island so nobody would ever need to use a bridge to go anywhere else, Derakhshan writes. For me, as someone who spent six years in prison at a time when being online was a serious and intellectual activity, it is heart-breaking to see how Facebook has changed the internet into little more than a portal for entertainment.


Threats as far as the eye can see: Manuel Ortega argues for El Correo de las Indias that the block that the blockchain threatens the distributed future of the internet.


Glenn Greenwald writes that The Intercept is broadening access to the Snowden archive, first by gradually publishing nearly a decade of internal NSA newsletters, starting with those from 2003, and second, by making the full archive of materials available to outside journalists, including foreign journalists.


Google has hired four artists as part of the Data Center Mural Project to paint representations of the heart of the internet on the walls that encase it, Selena Larson reports for Daily Dot.


After finding that the ProPublica Prescriber Checkup database was potentially being misused by opioid abusers, ProPublica published an editorial about their suspicious and added warning labels on the pages for narcotic drugs, Erica Berry reports for the Columbia Journalism Review. But they didnt take the information down, a decision Berry writes has been celebrated by journalists on social media.


Were a bit late to this but its worth mentioning nonetheless: The neighborhood-based social media company Nextdoor has responded to critics and instituted changes meant to discourage racial fearmongering, Nanette Asimov reports for the San Francisco Chronicle.


As venture capitalists lose interest in mere growth and start demanding profit, on-demand companies contort the truth to get there, Ellen Huet reports for Bloomberg.

First Post 







A couple of years ago, a thoughtful technologist I was talking to said something that has really stuck with me:
You know, Im not actually sure that, over time, the internet will be viewed as a net-net good thing for the world.

I love how this simple statement captures the uncertainty of a person who is fully aware that the digital age has brought extraordinary dishes to the restaurant-table of humanity, but who is nervous both that the menu doesnt appear to contain any prices, and the server is being alarmingly vague about what payment methods will be accepted at the end of the night.
Ive been thinking about the pros and cons implied in this quote a lot recently. Doing so, it has occurred to me that while most thoughtful people can easily hold elements of optimism and caution in their heads at the same time, most social-impact organizations cannot, constitutionally, be so even-handed.
The pressures innate to social-impact organizations of any kind mean that they cannot adopt positions that are too ambiguous. After all, who would march under the banner On the one hand, X, on the other hand, maybe not X?
The tech scene is not immune to this pressure, and so over the last two decades organizations have self-sorted themselves into two broad camps. The first camp contains those organizations which are primarily concerned with mitigating harmful consequences of modern technologies. The second camp contains organizations that exist to try to solve problems and promote welfare through methods that use digital technologies. Ill call these two camps the mitigators and the promoters.
There are a lot of good organizations and familiar names in both camps. The most famous in the mitigators would be the Electronic Frontier Foundation, but theres also the Chaos Computer Club, the Open Rights Group, and the red-hot new research institute Data & Society. In the promoters camp the biggest name would undoubtedly be the Wikimedia Foundation, followed by Mozilla, and then a thousand other organizations, including my own alma mater mySociety. Furthermore, if you watch the excellent Silicon Valley TV series, youll know theres an argument to be made for putting more or less all modern startups in the promoters camp, allegedly out to make the world a better place. Theres also a case for putting Obama for America in the promoters camp, and all of ICT4Dthat is, tech for international development.
For much of the last two decades tech-and-social-impact promoters and mitigators rose in lockstep, with a simultaneous blooming of organizations in both camps, often connected by people who had feet in both worlds. There are and were many cross-friendships and relationships.
Now, the balance is shifting, and I believe that we are heading towards an era in which the mitigation camp grows rapidly and where the promotion camp withers somewhat. There is only so much energy, talent, money, and media attention out there, and to my beady eye it definitely feels like the tide has turned towards mitigation for the last three years or so.
Its pretty obvious why the mitigation camp would be growing. From Snowden to Trump, from drones to trolls, the digital world is giving us an immense number of reasons to be nervous, and a huge number of reasons to justify investment in research and activism. On the other hand, the promoters suffer from sitting alongside hugely successful private-sector digital businesses, and the miraculous products they give away, normally for free. They appear relatively small, and appear to be shrinkingWikipedia traffic is down year after year; nobody expects Mozilla to be bigger in the future than it was in the past. And what was the last free and open data standard to really shape a whole product market? Probably podcasts, technically formalized in about the year 2000.
I dont fully know what to think about the shift towards mitigators. They clearly, self-evidently deserve immense support and resourcesregulating the internet giants is obviously going to be one of the big governmental projects of the 21st century, and reaching a new social contract with our security services is needed, too. Those two jobs are going to take at least fifty years and will consume entire careers.
I guess Im just a little bit sad that after growing up in a world that was so excited about Linux, Wikipedia, TCP/IP, and other free and open public interest technologies of real scale, that the next phase of public interest development is going to be left primarily to the private sector. Or maybe thats just the perspective of someone who lives in a country of permanent austeritymaybe in a few years well just be able to import a world of good new public interest technologies from Canada or somewhere. Anyway, regardless of how I feel about it, the wind has definitely changed directions, so wed all better set our sails accordingly.

In a world where digital technology reigns supreme, freedom of speech should not depend on the whims of a few powerful corporations and government rules. Increasingly, it does.
A delegation of right-wing activists will travel this week to Silicon Valley. They will be supplicants at the throne of Facebook, a platform so pervasive that it has unprecedented power to decide whats newsa platform that could consume journalism itself in coming years. They will be begging Mark Zuckerberg for his indulgence. What they should be doingwhat we all should be doingis finding ways to reduce his companys dominance.
The promise of the internet and personal technology was in its decentralization: one of the most profound advances for liberty in history. Yet at a rapid rate were seeing it re-centralized, as governments and corporationsoften with users willing, if short-sighted, cooperationare taking control in the center, creating choke points over what we say and how we can say it.
The Facebook situation is helping people, including journalists, see that these choke points are a threat to freedom of expression. For countless millions, Facebook is the new public square. But its terms of service override the First Amendment, as activists and others have discovered. To assemble and speak in the new public square, we need permission from its owner.
Facebook is only one of those choke pointstelecoms, giant technology companies, payment systems, and, of course, governments are among the others. Freedom of expression is only one of the liberties at riskif youre being spied on, by companies and governments, your freedom to assemble in common cause is limited.
Progress itself is at stake. Because information is the core of invention in a world where software, microprocessors, and networks are becoming part of everything we touch, the freedom to innovate itself should not depend on the commercial and political wishes of powerful governments and corporations. Increasingly, it does.
One might argue that this is just how markets work: a normal re-centralization and rule-making after messy growth. Id argue that it represents market failure, because monopolies and oligopolies are the enemy of innovation.
The centralized powers are not going to give up their growing control willingly. We have to take it back. But we need help.
We need help from government: policies that push competition, rather than encourage monopolies and cartels. Specifically, the antitrust authorities need to be looking hardfrom appearances theyre not looking at allat the owners of these choke points.
We also need help from foundations: philanthropic organizations that exist, in some key ways, to address market failures that threaten the common good. A few foundations have made tentative steps into this arena, but their efforts have been timid, at best.
They need to do more. I wish I could persuade them to see this as a disaster for our collective future. I wish they would get together and pool several billion dollars to support initiativesincluding government policiesdesigned to help re-decentralize our technology and communications.
If they wont step up, we need wealthy individuals who recognize the threats to speech, innovation, and liberty itself inherent in centralized control. Perhaps a few of the newly minted Silicon Valley billionairesmany of whom accumulated their wealth by being part of the re-centralizationcould recognize what theyve done and lead the way out of the situation they helped create.
Weyou and Iare part of the solution, too. Unless we recognize whats at stake, and think about changing our own habits, were part of the problem. Unless we advocate for liberty, were helping the control freaks win. Well need to do things individually, and as members of communities at all levels, to change the trajectory.
This truly is an emergency. Lets hope its not too late to do something about it.

Brave new world: A government survey of 41,000 U.S. households finds that privacy concerns have stopped nearly half from doing basic things online like posting to social networks, Andrea Peterson reports for the Washington Post.


Starting today, relatively non-wealthy investors can risk anywhere from $2,000 to $100,000 of their own money in start-ups using online platforms to crowdfund themselves, Stacy Cowley reports for the New York Times.


Tech and politics: Writing for Civicist, contributing editor An Xiao Mina takes an in-depth look at how the presidential candidates are using social media to reach voters for whom English is not their first language. She writes, this may be the first presidential campaign to see a candidate post on social media not just in Spanish but Arabic, Hindi, and Vietnamese.

So tweeted Donald Trump less than two days after becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), wrote in the New York Times, Were going back to the day when politicians thought all they had to do was eat a taco or wear a sombrero to win our vote. Really? This is 2016 and those days are long gone.
80,000 retweets and an avalanche of responses later, it was clear that Donald Trumps lunch had left a bad taste in many peoples mouths:



Hillary Clinton wasted no time pointing out the oddness of Trumps tweet:
I love Hispanics! Trump, 52 minutes ago https://t.co/b9mv7nUduN
 Theyre gonna be deported. Trump, yesterday https://t.co/HzFWUT1XFl
 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 5, 2016

Clinton, however, has also had her share of social media slip-ups, including her sometimes-clumsy outreach to Latinos and Spanish speakers. She isnt afraid to talk about the importance of el respeto (especially when it comes to women) is one of seven things Hillary Clinton professes to have in common with your abuela, or grandmother, according to this December post on her campaign website. Though Clinton had been campaigning as a grandmother, the sentiment and cultural specificity of the particular Spanish word abuela didnt ring true with many people on social media.
People online responded with the hashtag #NotMyAbuela, which, as Katie Rogers of the New York Times noted, emerged as a critique of what some saw as a tone-deaf move to pander to a powerful but marginalized bloc of voters. Her critics pointed out that Mrs. Clinton did not grow up poor like their relatives, and was not separated from loved ones by country borders.

Mrs @HillaryClinton you are #NotMyAbuela. My abuela had to come to NY in search for a job without speaking English.

The Sanders teams language has also been poked at online. After he tweeted a series of multilingual campaign posters online, declaring that the United States is a better country without racism, some people took the opportunity to correct his grammar:


The nation is significantly more diverse than even eight years ago, when the U.S. elected a president with multicultural family ties, and this election season we have seen an unprecedented amount of outreach to communities of color and immigrants. Multilingual, cross-cultural outreach is not easy, and as candidates try to reach a more diverse constituency, their efforts sometimes falter, like above, and sometimes they are more effective, as well see below.
How much are online attempts from Clinton and Sanders really appealing to large sectors of American voters, including people of color, immigrants, and non-native English speakers? In our work at Meedan, a social technology company building digital tools for journalists, the authors of this article have been exploring multilingual conversations online about major world events. Given the prominence of conversations around language and immigration in the elections, the conversations arising during U.S. presidential elections have been particularly interesting to follow.
Indeed, language has played a role in both parties primaries. On the Republican side, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have conducted interviews in Spanish, and Ted Cruz, while not fluent in the language, has launched ads in Spanish. It was on the Republican stage where this elections first live exchange in Spanish occurred on a televised primary debate stage.
But with social media essential to contemporary campaigns, this may be the first presidential campaign to see a candidate post on social media not just in Spanish but Arabic, Hindi, and Vietnamese. That activity has been happening largely on the Democratic Party side. The Trump taco aside, this article focuses on Democratic candidates multilingual digital strategies, as they regularly post in Spanish and sometimes other languages. That is groundbreaking in itself, but, we argue, more work needs to be done to demonstrate true linguistic (and, by extension, cultural) inclusivity.
How language unites online
Both Clinton and Sanders regularly tweet in Spanish, and both are apt to retweet someone elses Spanish words and articles. Clinton and Sanders both maintain Spanish-language versions of their websites. While neither speak Spanish fluently, they have hired diverse staffboth teams are made up of about 33 percent people of colorand they have appointed prominent advocates like Lorella Praeli and Arturo Carmona to lead their Latino outreach.
The strategy makes sense: with 41 million native Spanish speakers (11.6 million of whom are bilingual), the United States is now the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world, bested only by Mexico. More broadly, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that American families speak more than 350 languages in the home. And while many people who speak a non-English language at home are also fluent in English, we clearly live in a linguistically diverse country.
There are obviously many Latinos who are bilingual, said Erika Andiola, Latino Press Secretary for the Sanders campaign, in an interview about their online language strategy. But its also a message to make sure our community knows we care about the community. The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for an interview, but her campaign site does provide a variety of information in Spanish. That said, the Sanders site features a button for en espanol much more prominently (the Clinton sites is hidden within a menu), and the Sanders Spanish language site offers more parallel content with the English site, though neither offer perfect 1 to 1 coverage.
Andiola also pointed out the Spanish version of FeelTheBern.org is run by volunteersnot officially part of the campaign. This site is, perhaps, reflective of the larger differences between the two campaigns: where Clinton is known for running a tight ship with committed volunteers, Sanders has innovated in empowering volunteers to act on their behalf. As Charles Lenchner, co-founder of People for Bernie and former activist with the Occupy Movement, puts it the agent of change is not Sanders, but those in the streets demanding his platform.
Another key difference in the candidates digital strategies is even more pronounced: the Sanders campaign has made significant efforts to do outreach in languages other than Spanish and English. The Sanders teams #AmericaTogether hashtag accompanied a series of tweets featuring multilingual messages in an extraordinary number of languages: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.
The hashtag was meant to be a call to action. Providing multilingual tweets for supporters to copy and paste, the campaign team said they wanted to show as many on-the-fence voters that taking part in the democratic process is a powerful way to break through the hate-filled barriers that often divide so many of us. Responses varied; some replied with edits, while others thanked Sanders and pledged support:


 With social media such a new component of campaigns today, it is probably safe to assert that Sanders is the first leading candidate to post in so many languages. But the multilingual tweets were arguably more of a symbolic gesture than a push for true inclusion.
Its obvious that the audience here it not people who speak the languages on the list as primary languages, noted Cayden Mak, Chief Technology Officer at 18 Million Rising, an Asian American advocacy group. Mak has written previously for Civicist about the importance of going beyond translation in promoting electoral access.
More than a hashtag: #AmericaTogether and Sanders Arab American outreach
Sanderss multilingual efforts on Twitter came shortly before his sweeping victory in Dearborn, MI, a city with one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country. A hashtag may be a symbolic gesture, but in a diverse country, diverse outreach sends an important signal: you are part of this country, too. His Arabic language outreach seemed especially significant, given that the language is a particular target for xenophobia in the United States (as exemplified by a recent incident of an Arabic speaker on an airplane being abruptly kicked off).
Sanderss outreach to Arab American communities in Michigan seemed to help, but it required much more than social mediaas with any aspect of a campaign, outreach in other languages requires a mosaic of efforts. Khaled Beydoun, a journalist and law professor from Detroit, wrote about the significance of this outreach:
Sanders simply had to deliver and spread that message, and make it accessible to segments of the community limited by language and confined by poverty. The Arab American News, headed by Osama Siblani, extended Sanders message into these and other segments of the community, with a vital endorsement of the candidate four days before the primary.
Beydoun connected the online with the offline, discussing the efforts of Bernie Sanders prior to the Michigan primary, where he won 67 percent of the vote. As Beydoun noted, the Sanders campaign issued Arabic print and radio ads leading up to the Michigan primary. He then met with community leaders and youth, and addressed the Arab American community in the heart of the community. Through several mediums, and finally on the ground, Sanders tailored his message to Arab and Muslim Americans. Intimately, genuinely, and directly.
Following Michigan, Beydoun told Civicist, Sanders has realized the importance of Arab and Muslim American support. For instance, he brought on Linda Sarsour [Executive Director of the Arab American Association of New York] as an official campaign surrogate, who addressed the audience and opened for Bernie in Wisconsin. He also recruited Amer Zahr, a prominent Arab American activist [and comedian], to assist with the campaign. This highlights that Sanders is keen on mobilizing Arab American support, and delivering his message in our communities.
The Clinton campaigns efforts, by contrast, were not as holistic. Bill Clinton was in Dearborn days before the Michigan primary, noted NYU law Danya Reda, an assistant professor at Peking University School of Transnational law, where she covers the legal process and Islamic law. However, he did not go into a single Arab-owned business or campaign in the Arab parts of town.
Sanderss campaign seems to have taken an interest in the Arab (and Muslim) communities and that interest has been noticed! Reda reflected. Ive heard from a lot of people who heard the Arabic-language [radio] spots in Michigan. Almost everyone I know has posted or shared the Arabic-language print messages from the campaign. And I know organizers who feel this has been influential.
The robustness of the Sanders campaigns outreach to Dearborn after its multilingual push online is an important reminder that digital outreach is only one part of the larger picture: candidates build trust in diverse communities through careful cultivation of community leaders and demonstrated commitment to communities priorities. Any hearty social media campaign in a language must be met with a hearty campaign on other media and a stronger ground game.
Despite the widespread negative attention with #NotMyAbuela and other hashtags like #Hispandering, Clintons team continues to tweet regularly in Spanish, garnering high engagement numbers (though not all of that engagement is positive). She received 63 percent of Latino votes in the recent New York primaries, and Latino voters overall seem to be leaning toward Clinton. As Priscilla Alvarez noted recently in the Atlantic:
Theres not a lot of light between their current positions, but beyond their stock responses lies a fundamental difference in how the two presidential candidates approach the Latino electorate: Clinton appears to prioritize immigration narratives, whereas Sanders pitches his plan for economic equality.

That said, a growing generation gap also reflects different modes of media and information access. As the Los Angeles Timess Kate Linthicum noted, younger Latinos who back Sanders say they are drawn to him because he dreams big, and theyre often learning about and advocating for him via online activism and universities.
Multilingual outreach online: Were just getting started
Two trends are increasingly intersecting: the United States electorate is becoming vastly more diverse, and social media and digital outreach are becoming critical to campaign success and innovation as more citizens turn to social media for election news. Language has emerged as a key part of Democratic candidates social media strategies and has played an increasing role in Republicans communication strategies. Regardless of the outcome of the primaries and the general elections, one legacy of the 2016 elections will likely be candidates open embrace of multilingual outreach online, from Spanish to Arabic to numerous other languages.
Language, of course, is not a new issue in electoral politics. As the Department of Justice explains of Section 203 of the Voting Act, which aims to protect the voting rights of minority language citizens, Congress has mandated minority language ballots and election support in some jurisdictions since 1975. The Voting Information Project by Google and the Pew Charitable Trusts has aimed to bolster those efforts with mobile-optimized tools in web, native app and SMS forms. (Full disclosure: Meedan is a member of the First Draft Coalition, which is part of Google News Lab.) But while access to election materials is critical, so is access to candidates themselves. Ethnic mediatelevision, radio, newspaperscan help significantly in getting the word out from candidates, and so can social media.
Best practices for multilingual political outreach on social media are just emerging, and all candidates efforts in these elections leave a lot to be desired. Social media is hailed as a direct line to candidates and their viewpoints, but that access is limited largely to English speakers. Even when a candidate does post frequently in Spanish and other languages, they include only a select number of posts. Further, those posts appear largely on Twitter and Facebook, which are not necessarily popular online platforms for minority language voters, who might prefer WhatsApp, WeChat, and other spaces.
Looking forward, we have a few thoughts for campaigns thinking seriously about multiple languages in their social media strategy:
1. Remember that language is both culture and words.
Speaking to #NotMyAbuela, Melisa Garcia, a graduate researcher at the University of New Mexico (and one of Meedans volunteer translators), noted, Interestingly, the use of Spanish here is a cultural one. Its portrayal and access via Twitter and other social media platforms honestly did not work for Clinton and ended up pushing away her Hispanic/Latino vote. In other words, while the word abuela made literal sense by meaning grandmother, the cultural and emotional context of the word caused a disconnect amongst Spanish speakers. Clinton may be a grandmother, but shes not a grandmother of Latina heritage.
As far as the Sanders campaign, Garcia added, I did notice that his approach to Hispanic/Latino voters has not had the same complexities. I think his use of Spanish on Twitter has been a lot more subtle, and he has used Spanish to simply communicate and reach out to Hispanic/Latino voters.
2. Make translators more visible.
On a related note, none of the current leading candidatesTrump, Clinton, and Sandersspeak Spanish, and it wouldnt be reasonable to expect them to speak the hundreds of other languages the U.S. electorate speaks. Everyone knows this years leading candidates are monolingual, and yet its not clear whos tweeting on their behalf on social media in other languages. This often matters because dialect and word choice reflect a positionality that the candidates just dont have. Knowing whos speaking on behalf of their candidate online can go a long way in building trust and credibility.
3. Consider multiple social media accounts.
We live in a world where both the Pope and the Kremlin tweet with dedicated Twitter accounts for each language (and, yes, the Pope tweets in Latin). Presidential candidates who are eager to reach across languages on social media should do the same. For monolingual speakers, seeing feeds in two languages can be distracting. Certainly, its a powerful gesture to show constituents that you are engaging across languages, but wed argue that the benefits of a long term, dedicated commitment to a language community can be even more powerful.
4. Empower your electorate online to engage across languages.
Sanders and Clinton have both taken to retweeting their supporters, including in other languages. This small gesture gets to a larger point: candidates can and should do more to empower their supporters to represent them in other languages. The Sanders campaigns efforts with the Arab American community is perhaps an exemplar in this regard: successful movements are built on peoples enthusiasm, sense of welcome into the campaign, and community of supporters.
5. Start earlier and build the networks.
Mainstream media, Melisa Garcia noted, has not fully allowed for the Sanders campaign to completely flourish, but the smaller groups of people that are looking to represent him have. Perhaps the broader Sanders campaign strategy of empowering volunteers points at a larger issue: that empowerment needs to start earlier. The passion behind his campaign can and should be matched by a stronger relationship with diverse, multilingual volunteers, especially tech-savvy youth.
Towards a Polyglot Democracy
California, the primary with the largest number of delegates, is little over a month away, and with it, the countrys largest number of Latino voters will be going to the ballots. With Trumps nomination all but locked in, all eyes will be on Democratic voters decision in the primaries. The state is also the countrys most diverse, and polls suggest that Clinton and Sanders are evenly split in terms of Latino support in California.
California outpaces the larger national trend: our increasingly diverse country needs increasingly diverse campaigns. Twitters multilingual I voted hashtags will no doubt be used liberally, especially by digitally-savvy youth amongst whom Sanders has greater resonance. Clinton and Sanders in 2016 and any future Presidential candidates in 2020 and beyond would do well to think more robustly about a multilingual outreach strategy in a state where ballots come in seven languages and in a country where ballots come in any more.
True language access requires a commitment to organizing by design, wrote Cayden Mak in a previous Civicist piece on our increasingly polyglot democracy. Mak was speaking about citizen organizing, but his words could just as well apply to campaign organizing design: in future campaigns, we can expect even broader multilingual and multicultural outreach onlineand, no doubt, the mocking hashtags and corrections that go with them.

First Post 



Microsoft Pulse poll results appear behind candidates for New Yorks 13th Congressional District. / Photo: Silicon Harlem
 
Last month, seven candidates took part in a primary debate organized by Silicon Harlem focused on technology innovation and access issues affecting New Yorks 13th Congressional District. The subject matter alone would have made it novel, but the two-hour event stood out for other reasons.

For starters, the seat doesnt open up very often. Outgoing Rep. Charles Rangel has been in office for more than 45 years, and before him, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., held the seat for more than a quarter-century (the district number and borders changed several times during their tenures). If history is any guide, this could be the only turnover many voters witness in their lifetime.
So it was perhaps no surprise that around 600 people crowded into the event space MIST Harlem to hear what the Democratic candidates had to say about how technology can support education and economic development.
Yet the attendees did more than listen: Using Pulse, Microsofts audience engagement platform, some of them (more on the limitations later) could indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the speakers and respond to instant polls related to debate topics. Those watching the live stream could also take part.
In short, they used the same technology Microsoft has made available during presidential primary debates to gauge audience responses, making this the first local debate to offer that level of engagement. And, in an unusual move for a political debate, the feedback appeared in real-time on a screen behind the candidates, for everyone in the room to see.
It was a historic evening, said Clayton Banks, co-founder of Silicon Harlem, referring to the many firsts that night.
Rangels retirement presents the opportunity for the district to select a candidate who is not only tech-oriented, but who understands the impact on housing, business, and other aspects of community development. Civic tech advocates are attempting to make the most of it.
At most times, even on the presidential level, they dont talk about technology and innovation and how that relates to our 21st-century economy, said Banks. I cant see anything more important, but for whatever reason, thats getting left out of the dialogue.
Not on this night.
The debate was designed around how to use innovation to encourage the growth of green, tech-forward communities. Most of the candidates came prepared with specific ideas and strong opinions about improving broadband access, increasing access to STEM programs, and regulating start-up companies such as Uber.
There wasnt much back-and-forth between the moderators and the candidatesdue to there being seven candidates at the tableand there was little disagreement on most issues, including the importance of innovation and the need for New York Citys internet providers to deliver the services theyre contracted to provide.  
Still, some differences emerged. Former state Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV, the son of the storied congressman who was defeated by Rangel in 1970, repeatedly stressed the need for every kid to own an iPad, arguing that access to more tools would bridge the digital divide.
It wont mean a thing if you aint got that thing, said Powell.
Others put more emphasis on after-school programs and early education.
By fifth grade, its not a divide. At that point its a chasm, and you cant catch up, said Suzan Johnson Cook, a former ambassador-at-large for International Religious Freedom.
New Yorks 13th Congressional Districtthe countrys smallest and most dense, with more than 700,000 peopleshifted before the last election cycle. The predominantly Hispanic district now encompasses upper Manhattan and a small slice of the Bronx, including the neighborhoods of Harlem, Inwood, Marble Hill, Spanish Harlem, Washington Heights, and portions of Morningside Heights and the Upper West Side.
The districts bilingual workforce should be considered an asset in attracting more jobs to the area, said candidate Mike Gallagher, a former business executive with a computer background, when asked to name whats good about the district for the development of technology.
Capturing Nuance and Depth
MSNBC anchor Richard Lui moderated the debate with Jamil Smith, MTV News senior correspondent, Israel Ortega, a senior writer at Opportunity Lives, and Carrie Sheffield, founder of the new media startup Bold. The ground rules were familiar: two minutes for opening remarks, one minute for responses, and 30-seconds for rebuttals.  
The debate was also seen as an opportunity to encourage civic engagement. Rangel has encountered close primaries in recent years, but hes won general elections with around 75 percent of the vote, and constituents have grown accustomed to the status quo. Banks said hed like to see increased voter turnout this yeara likely scenario given the presidential election and the open congressional seat.

Silicon Harlem, which opened in 2013 with the mission of transforming Harlem into a technology and innovation hub, has previously worked with Microsofts technology and civic engagement team in New York and sought the companys involvement in the debate. Pulse turned out to be a good fit and met the needs for audience engagement.
The interactive platform, which first launched in 2013, has been used for conferences and higher education, along with much bigger political events, including presidential primary debates hosted by CNN and Telemundo and a Labour Party leaders debate in the U.K. CNN also used it during President Obamas ISIS speech and, along with MSNBC, during the 2015 State of the Union address.
The platform is still evolving: Microsoft released Video Pulse, a version for collecting feedback on top of recorded video, during the 2016 National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show in April.
The Silicon Harlem debate marked the first time Pulse was employed during a local, non-televised debate. It can be set up for any size event, making it a viable option for political and civic debates, including school boards.
At the start of the event, Lee Brenner, who heads business development and partnerships for Microsofts Technology and Civic Engagement team in Washington, D.C., spoke briefly about the companys efforts to empower citizens and communities. He then encouraged the audience members to take out their phones and go to a dedicated URL, siliconharlem.net/pulse.
Once there, participants could select their gender, party affiliation, and whether they were viewing the debate in person or watching the livestream. Information could be filtered using those parameters at any time during the debate.
Microsoft Pulse runs continuously, offering real-time voting to gauge whether audience members agree, disagree, or are neutral about what the candidates are saying at that moment. Responses can be registered every five seconds. The results create a worm-like effect on the screen, as a line curves up and down depending on audience members reactions. This sentient analysis shows how people are feeling throughout the event while optional survey questions invite more reflection on issues.
There are advantages to the two-sided approach, Brenner later told Civicist. One is a little bit more nuanced; the other gives you more depth.  
Brenner said hes surprised more debates havent given voters opportunity to take part, given the technology available. But he sees that changing.
I think the more pressure that we have, the more demand that there is, he said. And citizens are more engaged anyway in their everyday lives. Any debate, local or national, will have to integrate technology in some way.
New Set-Up, Old Problem
Silicon Harlem inputted 10 survey questions ahead of the debate related to local issues the candidates would be discussing. The questions appeared periodically on Pulse, with polling staying open for several minutes each time.
One of the yes/no questions asked whether the cost of internet access is prohibitive; 30 percent said yes. On how to get more girls and women into STEM careers, almost two-thirds of respondents selected provide more after-school, summer, and weekend STEM programs out of five multiple choice options.

It was difficult to determine how well the responses represented the audience, however, because of connectivity problems in the room. As candidates were responding to Luis first question asking what could be done to bridge the digital divide, Lui reminded audience members to go to siliconharlem.net/pulse. Some people shouted in response that the wi-fi was down, preventing them from getting online.
Digital divide in Harlem, sighed Assemblyman Keith Wright, prompting groans and laughter. (Wright has since secured Rangels endorsement.)
The biggest issue with successful audience engagement is adequate bandwidth, and on that night, it wasnt adequate.
Even though we sort of had a laugh about it, the point is, this is how important this issue is, said Banks, noting that if the broadband was working appropriately, hundreds of people could have participated simultaneously instead of 40 or 50 people at a time. It shows how important it is that your infrastructure is strong, how important it is to have ubiquitous broadband, and how important it is to bridge the digital divide.
Janet Charles, an attorney in New York who attended the debate, said she was able to get on after a delay. Though it was her first time engaging online during a political event, she had used a similar platform during a legal conference and was pleased to see it offered.
Its appropriate to use technology to participate, she said, especially given the focus of the Silicon Harlem debate. She added that while its essential to increase educational opportunities around technology for students in the district, the capacity issues were a reminder of how crucial it is to have reliable, high-speed internet.
A Role in the Conversation
Twitter and Facebook conversations are pulled into Pulse, so everything can be viewed in one place. The debate topics that night sparked a lively Twitter conversation under #shdebate, drawing a number of tech-savvy participants. In response to a push for getting more devices into the hands of students, Katy Kasmai, an engineer and advocate for technology education, tweeted, Lets teach kids to solve problems and build rather than be tech consumers.
The candidates had tablets on which they could view the audience feedback, which was shown on a large screen behind them, but they didnt appear to be checking often, and there was no obvious pandering to audience reaction.  
It wasnt a debate where people were arguing too much. They were on the same page, said Banks. They did have unique ways of looking at some of the challenges of the digital divide and charter schools. We werent doing an educational debate, but education is important in terms of STEM issues.
Even if the debate itself was more highly charged, Brenner said most candidates arent going to change their answers based on audience favorability. But they will benefit from the instant data and demographic breakdown.
The more that citizens have a role in the conversation, the more responsive locally that the candidates will be, he added.
The big screen in the room definitely captured the audiences attention, said Banks. It was so interactive and engaging, not a person moved for an hour and a half. You couldnt take your eyes off the screen.
Aside from the wi-fi issues, Banks said he couldnt be more pleased with how the event turned out. It was as diverse of an audience as you can find in this country, and they were civically engaged, he said, adding that its not every day that people in Harlem are asked to share their opinions on technology and community issues.
Everyone loved seeing their vote counted, if you will, he added, referring to the instant gratification of seeing the Pulse survey bar change upon the press of a button. And, most importantly, the debate galvanized the community around issues that could well determine its future.
This isnt a Harlem issue, this is a national issue, said Banks. We need the nation to see, hear, and talk about the future of our communities and how its directly tied to technology and innovation.

Its the most open and honest response I have received from any New York City agency to date, writes I Quant NYs Ben Wellington, of the NYPDs response to his data analysis showing that they had regularly ticketed legal parking spots across the city to the tune of $1.7 million a year. THIS is what the future of government could look like one day. THIS is what Open Data is all about, Wellington writes, optimistically (might be harder to see it that way if you drive a car in the city and have received one of these erroneous tickets). Imagine a city where all agencies embrace this sort of analysis instead of deflect and hide from it.
Democracies provide pathways for government to learn from their citizens, Wellington continues. Open data makes those pathways so much more powerful. In this case, the NYPD acknowledged the mistake, is retraining its officers and is putting in monitoring to limit this type of erroneous ticketing from happening in the future. In doing so, they have shown that they are ready and willing to work with the people of the city. And what better gift can we get from Open Data than that.


Un-civic technology: Writing for The Verge, Colin Lecher has the story of the family that decided to fight back against the system in which a 15-minute phone call in prison can cost more than $17 dollars, putting an excessive burden on the families of the incarcerated and sometimes ending communication altogether.


Brave new world: John Markoff reports for the New York Times on the Pentagons aggressive turn to artificial intelligence. Best to quote verbatim here:
In recent weeks, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work has repeatedly emphasized the importance of A.I.-related technologies that he believes will help create a new class of Iron Man-style fighters armed with increasingly smart weapons.
He has invoked the concept of Centaur Warfightingsystems that combine A.I. with the capabilities of humans, resulting in faster responses than humans alone could achieve...The Defense Department will need Silicon Valleys help with that technology.
But, Markoff reports, Silicon Valley technologists are wary of partnering with the military.


Marc Caputo reports for Capital New York on the Clinton-Sanders proxy fight taking place in Florida between Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her challenger, the progressive Tim Canova, who will have pulled in $1 million in donations by this weekend, mostly from small-dollar donors who also have supported Bernie Sanders. A sign that the excitement around Sanders wont all be for naught?

In a New York Times op-ed, Texan Richard Parker explains why Uber and Lyft lost so badly in a recent Austin referendum. It has something to do with keeping a place weird. Not everyoneor even every community or citywants to be disrupted.


Life in Facebookistan: The New York Times, among others, recently began an initiative to broadcast live video, writes the Times Farhad Manjoo. Why do you suppose that might be? Yup, the F word. He joins a loud chorus of internet voices to say that Facebook is really influential, really media, and really edited, citing Data & Society research analyst Robyn Caplan, who says, Algorithms equal editors...With Facebook, humans are never not involved. Humans are in every step of the processin terms of what were clicking on, whos shifting the algorithms behind the scenes, what kind of user testing is being done, and the initial training data provided by humans.


Danny Yadron writes for the Guardian that Facebook isnt likely to be the last technology company accused of media bias in its news products, pointing out that Apple, Twitter, Snapchat, and Google have hired former journalists to shape what is and isnt a top news item.

Life in Facebookistan: Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-SD) has written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding answers to questions about how the companys Trending Topics feature is curated and asking for details about what steps the company is taking to investigate claims that it is subject to political manipulation.


Writing on his Facebook page, Harold Feld, the VP of Public Knowledge, drily commented, We will now savor the irony that conservatives who attacked Net Neutrality as the Fairness Doctrine for the Internet now want a Fairness Doctrine for the Internet. How can FB be censoring conservative perspectives when there is all that competition in the social media space? And wouldnt it be irrational and contrary to their economic interests to discriminate like that?


What Feld is actually saying is that, like Comcast or Verizon, Facebook is an internet monopolist, or close to one, and if you are concerned about its power to pick winners and losers or artificially create scarcities to charge rent for, or bias the news, you should be concerned about the big internet service providers too.


Those of us with long memories may find it ironic that Senator Thune is complaining about Facebook possibly biasing the news, considering that as a candidate for Senate back in 2004, his campaign paid several local conservative bloggers to inject a frenzy of dubious factoids and thinly-sourced opposition research into state media. As Jan Frel reported for PersonalDemocracy.com back then (yes kids, thats what we called it before techPresident or Civicist), these bloggerswhose payments from Thune were not disclosed until after the electionsuccessfully raised questions about the political leanings of the states main newspaper. Thune later bragged about how useful those biased bloggers were for his campaign; now as a Senator, of course, hes an enemy of media bias.


Conservative writer Katrina Trinko of The Daily Signal is angry that Facebook curators reportedly suppressed attention to topics like the controversy involving IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused of inappropriately targeting conservative groups for audits.


Nilay Patel of The Verge helpfully points out that Facebooks Trending Topics box is hardly the most important driver of its users attentionthat would be its mobile News Feed, which doesnt include trending topics.


Kate Losse, the author of The Boy Kings, a really excellent memoir of her days at early Facebook, writes for Fusion that the real news curators at Facebook are the engineers who write its algorithms and who decided, say, that party photos of friends were of greater social importance than, say, religious texts. And given that the company refuses to be more transparent about the decisions baked into its news algorithms, she points out that we cant really evaluate the merit of its news judgments.


This is civic tech: Welcome to SuperPublic, a new co-working space in San Francisco where federal, state and city government come together to address policy and regulatory issues and work with academia and the private industry, that will be run by the City Innovate Foundation.

What sharing economy? Uber has struck a deal with a branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union to allow the creation of an association of its drivers in New York, Noam Scheiber and Mike Isaac report for the New York Times. The deal creates a process for drivers to meet with Uber officials and a way for them to get union officials to represent them in appeals of company decisions, but it does not enable them to bargain collectively over the terms of their relationship with Uber. Abdoul Diallo, the founder of a competing effort to organize drivers in NYC, said the new organization sounded bogus.

Great leaders tweet. Thats the kindest thing Jon Stewart had to say about Donald Trump, speaking at the Chicago Institute of Politics with David Axelrod. He also compares the heads of network news to crack dealers who are praising Trump as great for business.


Wait, theres more, very much on the topic of civic tech: At minute 37 in the Stewart video, he asks why, if the President can issue an order to kill an American citizen by drone missile, he cant issue an executive order to force the VA and DOD to reevaluate their computer systems so that you dont spend a billion dollars trying to get two computer programs to talk to each other, when probably three of these idiots [he points to the students in the audience] can do it for $500. He adds, that the failure to fix government opened the door for assholes like Trump. Democrats havent done enough to show that government can be effective for people and be efficient for peopleand if you cant do that, youve lost the right to make that change and someone is going to come in and demagogue you. Axelrod, who was a senior advisor to President Obama upon his entering office, blames bureaucracy piled on bureaucracy for the problem. If people can see your re-election effort be incredibly agile, Stewart responds, why are we so good at campaigns and so bad at governance?


This is civic tech: Our Jessica McKenzie talks to Eddie Tejeda and Steven Spiker, the co-founders of OpenOakland, about why they both recently decided to step down from leading the organization and the ongoing challenges of making a local civic tech group sustainable. Under their leadership, Open Oakland spearheaded projects like OpenDisclosure, which turns campaign finance filings into easy-to-read and easy-to-search charts and maps, Parklandish, a (currently inactive) tool that helps people find public parking and public restrooms in Oakland, and Open Budget: Oakland, a web app for visualizing the city budget. Making OpenOakland a more formal, established organization would require, Tejeda said, very patient capital. Spiker added, We found it very difficult to find money that fit where we wanted to go and what we wanted to be.

Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and weve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.

The co-founders of OpenOakland, Steven Spiker (left) and Eddie Tejeda.
Last month the co-founders of OpenOakland, a flourishing Code for America brigade and civic tech community, announced that they were stepping down from their positions as co-captains, leaving the organization in the care of an executive leadership team.
After running OpenOakland for several yearsfinding time in their evenings and weekends to organize hacknights and maintain civic appsEddie Tejeda and Steven Spiker both felt over-committed, and struggled to maintain a work-life-OpenOakland balance. Over the years, OpenOakland grew, but significant funding never materialized, and the volunteer-led organization became difficult to maintain. Although its business-as-usual for now, the leadership team is currently discussing what a future OpenOakland might look like, and whether they should refocus or narrow their objectives in pursuit of sustainability.
Tejeda and Spiker started OpenOakland in 2012, and have been running weekly hacknights and spearheading open government and community technology projects ever since. When they met, Tejeda was a Code for America fellow with experience working at the intersection of old industriespublishing and academiaand new technologies. Spiker was working on research and technology at a social justice nonprofit, and was well-regarded as an Oakland expert, which is why Tejeda says he chose him as a mentor through the Code for America fellowship program.
At the time, Spiker told Civicist, they could see that the city was struggling, in many ways:
We saw that local government was struggling to use technology very well at all, was struggling to consider open source technology, and was struggling with anything around openness and transparency. It was very hard to find any information, it was very hard to access information, and there was lots of really bad trust, or lack of trust.

Spiker and Tejeda knew that there were people in the community invested in the ideals of open government and transparency and interested in helping the city do better, they just needed an outlet for their energiesan outlet like OpenOakland.
The early days were a sort of discovery process as Spiker and Tejeda figured out what OpenOakland was and what its place was in the community. The first few meetings were at Spikers office, then at the Oakland Tribune, before landing finally in City Hall.
We had to figure out exactly how, where we would fit in, Tejeda told Civicist. We made a few mistakes early on and we adjusted, and maybe we over adjusted, and over the course of a few years we had folks from the city trust us on projects, but it was neverit was a weird tension where it was never clear where we fit in exactly. So we were always negotiating it, and always having to figure out exactly what we were doing, who were we serving, who was it that were ultimately accountable to.
Tejeda said that parsing crime data is a good example of how OpenOakland tread carefully with city government. We have to be very careful in terms of what story we think were telling with the data, he said. And also make sure that if were saying something, that the city understands that thats the real interpretation of whats going on.
It would be easier, Tejeda argued, if the organization didnt have a relationship with the city to preserve: We could make claims about what we believe and not take the citys point of view at all, he said. And vice versa; if we were part of the city we would have to go through whatever communications department, whatever messaging they want to communicate.
We were just in that middle zone, Tejeda said. Where sometimes we broke with them and sometimes we worked with them.
OpenOakland has spearheaded projects like OpenDisclosure, which turns campaign finance filings into easy-to-read and easy-to-search charts and maps, Parklandish, a (currently inactive) tool that helps people find public parking and public restrooms in Oakland, and Open Budget: Oakland, a web app for visualizing the city budget.
The time commitment to keep up with the various projects and weekly hacknights wasnt enormousa few hours a day around big events but usually no more than a days work over the course of a weekbut it took a toll nonetheless.
Keeping this pace has [been] challenging for me, Tejeda wrote shortly after the announcement was made last month. Personally, I found it difficult managing existing projects and relationships while engaging in new ones. For example, I started a company and wanted to make sure I still had time for friends and family, and suddenly I was not keeping up the way I wanted to.
Spiker was even more explicit, putting burnout in #civictech in the title of his blog post.
...Were at a point where we both need space in our lives that isnt possible with paying jobs and leading a civic organization, Spiker wrote. Not anymore at least.
He continued:
Ive balanced my family (three little girls), my marriage and my love for Oakland and for what weve made through OpenOakland, but its become harder to put in the time needed to really grown and develop and organization at this phase...Im aware that Ive sacrificed much but Ive loved doing so. But I need space for myself, space to get physically fit again, space to enjoy being a dad and not compromising weekends with my kids for retreats or hack days, and space to enjoy being a husband and not having all those evening events.

At this point, Spiker touches on another challenge that OpenOakland and other nonprofit civic tech organizations face: a lack of fiscal support. Spiker wrote that he and his wife had agreed that he would step back on several occasions if it wasnt clear there was a fundable role to take on.
He admits that several of those agreed-to dates had already passed before he finally stepped down.
The challenge to find financial support for OpenOakland was two-fold: a general shortage of funding for nonprofit civic organizations, especially general operating budgets (as opposed to specific projects); and too many strings attached to the opportunities that did present themselves.
Making OpenOakland a more formal, established organization would require, Tejeda said, very patient capital.
We found it very difficult to find money that fit where we wanted to go and what we wanted to be, Spiker told Civicist.
According to Spiker, the only significant funding that ever materialized had too many conditions attached, and Spiker and Tejeda turned it down. Spiker said it might have been right for an organization that had already been around for five years, but that it wasnt a good fit for a brand-new organization.
We didnt want to be compromised, Tejeda said. We didnt want to just take in money just because the money was there, and then suddenly we would have expectations that were outside of what it is that we believed was the most important.
OpenOakland did accept small sums from the Kapor Foundation and Code for America for specific events like hackathons or CityCamps, but they never covered much more than the cost of running the event.
In a lot of ways I cant believe weve been able to do it for so long and produced so much because we [Spiker and I] havent taken any money at all, Tejeda said.
There isnt anyone thats figured this out yet, Spiker told Civicist. Like, this particular type of organizationthat we can telldoesnt exist anywhere in the U.S. thats been funded effectively and has any staff, anywhere. There are organizations that are starting to get small grants here and there, or small projects, but by and large theyre tiny and theres no one thats actually figured out what the model is.
Were not organizing, were not activism, but were also not VC funded tech, he added. We exist in a weird middle space. Were in some ways a new civic institution, but those are hard to fund also.
The funding conundrum puts OpenOakland at a crossroads, where they can either work to take OpenOakland to the next level, as Spiker put it, or to devolve the organization to a community-led board made up of the leadership team.
[Were currently] considering what is it that we actually do well and should do, Spiker said. We traditionally do all these thingswe do events and apps and advocacy and community buildingbut what of those things do we do really well and what are those things should we actually focus on in a more manageable environment.
It seems this soul-searching will likely result in a pared-down OpenOakland.
We dont know exactly how thats going to play out, Spiker said. But it wouldnt be a surprise if the tech fell out of that and it became more open government advocacy, and technology advocacy, and privacy and surveillance related and a whole lot of community-building and events stuff, and no building apps. Thats one eventuality that could come out of it, or it could be that something else changes.
In the next few weeks and months, as the new leadership of OpenOakland tries to crack the nut that has yet to be cracked, dozens of Code for America brigades and other civic hacking communities around the country will surely be watching closely.

Civic HackingCivic Tech 





This is civic tech: This morning, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled out the citys new Digital Playbook with an announcement event here at Civic Hall. Its goal is to improve constantly the delivery of City services, embrace government transparency, generate genuine civic engagement, and make New York the most user-friendly and innovative city in the world. The playbook calls for the development of accurate, responsive services, human-centered research, design and evaluation,seamless services across multiple agencies, a single sign-on experience for users, and the use of common data standards to make it easier for people to access, share, and build on the citys information.


This is another element of fighting inequality, de Blasio declared. To make more information available and to make more access to power available. We intend to be very focused in breaking down those barriers and opening things up....Its our obligation to be in a constant dialogue with our people. He called on the citys tech community to hold City Hall accountable to the promises in the playbook, and insisted that they were essential to his administrations efforts to improve housing, education and the like.


In addition to Jessica Singleton, the citys chief digital officer and Minerva Tantoco, the citys chief technology officer, de Blasio gave credit for the playbooks development to Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and Councilman Ben Kallos for their ongoing efforts to make the city more digital.


Ironically, de Blasio was interviewed by new Uber board member Arianna Huffington, who took several opportunities to plug her current book project, the need to recharge and the value of getting 8 hours of sleepthings that techies tend to think about only in terms of lithium ion batteries and weeks, not days.


And despite his call to open things up and be in constant dialogue with our people, the Mayor and Huffington unfortunately had no time to take questions from the public during the launch event.


With the launch of the NYC Digital Services Playbook, technology, data, and design become the corner stone of a 21st century New York City, Noel Hidalgo, the Executive Director of BetaNYC commented, applauding the launch. BetaNYC is calling for the city to create a unified digital services department to insure that the principles laid out in the playbook actually get implemented.


In other civic tech news, the Smart Chicago Collaborative is going to start putting some of its civic tech code up on Amazon as machine images, in partnership with Uturn Data Solutions, Daniel ONeil announces.


Derek Eder of Chi Hack Night offers 10 lessons for how to organize a successful local civic hacking community.


Placemeters David Fine argues that civic hacking sits at the intersection of application development, data science and activism/advocacy.


What sharing economy? Uber and Lyft spent $8 million pushing to get the city of Austin, Texas to end a local regulation requiring fingerprinting and criminal background checks of drivers who use ride-hailing apps, about 100 times more than supporters of the rule, but on Saturday the companies lost 56-44 percent at the ballot box.


Uber is also being sued in federal court by a local Austin activist for allegedly robo-texting thousands of Austinites as part of its campaign to get out the vote, Nolan Hicks reports for the Austin American-Statesman. (To prevent spam, it is illegal to mass-text message recipients.)


Crypto-wars, continued: Twitter is reportedly no longer allowing Dataminr to sell data services to U.S. intelligence agencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This literally is giving me goose-bumps: In the last day, Chinas Baidu.com search engine has unblocked results for tank man, our man in Shanghai, Clay Shirky, shares via Twitter. Many people dont get how successful the Party has been in putting the Tiananmen massacre in a memory hole. Showing the image is amazing, he adds. He estimates, at a conservative guess, thereve been a billion screenshots taken of various banned images, jokes and memes during the last day. As he explains, the government has been drastically tightening up its media control and for some reason Baidu executives are fighting back. This will not end well, Shirky notes.


Tech and politics: With Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaign starting to run out of steam, Jonathan Mahler and Nick Corasaniti report for the New York Times on where his online foot soldiers will turn. They quote some dude named Sifry who points out that its not an army, its a swarm, and warns that Hillary Clinton will have to win their support with honey, but if she tries to command them, theyll just sting her. As swarms may do.


Tucked deftly inside David Samuels long profile in the New York Times Magazine of Obama speechwriter and foreign policy guru Ben Rhodes is a valuable analysis of how the White House gets its message out in the age of digital media (and the collapse of foreign news bureaus). With the old-fashioned bully pulpit gone, David Axelrod, a longtime Obama confidant, tells Samuels: ...more and more, over the last couple of years, theres been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found. I think theyve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and theyve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.


As a case in point, Samuels details the work that went into the digital campaign to sell the Iran deal, which literally included a Twitter account called @TheIranDeal. He writes, By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing onlineand make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.


What if chat conversations become the new media? Thats the essence of this almost classically overheated profile of Silicon Valley start-up Sidewire, which managed to snag a long profile by David Lidsky in Fast Company. Sidewises founders are currently pegging their hopes on being the hot new political app of 2016 (nope, that was Meerkat), and the company has the requisite mix of former DC insiders hoping to get rich off that tech-politics thing and a 21-year-old co-founder who dropped out of Stanford and namedrops books like Godel, Escher, Bach. The funny thing about Sidewires main productthe ability to share 250-character comments in real-timeis that its tuned to meeting the needs of the same self-referential inside-the-Beltway group of DC villagers who now obsess over Twitter. But they get an extra 110 characters! Thats clearly something millions of Americans are begging for, since they cant chat with their friends at length anywhere else, right?


Why you should use encryption: Buried deep inside this mind-blowing expose by Troy LaRaviere, a Chicago elementary school principal, detailing yet more corruption in Rahm Emanuels Chicago, is this nugget: Chicago Public Schools bureaucrats apparently were monitoring his official school Gmail account to spot references to sensitive matters like a massive privatization contract with Aramark/Sodexo, companies making hundreds of millions of dollars handling what used to be public sector janitorial jobs in school. LaRaviere has been described as Emanuels biggest critic, and after you read his post, youll understand why.


This is civic tech: Our Jessica McKenzie reports on Zooniverses Project Builder, which she calls a WordPress for Plug-and-Play Citizen Science. (And I think of it as a virtual analog to that 3-D printer that can print more 3-D printers, only for crowdsourcing projects.)


The neighborhood-centric private social network NextDoor.com continues to stir up concerns that it intensifies the paranoia of affluent white communities about crime, as Kafeh Waddell reports for The Atlantic. This time the locus of controversy is Seattle, where the city police department is trying a variety of ways of improving public engagement, including social media.


Brave new world: Top White House officials Megan Smith, D.J. Patel, and Cecilia Munoz sum up a new Obama administration report on big data and civil rights, warning that The algorithmic systems that turn data into information are not infalliblethey rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them. Predictors of success can become barriers to entry; careful marketing can be rooted in stereotype. Without deliberate care, these innovations can easily hardwire discrimination, reinforce bias, and mask opportunity.


Trump watch: Writing for Vox, David Roberts makes a very smart and sobering point about the coming general election battle: the political industrial complex, and the media in particular, needs the race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to seem close, even if it is destined to be a blowout, because The machine is simply not built to handle a race thats over before its begun.


New America DC is looking to hire two research associates. Bonus: you get to work with (not for) Laurenellen McCann.

One Zooniverse project uses tourist snapshots to survey of marine life. (Photo: Dr.Haus/Wikimedia)

Since the citizen science project Galaxy Zoo launched in 2007, more than 1.4 million individuals globally have been drawn in to one Zooniverse project or another: helping scientists classify distant galaxies, identify whales by the patterns on their tales, characterize bat calls, and transcribe historical documents, to name just a few of their contributions. The projects hosted on Zooniverse have resulted in more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles, including 14 meta-studies about citizen science itself, and the platform has been widely praised for democratizing science and building community online. Last year, Zooniverse launched a project builder that allows anyone in the world to create a citizen science project in just minutes, making the platform even more open and accessible to all.
The project builder has significantly increased Zooniverses capacity to do citizen science. From 2007 until the launch of the project builder in 2015, Zooniverse put out 41 projects, roughly five each year. Since releasing the project builder, the Zooniverse community has created and launched 15 projects, in addition to five projects created by Zooniverse researchers, for a total of 20 in only one year. Grant Miller, who runs special projects and communications for Zooniverse, says that there are 11 more working their way through the pipeline right now.
Before the project builder went online, proposals had to go through the Zooniverse administrators, causing a bottleneck and an unnecessarily high rejection rate. Of the 50 to 100 proposals submitted each year, Zooniverse could only select a small fraction to work with. After projects were chosen, web developers were brought in to build a project website, which then had to be alpha tested. Miller told Civicist that the time between acceptance and launch could be as long as a year.
In 2013, Zooniverse received a Google Impact Award to begin working on the project builder. Like Facebook or WordPress, the platform is plug-and-play, and anyone with basic computer know-how and a large dataset on hand can get a project ready to go in an hour or less.
The Zooniverse team still take the first look, but instead of deciding which projects are worthy of their attention, time, and resources, as before, they simply verify that it is a serious project, that it is sound, and that it could stand up to peer review. If they have any questions that the scientists or academics on the team cant answer, Zooniverse will reach out to an expert in the field. After receiving initial approval, the project is submitted to a self-selected group of 30,000 Zooniverse volunteers who have noted in their profiles that they are interested in reviewing projects in beta.
Miller told Civicist that 10 percent of that group will open the email and look at the project, and 100 or so will fill out the feedback form. The individual or team behind the project is asked to respond to the community response, the Zooniverse team takes one final look, and the project is ready to launch.

Not everyone wants to put their project out to the entire Zooniverse base of 1.4 million citizen scientists. Some researchers have adopted the platform for projects on a smaller scale that can be completed with five or ten research assistants in just a few weeks. Miller said there are a couple hundred of these projects in existence, although its hard to tell how many are in active use and how many are prototypes.
Chris Lintott, an astronomer and the founder of Galaxy Zoo and Zooniverse, told Civicist that the people submitting projects on the project builder are mostly professional scientists, often relatively junior in their fieldeither newly-tenured professors or post-doctorates. Lintott compares the platform to an emergency service.
Dial 1-800-Zooniverse if you have too many images to look at, he joked.
He said that since Galaxy Zoo launched in 2007 that Zooniverse has been a series of experiments on what works and what doesnt in citizen science, so they can give fairly specific advice to researchers hoping to launch projects on the platform.
The Zooniverse team originally hypothesized, for example, that projects with pretty pictures would be more popular, but after a while they saw no correlation. It links to the idea that people are doing this because theyre in it for the research, said Lintott. The exception to this rule, he added, would be projects about animals, which are often some of the most popular.
Lintott and Miller point to Fossil Finder, which helps archaeologists find and classify fossils in northern Kenya, and Snapshots at Sea, a survey of whales based on tourist snapshots, as exemplary examples of projects that have been built on the new platform.

Theres one really cool project called Monopole Quest, said Miller. The project involves classifying particle signatures as part of the search for the magnetic monopole hypothesized by Paul Dirac. I didnt even find out about [Monopole Quest] until I went to a meeting at the Royal Society, a kind of event, and there was this group of school kids showing it off. And I was like, I recognize that design.
We had no idea because they didnt need us anymore, said Miller. Its kind of weird, that weve entered this universe where were not involved in all the projects anymore. Which is kind of where we wanted to go but is also kind of scary.

Donald Trump in 2011 (Photo: Gage Skidmore)

Donald J. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. For the Presidency. Of the United States of America.
This is, in fact, happening. Weve had months to adjust to this alternate reality, in which everything we thought we knew about how American presidential elections work is turned on its head. But today its worth pausing to note just how weird it is, and wonder how we got here.
For those who have comfortably adjusted their expectations, please take a moment and imagine having a conversation with the version of you living in May 6, 2015. It was a simpler time. Trump had not yet announced his candidacy. The idea of a Trump presidency was a Simpsons punchline, a gift for Jon Stewarts farewell tour. As a political scientist, I made light of Trumps early rise in the polls. We knew what this was. John Sides and Lynn Vavreck refer to it as the discovery-scrutiny-decline cycle. In 2012, candidates like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain had briefly stood atop the polls as well. But media attention leads to public scrutiny, which eventually leads to a polling decline for the non-serious candidates. Media coverage and poll numbers rise and fall. It is as predictable as the tides. Candidates like Donald Trump dont maintain their media dominance for the entire primary season. Their misstatements and lack of party support eventually prove to be their undoing. Last summer, I routinely joked that Trump becoming the nominee would be the equivalent for American political scientists of the collapse of the Soviet Union for the Kremlinologists in the 1990s. (That joke has aged poorly.)
Why didnt the discovery-scrutiny-decline cycle happen to Trump? It happened to Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina (remember them?). What is it that made Trump different?
There isnt one singular explanation, of course. Trump is a unique celebrity candidate, with a particular talent for turning subtext into text. And he benefited from a crowded field that featured a never-ending series of strategic pratfalls by his opponents.
But, to my eyes, one feature stands out above the rest: Trumps utter dominance of media coverage (print, online, and television). Trump didnt have a brief moment in the sun, followed by a return to normalcy as the media directed attention at his competitors. Even when Ben Carson or Marco Rubio were rising in the polls, Trump was never out of the public spotlight for longer than a moment.
Six weeks ago, Nick Confessore and Karen Yourish covered this point for the New York Times Upshot blog. Donald Trump received approximately six times as much media attention as his closest rival, Ted Cruz. Cruz, you might recall, is also a bit of a showman with a penchant for making wild, offensive claims. (Remember that time he shut down the entire government in what was basically a publicity stunt?)
The simple explanation for Trumps media advantage is: Look at the ratings! Were giving the people what they want. And that explanation is correct. Trump news, Trump articles, Trump hot-takes all did far better than their competitors. The Republican primaries with Trump have been far more entertaining than the primaries without Trump. CBS chairman Les Moonves has remarked that Trumps candidacy may not be good for America, but its damn good for CBS. Ross Douthat has likewise noted that Trump is such a gift to our industry.
But I think the simple explanation puts the emphasis in the wrong place. Trumps media dominance isnt caused by public demand for Trump. It is caused by the medias new tools for looking at the ratings!
Gawker CEO Nick Denton once proclaimed that Probably the biggest change in internet media isnt the immediacy of it, or the low costs, but the measurability. Today, all online media outlets rely on sophisticated analytics to track, monitor, and judge which stories are the most popular. Some of these analytics are made public, through most read, most emailed, trending or related sidebars on their sites. Others are maintained internally, as a tool to aid editorial judgment.
The thing that we have to remember here is that the act of measuring a process will also change that process. Analytics sends a signal to journalists and their editors (Trump brings in way more traffic than Bush/Cruz/Walker/Clinton/Sanders/Carson). And this signal then helps guide their news routines (people seem to want more Trump, lets give it to them), which in turn sets up a positive feedback loop, in which Trumps endless media dominance feeds into the narrative that this election is All About Trump.
In a world with digital media, but less analytics, this election drama would have unfolded differently. Trump would still have been the same showman. He would still have the same instincts, and the same Twitter skills, and the same press conference behavior. But journalists and their editors would have been less attuned to the immediate feedback of Trumps daily ratings effects, and this would have led them to spread their coverage more evenly (as they always have in the past). Trumps media dominance isnt just driven by our attention, its driven by the media industrys new tools for measuring and responding to that attention.
So today, as we think about the all-too-real possibility of a Trump presidency, I think its useful to recall Schrodingers Cat. Outside the realm of quantum mechanics, Schrodingers Cat is usually used as a reference to how the act of observation can affect reality.
Weve now become Schrodingers Audience.
The act of observation has helped to create this reality.

We are witnessing a compression of the working period in which bad policy shelters in the shadows, writes Edward Snowden in this essay for The Intercept on what it means to be a whistleblower. Daniel Ellsberg had to wait 40 years for Edward Snowden; Snowden only had to wait a few before someone else came forward with the documents that informed The Intercepts series The Drone Papers and a just-released book by Jeremy Scahill called The Assassination Complex. This compression, Snowden continues, ...permits the people of this country to learn about critical government actions, not as part of the historical record but in a way that allows direct action through votingin other words, in a way that empowers an informed citizenry to defend the democracy that state secrets are nominally intended to support. After pointing out that the government often releases information that is politically advantageous, even if it is harmful to national security, Snowden says, Truly unauthorized disclosures are necessarily an act of resistance.

A version of this essay was originally published on the SeeClickFix channel on Medium.
Picture a classroom where the teacher presents their information, but the students are not invited to ask questions or present their opinion. Attendance is not mandatory. Now picture the classroom in its fourth week. Theres a teacher standing in an empty classroom, right?
Over the past seven years the White House has made accessible much of the data inside federal agencies. Opening up troves of government data has been a crucial first step in providing accountability and accessibility at the top level of government. The open data effort has been fueled in part by advocacy efforts from within and without government. Sometimes it has been collaboration that has moved the ball forward and sometimes it has been outside unwelcomed pressure. There have been lively debates on which method is more effective. Movement leaders like John Wonderlich and Tom Steinberg have recently debated whether collaboration or gate crashing is the best approach. There is a general sentiment that as open data advocates we have fallen short of our expectations.
I take the stance that we have done a pretty good job at accessing and sharing previously inaccessible government data. Our shortcoming, and a huge opportunity at the federal level, is in the sharing of citizen data. Specifically the requesting of services from the federal government. By adding layers of transparency, feedback loops, and more engaging front-ends to the federal government we can popularize the open data movement.
The success of the open data movement at the local level can best be measured in the number of citizens who interact with and create the open data but do not necessarily consider themselves advocates for open data. Take the millions of people who have used transparent service request platforms like SeeClickFix and Connected Bits as examples. Most of the users of those platforms are not even familiar with the term open data, but they are creating it and making use of it.
At the federal level we needs to focus our efforts on the services that everyday citizens interact with. For most people government exists to serve their individual needs and the needs of their individual communities. They have little interest in budgeting, procurement, or overall performance.
The next open data movement needs to be about making more ways for citizens to be open with our government now that our government is more open with its citizens. In helping more citizens be open with their government we will make the open data movement a popular movement protected by collective self interest. Early advocates, including myself, wont have to worry about failing as our efforts will have provided tangible benefit to a substantially larger audience. Through the persistent use of open data services the larger audience will assure the endurance of open data.
Act Two  Step One
We need a data standard for open communication between citizens and the federal government. Good news: We already have one at the local level. This is what part two of the federal open data movement should look like.
In 2009, SeeClickFix helped create Open311 with partners from around the world. Open311 is a read/write API that makes it easy for government to listen to residents and residents to listen to government. If a resident reports a pothole or asks for any service via the Open311 API, that service request is delivered to local government in a transparent and actionable data format which promotes constructive feedback loops and holistic and measurable results. SeeClickFix is a platform that has enabled this standard for nearly 300 cities and has documented nearly 2.5 million public service requests engaging millions of citizens. This is just one private company helping local government to provide service. The next phase of the federal data movement needs to look at how the Open311 standard can be applied to all federal services.
Act Two  Step Two
We need to pick some low hanging fruit that would benefit from these services. At the local level SeeClickFix was first used for public works-related issues but as of late it has been used by police departments and local veterans affairs offices. Below are some suggestions for agencies that could be servicing the potholes of the federal government. All of these agencies could benefit from a standardized, machine-readable way of listening to its constituents.
HUD
In New Haven, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently failed the residents of Church Street South, a large public housing community that plummeted to a failing score, with 512 life-threatening violations, in only a year after a mostly positive review. The complex was then slated to be demolished. If youre looking for the road to hell and its good intentions, look no further than Church Street South and all of its cousins scattered around urban America. Roof leaks, water supply leaks, and sewage leaks caused untenable conditions to the point of demolition. Long before demolition, those leaks caused mold which contributed to asthma and other illness in a community with the highest asthma rates in the country. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) has been working to create legislation that would require mold to be part of the REAC guidelines for HUD. These guideline mandate reporting processes for certain types of maintenance requests. SeeClickFix has recently started working with the New Haven Housing Authority which also follows these mandates for maintenance and repair.
One way to make sure that a Church Street South crisis never happens again is mandating a transparent reporting process via the Open311 standard. Imagine a world where every public housing tenant, their advocates and the folks that maintain the properties had a constructive and engaging way to document problems in their building. They could take photos of the problem with their smartphones, submit a request or call in a complaint to a service desk, and their communication would be actionable for the local maintenance crews and accessible to HUD and the public for accountability and oversight. If a system like SeeClickFix had been mandated at Church Street South the building might never have had to be demolished. With public visibility into the interior of the building through photos taken by tenants, it would have been politically impossible for the blight to continue and the tenants might still be able to live there comfortably.
FEMA
During Hurricane Sandy, volunteers in Crisfield, MD, leveraged SeeClickFix to document and triage all of the flooding, power outages, and downed trees in advance of FEMA on the ground. This was a grassroots effort to engage with the federal government and help out neighbors. Similar groups have leveraged Ushahidi in natural disasters like the Haiti earthquake. If FEMA had a system for receiving these complaints in a standardized way platforms like Twitter, Facebook, SeeClickFix and the next hot civic technology or social application would be able to inform the government constructively while doing what they do bestengage humans. And these efforts would not be novel every time a disaster occurred. FEMA would know that they had a way of triaging the crisis by leveraging people on the ground, and people on the ground would feel less isolated in times of need. Further, the transparent nature of reporting to authorities has the benefit of informing neighbors who can help as well. Check out Snowcrew for an example of a volunteer platform that leverages Open311.
National Parks Service
The National Parks Service has roughly 15,000 employees to monitor and maintain its 84.4 million acres. There is no way to watch and maintain all of those trails with so few employees. The Parks Service has always relied on volunteers. The 275 million people who visit every year could be the eyes of the department and even better some of them could be the hands where only volunteerism could reach, as Brianne Fisher suggested in a Civicist piece earlier this year. Imagine walking on a trail and you see a dumped mattress, chemicals leaking into a stream, or a tree down on a trail. With the Open311 standard in place and an application like SeeClickFix you could quickly document the incident and alert National Parks, the EPA, or a crew of volunteers who were using a tool like SeeClickFix to watch and receive alerts on the geography of the trail that they monitored.
Department of Labor
The Department of Labor oversees the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH). WHD is responsible for protecting workers from wage theft, enforcing minimum wage requirements, and making sure that other workplace standards for equitable pay are in place. OSHA is responsible for enforcing safe work environments. Both DOL and OSHA take complaints from citizens that could be made more accessible to the public through interfaces that encourage collaboration and enforcement at the local level. Take this issue from SeeClickFix as example:

At SeeClickFix we are currently engaged in conversations with DOL about how we might partner together in collaboration with the Workers Lab. A requirement for the Open311 standard at DOL would go along way towards helping these partnerships realize returns for citizens immediately.
EPA
From air quality monitoring to water source protection, the EPA already has standards in place for monitoring water run-off through tools like MS-4 permits, and there are air quality monitoring stations every couple of miles in urban areas. Imagine how much more granular the data would be for government if citizens were reporting on air quality and water contamination the way they are reporting potholes in Detroit.
We have had a few conversations with folks at EPA like Ethan McMahon who have had interest in how a localized reporting platform could better inform the efforts of the EPA. Lets move these conversations to the forefront of the work at the EPA and lets make sure that state agencies are engaged as well.
GSA and the U.S. Military
The General Services Administration manages all federal buildings. Ten of thousands of them around the country. The U.S. Military operates bases all around the country and all over the world. While it has been previously floated that Open311 could apply to services on federal buildings it has yet to come to fruition. Shouldnt President Obama be able to report that leaky toilet in the Oval with his smart phone?
CDC and Red Cross
What if residents around the country could report the spread of infections disease uniformly and ubiquitously to the federal government while exposing the data to academics and global health experts? This currently happens at some level but a standard reporting process for communicating with the federal government could only make this dataset more robust and actionable.
. . .
I know I sound like a hammer with a handful of nails. All of these examples have solutions that could be solved partially by SeeClickFix. And I know that the open data movement is bigger than service. That said, we have spent a lot of time on freeing data that already exists in government. I think we should focus our efforts on creating more new data. And applying an open data standard for federal service requests would likely go far beyond what I have outlined above. Where else is this conversation happening and where else could it be happening? I want the next open data movement in the federal government to be about data that is being shared with the government as opposed to the other way around.

John Kennedy and Richard Nixon in the first-ever televised presidential debate on Sept. 26, 1960
Tweets from 196o: A new study on the distracting effects of tweeting while debate-viewing inspired television columnist Ellen Gray to wonder whether Twitter, which has served as her note-taking tool during recent debates, might be improving her focus instead.

To test her theory, she decided to tweet a debate she had never seen before: the first-ever televised U.S. presidential debate, featuring Vice President Richard Nixon and U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy.
The Sept. 26, 1960, debate is remembered for the emergence of television as an influential force in presidential politics. As the story goes, Kennedy edged out Nixon if you were watching on television, due to his charisma and tan, while Nixon came out on top if you were listening to the radio and didnt see him sweat. (You can watch the debate on YouTube or C-SPAN for yourself.)
Gray writes: 
Heres what I did: I kept myself to the 140-character Twitter limit. I paused only to check the time, and otherwise tweeted in real time. I have slightly reworded some of the original tweets. 
I wasnt actually on Twitter (because live-tweeting an event that took place nearly 56 years ago might call my sanity into more question than usual). I also wasnt engaging with others as I watched a sometimes fuzzy black-and-white recording on YouTube. But my real-time reactions led me to question what Id read and heard about the debate often credited with helping JFK win the presidency.

And who would have guessed Gray would note this: Dont care what you say: Veeps got a nice smile. #debate
The study from the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that watching presidential debates while using social media may have a negative effect on how much viewers learn about the candidatesespecially candidates they favor. The study examined the influence of using a second screen during the 2012 presidential election. 
Overall, debates are still an incredibly powerful forum in which people can learn about the candidates, said Jeffrey A. Gottfried, lead author of the study. But social media seem to be distracting viewers from learning.
Still, the study found that social-media users generally were significantly more knowledgeable than non-users about candidate stances and background facts of the 2012 presidential election.
Multitasking during debates has taken on new significance this election cycle, as the debates are much more integrated with Twitter and Facebook. Twitters partnership with CBS News during a Democratic debate in Iowa, for example, included a question inspired by a viewers tweet.
Were deep enough into the 2016 presidential campaign that we should probably avoid broad pronouncements based on four-year-old data, Adam Sharp, who heads Twitters government and elections team, told CNET.
It remains to be seen whether new forms of viewer engagement make a difference, but Gottfried isnt optimistic. He does, however, plan to re-do the survey using data from the 2016 general election. 
Plus: As we previously noted, a team of researchers found that people in the U.K. who use Twitter to discuss election debates are more likely to become politically engaged. Their study appears in the Journal of Communication. 
Who Gets Tickets to the Presidential Debates? Bloomberg Politics put together a short video showing the mix of invited guests to the Democratic debate in Brooklyn. Not invited was the owner of 2,000 pigeons who was called to get his pigeons under control.
They were concerned they were going to fly over the debate and [fly] over the reporters when they were trying to talk, he said. 
Debates Make a Comeback: An editorial at NJ.com praises a scheduled bipartisan primary debate for a U.S. House race, noting that debates for political races below governor and U.S. Senate had been in decline due in part to a personnel implosion in the mainstream media.
Newspapers and broadcasting outlets that were often sponsors no longer have enough warm bodies to get involved with multiple debates. Also, League of Women Voters groups seem to have tired of the hassles of scheduling reluctant candidates, reads the editorial. U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-2nd Dist., spent the last few elections sidelining marginal Democrat challengers to the point that he acted as if they didnt exist. A high-profile debate publicizes the underdog.
For the June 2 debate, the NAACP turned to the League of Women Voters to supply a moderator and partnered with a number of co-sponsorsa smart step to broaden a debates appeal and increase candidate buy-in.
Speaking of Ducking: Sen. Ted Cruz keeps challenging frontrunner Donald Trump to another debate, but no luck. Republicans have not held a debate since March 10.
Sharing the Stage: Bipartisan debates are becoming a thing in 2016. Besides New Jersey, in Florida, U.S. Senate hopefuls Rep. Alan Grayson, a Democrat, and Rep. David Jolly, engaged in an open debate, with questions culled entirely from the public, despite the primary election being months away. The Florida Open Debate was sponsored by the Open Debate Coalition.
And in California, three Republican and two Democratic U.S. Senate candidates debated on the same stage in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. (John Diaz of the San Francisco Chronicle takes readers behind the scenes, and notes suggested questions were sent in via social media and email.) The same five candidates are invited to a debate on May 10 at San Diego State University, the last debate before the primary.  
Sound Effects: During a panel on media coverage of U.S. politics held at the University of Virginia, Face the Nation host John Dickerson, who drew boos for correcting Cruz while moderating a Republican debate, said the Republican National Committee wants a louder debate audience.
The Republican National Committee wants people in there excited, Dickerson said. Its all about party fundraising. They want the crazy ruckus to make [the debate] seem like a party, but the problem is when the audience gets out of control.
Popularity and Impact of #PiliPinasDebates: The presidential debates in the Philippines, the first since 1992, have come to an end. The election will be held May 9. 
In an editorial, the daily newspaper Business Mirror said the most important result is that it has changed Philippine politics. 
Used to speaking before a sea of friendly faces, reads the editorial, now candidates have to deal with their supporters being only a minority in the audience. Used to saying whatever they want, the candidates now face immediate challenges to their ideas from the moderators and panelists, apart from the other hopefuls.
The people also gained much from this experience, the editorial continues. Access to the debates was available to everyone through a variety of outlets, including television, radio and Internet. There was no way for the candidates to run and hide no matter how uncomfortable they became. The public saw every drop of sweat, every scowl and every smile.
Three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate were sponsored by the Commission on Elections (Comelac) in conjunction with different media outlets. Comelac Chairman Juan Andres Andy Bautista said the debates helped voters to scrutinize the candidates and gave the candidates the opportunity to present themselves. (Its worth noting the frontrunner is known as Asias Donald Trump.) 
The Manila Bulletin reported that the final debate on April 24 featuring all five candidates generated more than 1.24 million tweets and received a national TV rating of 40.6 percentthe highest among the debates, according to Kantar Media. As with previous debates, more than 20 percent of the total debate time was taken up by TV ads.

This is civic tech: Last week at The Impacts of Civic Tech Conference (TICTeC) in Barcelona, hosted by mySociety, Matt Stempeck of Microsoft and my colleague Erin Simpson of Civic Hall Labs shared the first fruit of our ongoing work developing a civic tech field guide. Heres an overview of our taxonomy, as written up by Stempeck, who is the director of civic technology for Microsofts technology and civic engagement team. You can view (and edit) the field guide, which is very much still a work in progress, here.


Chicagos ambitious smart city initiative, known locally as the The Array of Things project, gets profiled in the Chicago Tribune by Kathy Bergen. And Daniel ONeil, head of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, explains why such data-driven initiatives have shortcomings: When I wake up and go outside, I dont see residents making a whole big fuss about enough civic data being released. Or hankering to know exact rainfall measures, block by block. Or demanding to see the exact nature of buried cable infrastructure. Instead, I see people shutting down Lake Shore Drive to demand justice for a police killing. I see protests of a Governor who cant lead, to devastating affect for poor people.


Washington D.C.s departing director of technology innovation Matt Bailey is heading to work for White House CIO on tech policy, but as he goes he shared these parting thoughts, as captured by Tasha Chappellet-Lanier for Technical.ly DC.


Crypto-wars, continued: Writing for Slate, veteran tech journalist Dan Gillmor points out that strong encryption will let venal politicians evade open government laws: What happens whennot ifthey take [their government emails] to Signal, a text-messaging and voice system that encrypts everything, or to PGP-encrypted email, where even if we get the records we wont be able to read them? But he still argues for strong crypto.


Tech and politics: The Republican convention is probably not going to use electronic balloting to certify its nominee, but as Darren Samuelsohn reports for Politico, officials are still considering it.


What sharing economy? Those new Uber for gas start-ups that will deliver fuel to your car while its parked? Local fire departments arent happy about them, and as Eric Newcomer reports for Bloomberg, in some cities like San Francisco, the companies are breaking the law.


Trump watch: In terms of our liberal democracy and constitutional order, Trump is an extinction-level event. Its long past time we started treating him as such. Thats how Andrew Sullivan ends his long meditation in New York Magazine on how democracies collapse into tyrannies. You may not accept every line of his argumentId quibble with how he describes the impact of Internet-powered organizing on democracy, for examplebut the whole thing is a must-read tour-de-force.


Note to readers: With Trump close to nailing down the GOP nomination and #NeverTrump voices in the Republican party starting to dissipate, its time we took the rise of Trump very seriously. Civic tech cant be neutral about a breakdown of democracy.

Florida Open Debate, April 25, 2016 / YouTube
There were no corporate sponsors, no commercials, and no questions about campaign politics.
In many ways, the open debate Monday night in Florida between U.S. Senate hopefuls Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. David Jolly set a new standard for how to engage candidates in substantive dialogue about issues that matter most to voters.

For starters, try asking the voters what they want to know.
Grayson, a Democrat, and Jolly, a Republican, havent won their respective primaries yettheyll try to do that in Augustbut they decided in March to start holding debates after declaring themselves frontrunners in a crowded race.
The Open Debate Coalition, backed by groups and individuals across the political spectrum that aim to make debates more of the people by building them around questions proposed and voted on by the public, offered to host. The Coalition invited Rep. Patrick Murphy, the only other candidate at the time polling at 15 percent. He declined.
Prior to the debate, Lilia Tamm, program director for the Open Debate Coalition, said the Coalition hopes the Florida event serves as a model for the 2016 presidential debates and becomes the norm for every political office. [Read her earlier interview with Civicist about the power of crowdsourcing and agenda setting.]
The timing of the Florida debate was fortunate. The Commission on Presidential Debates started holding meetings this week to plan the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate scheduled for this fall and is looking at different formats involving social media and public participation. Mike McCurry, co-chairman of the Commission, has already said the group is interested in any experiments or new technologies the Coalition uses to generate questions from the public.
More than 900 questions were submitted to FloridaOpenDebate.com in the week leading up to the debate, attracting 410,000 votes from across the country, including more than 84,000 in Florida. Debate moderators Cenk Uygur, co-host of the YouTube news channel The Young Turks, and Benny Johnson, creative director of Independent Journal Review, drew from the top 30 questions that received the most votes from Florida residents.
The bottom-up format led to a serious mix of issues, albeit one that skewed left. Social Security, campaign finance reform, climate change, and voting rights factored among the most popular questions. That could be due to a combination of the demographics of users and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the Coalitions backers, doing a better job than conservative groups in promoting the platform and encouraging participation.
We need conservatives to begin to warm to this type of format and to participate as well, Jolly told The Atlantics Russell Berman this week, adding, Whether the questions come from the left or the right, if youre standing as a candidate for the United States Senate, you should be able to answer whatever questions come your way.
Which Jolly and Grayson did, in an amicable way, for 75 minutes. Candidates were told they would have one minute to respond to questions and 45 seconds for follow-ups, yet no one was cut off, and the tone between the moderators and the candidates remained more cordial than confrontational.
The first question, on campaign finance reform, opened the door for Jolly to discuss the Stop Act he introduced, which prohibits members of Congress from directly soliciting campaign contributions. Uygur followed up, asking whether someone else could make the calls to donorsthe first of several times he would push to ensure the candidates fully answered the voters questions.
The moderators also occasionally broadened the questions by providing supporting information or context that helped viewers to better understand the issues. For the most part, their role strengthened the debate, though there were a couple of moments, particularly around discussion of funding for Planned Parenthood, where Johnson unnecessarily added his own opinion. When Grayson protested the accuracy of Johnsons remark, Johnson told him to tweet at him afterward. But Grayson persisted, and ultimately was allowed to deliver a forceful response.
The debate took place at the WUCF studio on the University of Central Florida campus and was streamed live across multiple internet platforms, including FloridaOpenDebate.com. Organizers counted 81,000 live viewers. The video has 99,000 viewers and counting on The Young Turks YouTube channel. An open video feed allowed any website or TV station to broadcast high-quality debate footage live or after the debate, and it has since aired twice on C-SPAN 2.
The voting period was cut off at noon on Monday, allowing the moderators time to make selections. They read questions out loud unless there was a video submission or the person whose question was chosen (or a surrogate) was in the studio. In a pre-recorded video, the actor Mark Ruffalo, an environmental activist, discussed the benefits of renewable energy in Florida before introducing this question from a Rhode Island resident: Do you accept that climate change is the single greatest threat our world faces?
Grayson said yes. Jolly said the bigger threat are people who want to destroy the United States of America tomorrow, one of the few references to terrorism in a debate that stayed tightly focused on domestic issues and steered clear of the horse race.
Im really happy that finally the American people get to see what its like to have two serious members of Congress struggling with the great issues of the day, Grayson said during closing statements. This is the way politics ought to be. 
People posting to Twitter during the debate mostly seemed to agree. 
#OpenDebate by Alan Grayson & David Jolly is getting rave reviews. Any chance this is the model of debates 4 next decade?

There was a definite contrast between this debate and the two town halls MSNBC was holding that same evening with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. In separate interviews, both were asked all-too-familiar campaign questions: For Sanders, it was about endorsing Clinton and encouraging his supporters to back her if shes the nominee; for Clinton, it was about a role for Sanders if shes in the White House.
It kind of makes you wish there had been a vote.

A satirical essay by Rurik Bradbury skewering media critic and journalism professor Jeff Jarvis and his enthusiasm for new media and innovation caused so much uproarmostly for not being well-labeled as satirethat Esquire took it down, as Peter Sterne reported for Politico Media. Gawker has republished the essay Why Im Joining the Innovation Party in full with an explanation of the circumstances. Its funny, but at times the buzzwords sounds all too familiar. The Innovation Party will be phablet-first, and communicate only via push notifications to smartphones. The only deals it cuts will be with Apple and Google, not with special interests, writes fake Jeff Jarvis. He continues, The Innovation Party will post its manifesto on Medium, and it will carefully read all Genius annotations about its policies, to make sure it stays accountable and truly enacts the will of the people.


Gawkers Alex Pareene also got in on the action, taking Jim Vandeheis suggestion in the Wall Street Journal that we support a third-party candidate to its natural conclusion: that there should be a military coup supported by titans of the tech industry. After all, If were going to disrupt government, lets really disrupt it.

In just the past 16 years, Donald Trump has been sued 72 times in federal courtand those are just the ones against him personally, not one of his companies, Chris Dolmetsch, Sophia Pearson, and others report for Bloomberg.

The piece includes an interesting discussion on what it means to be a smart citizen, and whether we dont lose something when systems enable an automated performance of citizenship. This brings Mattern to civic engagement platforms. I think, surprise surprise, that she is too quick to dismiss them as superficial interventions at best or to ascribe them nefarious qualities at worst, but she raises some excellent points about who decides what these platforms do and how they do it. As it applies to Hudson Yards, she suggests that in such a meticulously planned community there is no space for co-designing with users or for meaningful citizen participation in creating the smart technologies that will define Hudson Yards.

The angry, fetid tenements of the Lower East Side were worse than anything Tateh and his wife suffered in Latvia. The Little Girl was often sick now. Tateh wrapped her in his prayer shawl. What rabbi would disapprove?!

As a Jew myself, these words from the musical Ragtime really strike a chord. My ancestors were also given a cold welcome to America. Like many other Jews, they fled pogroms from eastern Europe. One such immigrant from Kiev was Ida Katharske, the mother of Joseph Shuster. Shuster and Jerry Siegelwhose parents also came to the U.S. from Russiabecame best friends growing up in Cleveland: fooling around, writing science fiction stories together.
With parents persecuted as strangers in a strange land, Shuster and Siegel were shaped by their experience as the children of immigrants.
Obviously, it wasnt only Jewish immigrants who endured such hardship. It was all immigrants from every corner of the world. But Shuster and Siegel tapped into their personal experience to create a story about an immigrant who would literally rise above all of this persecution. They gave him a Hebrew-ish name Kal-El (which could be translated as voice of God) and an English name that is still more famous than Harry Potter, James Bond, or Dorothy: Superman.
The introduction of Superman in 1938 turned the burgeoning comic book industry upside down. As Grant Morrison wrote in his bestselling book Supergods: What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human, every comic book company soon tried to imitate their formula.
Morrison is one of many scholars who argue that all modern superhero stories originate from these two Jewish immigrant kids and their invention of Superman. These young men had tapped into something very deep; and it was contagious because it came out of the imagination of all of us who have been poor, tired, and yearning to breathe free.
Perhaps Supermans most interesting role in our culture these days is that he is considered as American as apple pie, as he fights for truth, justice, and the American Way.
A Filipino Clark Kent puts on a new uniform
In 2011, my friend Jose Antonio Vargas decided to end his silence about his own undocumented status. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at the Washington Post, not terribly different than the reputable journalist Clark Kent at the Daily Planet, Jose left his Fortress of Solitude and came out to the world as undocumented. He has since said that when he came out as an undocumented American, he wasnt actually coming out, but letting everyone else in.
Inspired by Jose, a young DREAM activist named Julian Gomez came out (or let others in) on the Harry Potter Alliances (HPAs) YouTube channel as a Muggleborn American. The HPA, where I was then executive director, was inspired to start a campaign around Julians actions. And thats when I thought of Superman.
Another volunteer reminded me that the film Man of Steel was soon coming out, and DREAM activists had for some time already been drawing a parallel between Superman and themselves. So the HPA partnered with Define American, an organization that Jose co-founded with his best friend, a dear friend of mine, and so many at Civic Hall: the late Jake Brewer.
Superman Is An Immigrant received some wonderful earned media that helped tell an empowered narrative around immigration while anti-immigration activists talked about our campaign like we had trapped them into a corner. Eventually, I worked with an education specialist who created a series of amazing lesson plans for teachers around Superman as an Immigrant.
Timing Is everything
With the film Batman vs. Superman scheduled to premier this year, I worked with Define Americans executive director Ryan Eller and Julian (who now works full time at Define American) to revive the Superman Is An Immigrant campaign in advance of the films release. But the movie flopped big timean ever-present risk of cultural activism.
Cultural activism is like comedy: timing is everything.
Had people been excited, had the film been awesome, we would have had a better shot at promoting our ongoing effort: Superman Is An Immigrant.
Last year, I defined cultural activism as cultural acupuncture:
We dream at night, but our culture dreams through books and movies and stories. Working with those stories is cultural dream work. Working with stories that we put energy into is cultural acupuncture. And that is where I hope to focus my work as Civic Halls first Civic Imagination Fellow.
In cultural acupuncture, we find where the psychological energy is in the culture, and move that energy towards creating a healthier body for our world. In cultural acupuncture, stories are the proverbial needles; stories are what resonate. Stories are what can expand our civic imagination and allow us a transformed sense of agency.
For ten years, I practiced cultural acupuncture within the context of the HPA. I created and led dozens of campaigns. For every campaign that was a hit, there were at least three that missed.
But the misses didnt matter. The primary goal of the HPA had been to build an authentic community of fan activists. Every time a cultural campaign did not work, our community learned from it.
Working more on my own as part of my civic imagination fellowship has exposed a major weakness in cultural acupuncture: when you substitute community with campaigns you can still succeed, but each failure feels more significant.
As Civic Halls civic imagination fellow, Ive been working on projects like the Back to the Future Campaign, the US Rebel Alliance, and Superman Is An Immigrant (there have been others but they had a more direct partnership with the HPA, such as Odds In Our Favor). Each time, I have played with the concept of cultural acupuncture on the faith that these experiments could work without a giant community supporting it. Its been a mixed bag.
Throughout the year, Ive wondered what Ive been missing with these campaigns and time and again Ive come to the same conclusion: even though the HPAs campaigns are based on the power of story, they are also centered around a community. Ive often pontificated about the power of story, how all of us are hungry for the magic and meaning that we receive from a good one. But what I am currently finding is that we are even more hungry for the magic and meaning of community.
So how has this changed how I work? Instead of carrying out big stunts like giving Ted Cruz a lightsaber as part of the US Rebel Alliance campaign, I have decided to start working with the Star Wars fan community, listening to those with an ear to the ground who are actually waking up thinking about Star Wars with the same authentic earnestness that I used to wake up thinking about Harry Potter.
Thats how we arrived at a new, heart-driven initiative in partnership with Star Wars fan leaders called #teachmeyoudid.
Since my 2011 TEDx talk in Rome, I have been saying the same thing over and over again: Fantasy is not an escape from our world but an invitation to go deeper into it. But fantasy alone cannot get us there. Our immigrants are not striking out on their own to create a story of success and they never have. There is no Superman outside of the super communities that imagine him.
If my ongoing experiments in increasing our civic imagination have taught me anything, its that the hook for parallels from a story alone does not build a better world. We need communities that believe in stories. And when the story is done badly, as it was in the recent Batman versus Superman film, theres no there, there.
Hamilton was an immigrant and thats a BFD
Instead of letting our pro-immigration campaign fall to the wayside, we are currently looking for other important cultural touchstones to rally around, to make the campaign bigger than Superman. These ideas are still in development, but we dont have to look too hard: The TV shows Fresh Off the Boat and Supergirl both push a pro-immigration message, and have enthusiastic fan bases.
In the new Broadway musical about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, On Your Feet!, the audience cheers when an angry Mr. Estefan rebuked a hostile record company executive, saying, You should look very closely at my face, because whether you know it or not ... this is what an American looks like.
But the multicultural musical juggernaut Hamilton is perhaps the most important cultural rallying point of all. The lyric Immigrants/We get the job done, is such a reliable applause line that the creators have lengthened the pause that follows to allow time for the sound to die down.
In over ten years of working with fan communities Ive developed a sixth sense for fandom. Its all Hamilton!

Many friends have looked at me with skepticism. How can Hamilton be the answer when a Broadway show is so limited to those who get to New York City? These friends of mine are not paying attention. When I go to a Harry Potter event, people would rather talk about Hamilton more than Harry Potter. Our most popular video for the Rebel Alliance is easily our Hamilton parody.
Making the most of the fandom around Hamilton
I think Lin-Manuel Miranda would be proud to watch fans of Hamilton use hip hop and the shows symbolism to argue for immigration reform. Fan activists could encourage him to do a #Ham4Immigrants performance outside the Richard Rogers theater during Ham4Ham. After all, Hes in the harbor now, see if you can spot him. Another immigrant coming up from the bottom....
In a world where life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness feels upside down for so many people, it is the sworn duty of the cultural acupuncturist to move with the energy. And if and when we lose our sense of it, to get back on track with great agility: faster than a speeding bullet; more powerful than a locomotive; able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. We are not birds, we are not planes. Nor do we fly on our own magical energy. We are cultural acupuncturists. And when we allow our hearts to align with the energy in our culture, we can help our world soar like Superman.

We need a movement party thats decentralized, that many people can identify with, organizationally and individually, 350.org organizer Yong Jung Cho tells Rolling Stones Kate Aronoff for her story on the future of the Sanders revolutionwhich Aronoff says will include protests regardless of who wins the presidency, a side effect of the disillusionment that followed Obamas win. But beyond the next presidency, Cho and others want to see a new, open-source, progressive party. And, it seems as if a bit of the hope from eight years ago has returned. Occupy Wall Street veteran and Sanders organizer Winnie Wong tells Aronoff, The cynicism that came from the radical left when we first launched this campaign has dissipated...If anything, the radical left have learned a lot from him.

Theyre pitching the idea to the Bernie movement and will then proceed to start recruiting candidatesproven servants to their communities, families, friends who have consistently passed on opportunities to sell outand then start campaigning across the country until the 2018 midterm election. Even if the replace-Congress concept is gimmicky, the idea of ramping up political engagement ahead of a non-presidential election is really interesting, and shows that progressive political organizers are learning from the mistakes of the past, when they let the air out of the movement after Obama took office and voter turnout at the midterms plummeted.

Writing in the New York Times opinion section, Daphne Keller and Bruce D. Brown warn against the potential for splinternets if governments force websites like Google to show altered results within their borders, as the right to be forgotten privacy laws in Europe demand.

First Post 







I am, for my sins, one of the many parents of the strange beast that is the open data movement. I was one of the first people to nag politicians about the value of opening up public data in machine readable ways. Im one of the first people who actually wrote policy papers on the topic, for a real life government. And I was in California in 2007 when a group of like-minded people drafted the Open Data Principles. Just like LCD Soundsystem, I was, indeed, there.
So, how do I feel about it all now, eight and a half years on from the Open Data Principles? Not good. Ive watched the government of the country I live in sell off our national addressing database, a breathtakingly moronic move that more than undoes the sum and total of good works done in the same time period. And Ive watched that same government tacitly endorse attempts to kneecap our Freedom of Information law, whilst simultaneously grinning and waving a flag labeled most transparent government in the world.
Elsewhere, Ive watched countries that dont have a lot of spare money pay to launch open data portals that then languish, unloved. Which isnt to say poor countries shouldnt release crucial datathey should for their own goodbut the drive to open up the data of poorer countries doesnt appear to be yielding great results.
Perhaps most importantly, and worryingly, Ive not seen any meaningful attempt to systematically overhaul procurement rules to ensure that new government computer systems produce decent open data by default. This omission is especially important since building open data feeds into new government computer systems remains the only way that most government data will ever get released cheaply, quickly, and in appropriate formats. Factories and power stations only pump out less rubbish when the law says they must, and the same is true of government computer systems. International progress on that front so far? Somewhere between dismal and undetectable.
At this point I need to be clear about something: I have not lost faith in open data. The idea that important government data should be generally available in freely-licensed, machine-readable ways is about as controversial as the idea that popes should be Catholic. But progress towards a world in which most public data that needs to be open is seamlessly pumped out as part of Business As Usual has been so sporadic as to raise significant questions about whether the open data movement can truly be said to be winning. If anything, progress reminds me of the numerous token gestures that British governments made in the 19th and 20th centuries to appease women about their disgraceful lack of a vote, whilst continually kicking actual enfranchisement laws into the long grass. There was no business case or water-tight economic case for voter rights, either.
The Politeness Problem
There are many reasons why progress has been sporadic. People often point to the lack of a robust business case to justify either why new spending is justifiable or new laws are worth introducing, in the name of open data. Many people also blame governments for simply not wanting to be open, but that feels a bit like blaming sheep for having woolen coats. What I want to highlight is a different problem, a problem that we in the open data community must own up to because we could have done something about it: we have been entirely too polite for our own good.
Whats wrong with being polite? you might reasonably ask. Isnt it what we train our children to be? Isnt it what we appreciate in other people? Isnt it the only way to get meetings with key political contacts?
Now, this is clearly true, to an extent. There are certain kinds of policy change that you can only push through by just being terribly nice and reasonable about it. Jamie Olivers recent sugar tax victory in the U.K. is one example, and the U.S. Magnitsky Act is another. In these cases, the demon being fought is relatively cost-free to oppose and relatively unpopular with the wider public, making politicians of all stripes feel relatively easy about taking a kick.
This isnt at all the case for most laws, and it is especially untrue for transparency legislation. Transparency laws are like babies: Theres no way to get a real one without someone somewhere having to go through a very unpleasant experience that theyd really do almost anything to avoid. And as a consequence, meaningful transparency laws dont get implemented except in situations where legislators fear something even worse than the effects of more transparency.
If you dont believe me, consider the following examples.
In Britain, we did not gain the right to see our Member of Parliaments expenses until Heather Brooke forced out a scandal so enormous that four MPs were actually sent to jail. Just in the last two weeks we appear (in a vaguely codified way) to have won the right to see our leaders tax returnsbut only after a week in which the press savaged the Prime Minister daily over his connections to off-shore finances co-ordinated by his father. The pain required to produce this concession could literally be seen on David Camerons face as he was forced to face the issue.
This connection between significant political pain and transparency improvements is not unique to Britain. In Hamburg, Germany, the government recently introduced a powerful new transparency law. Its a real doozy, and includes things that have long been on the hit list of open government advocates elsewhere, like ensuring that companies that are part-owned by the state arent exempt from FOIA requests.
How did this Hamburg law come about? A major concert hall went wildly over-budget, and in response a local group managed to force through a referendum demanding a powerful new transparency law to prevent this sort of failure again in the future. The local government didnt support the referendum, but they saw which way the political wind was blowing and realized that changing their position to be in favor was more in their long-term interests than fighting against it and losing the vote anyway.
Hamburgs isnt the only example in Germany of transparency laws emerging from full-blown political crises. In other cities, fury around dodgy water company contracts and other major infrastructure projects have created the kind of political moments that either lead to successful FOIA referendums, or to politicians voting for transparency laws they theyd actually rather oppose.
Last, consider FOIA law in the U.S. In the U.S. constitutional context this law best is best seen as something done by one branch of government (legislative) to another branch that it habitually hates and fears (executive). Presidents, being the head of the executive branch, have shown almost uniform dislike and reluctance to adopt or expand FOIA. It started with Lyndon Johnsons original deep skepticism, progressed to Gerald Fords veto of an improvement in 1974, then to Reagan and Bush IIs clamp down on responses, and thenperhaps most hypocritically of allObamas secret lobbying to prevent further improvements to the law in 2014. In the U.S., transparency has only advanced significantly when the right level of congressional fear and naked political opportunism have aligned, and one branch has essentially used it as a weapon against another. The fact that Congress itself is exempt from FOI is merely an application of the old saw that one ought not to make ones toilette where one dines.
Why point this out now?
In any country at any point in time there are only a limited number of transparency campaigners and activists. And in both the U.S. and the U.K. many of those people, including myself, chose to adopt a collaborative, non-hostile relationship with governments when they first started to consider open data around 2008  2010. In many countries, we were listened to, encouraged to write policy, and given lots of time and attention.
Ultimately this resulted in part of the transparency advocacy community ending up a bit like a caged bear, tamed by a zookeeper through the feeding of endless tidbits and snacks. And like the bear, by the end of the process we found ourselves somewhat sleepy and contented, but with what we really care about (freedom and most of the really important data) still firmly locked up in a cage.
I now realize that I was wrong with my original strategy of working in a constructive, friendly way with two back-to-back British governments, run by different political parties. Meaningful transparency is only ever beaten out of governments with a stick made of pure power politics. In particular, transparency reforms only really happen when key parts of the governing elite have screwed up and done wildly unpopular things; these are the moments where strong laws can get rammed through, when leaders feel a real desperate need to be seen to be doing something.
One of my transparency heroes, Ellen Miller, the now-retired founding director of the Sunlight Foundation, knew the value of an oppositional stance when it comes to transparency laws, and occasionally got grief from U.S. government officials for not being more loudly, conspicuously grateful for their open data initiatives. She was right to stay tough and demanding, something Ill freely admit I didnt fully see at the time.
So, finally, my paradoxical conclusion is this: As long as significant numbers of transparency advocates are engaged constructively on the business of getting open data releases out, the pace of significant transparency reforms will be slowed. Overly-friendly collaboration between governments and transparency advocates sucks the oxygen out of the room. And we need that oxygen to fuel the fires that can burn down the doors to the state, and to parasitic organizations like anonymous shell companies that are dependent upon inaction by the state.

Tech and politics: According to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), speaking at a Civic Hall Innovation Breakfast this morning, the most tech-savvy senator is his colleague Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). He also disclosed that Tim Cook of Apple held a fundraiser for him last year in Palo Alto, which was highlighted by his pulling out his ancient flip-phone, to everyones amazement and amusement. The audience of tech entrepreneurs and civic activists applauded his support for net neutrality, along with his efforts to boost local tech start-ups like the Nerd Bus, which will connect the tech triangle in Brooklyn with neighborhoods in Williamsburg and the new Cornell Technion campus.


Asked by Errol Louis of NY1 for his position on the encryption debate roiling Washington, Schumer said theres got to be a way for both sides to sit down and come up with something. He warned that a terrorist attack could lead to a rush to legislate a crackdown on encryptions use, and called for more effort to find a technological or values-based compromise. There are many more discussions today between leaders of the FBI and national security and leaders of the tech industry [on this topic], he added.

First Post 



Questions for presidential candidates have come from Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter this election cycle, but none of the primary debates focused entirely on issues determined by the public.
The first debate on a national stage to do so will take place this Monday night, when two U.S. Senate candidates in Florida, Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. David Jolly, go head-to-head in an open debate, fielding questions from the public. The event will be hosted by the Open Debate Coalition, which has been working for the past eight years on increasing public involvement.

Anyone can submit and vote on questions for the candidates at FloridaOpenDebate.com up until 12 p.m. eastern on Monday, though only questions submitted by Floridians will be considered for the live debate. The hour-long debate, which can be viewed at the same URL, starts at 7 p.m.
Besides the fact that voters outside of Florida have an interest in who wins a U.S. senate race, Lilia Tamm, the Coalitions program director, said organizers are inviting questions from around the country to build an understanding of and enthusiasm for open debates.
The more that we have people asking for this in different races and in different states, up and down the ballot, the more that we have the ability to give that voice to people, she said. But it really requires a certain level of people being brought into the idea.
Their participation also has a substantive impact. The vote tallies on the site reflect the overall national numbers, so every vote cast can affect which questions are trending or most seen on the site, thereby influencing the questions Florida voters see and vote on most, Tamm added.
The debate is also notable for bringing together candidates from opposing parties ahead of the actual primary election, which is set for Aug. 30. The race for the open Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio has attracted a lot of interest, yet two political veteransGrayson, a Democrat who represents Floridas 9th district, and Jolly, a Republican who represents the 13thdecided in March to start holding debates after declaring themselves the front-runners.
.@AlanGrayson just challenged me to statewide policy debates. #ChallengeAccepted
 David Jolly (@DavidJollyFL) March 1, 2016

The Open Debate Coalition approached the candidates and both agreed to the debate format. 
Using the Open Debate Coalition model helps ensure we actually respond to the will of the peopleand not just answer to the whims and wishes of the establishment and special interest agendas, said Grayson in a press statement.
This is a debate over the future of Florida, officiated by the voters, and intended to present two contrasting visions for the future of the country, added Jolly.
The Coalition adopted the participation criteria set by the Commission on Presidential Debates and invited candidates who have reached a 15 percent average in primary polling. Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy was the only other candidate who met the criteria; he declined the invitation.
Debate moderators include Cenk Uygur, co-host of the YouTube news channel The Young Turks, and Benny Johnson, creative director of Independent Journal Review, an online news company based in Alexandria, Va. An open video feed will allow any website or TV station to broadcast the debate.
How Open Debates Work
The first-ever open debate, held in 2013 for a Massachusetts congressional race, attracted more than 1,600 questions, and more than 79,000 votes were cast. As of early Friday morning, nearly 200,000 votes had been cast in the Florida debate, with four days left to go.
The platform for the Florida open debate is similar to the 2013 structure, though the backend has been scaled to handle larger volumes of traffic, and more resources have been dedicated to limit spam and trolling. 
The most important thing for us is to have the site reflect the actual will of the voters, said Tamm, adding that a well-run and safe space for everyone involved is essential to encouraging participation.
Questions fall under one of 10 issue areas, including civil rights, education, economy and jobs, taxes and budget, and society and community. According to the site guidelines, moderators have the right to move questions to a different category and to remove, modify, or combine similarly worded questions. The moderation process is entirely transparent, involving both site users and experts from Coalition organizations.
.@DavidJollyFL and I are accepting questions for our #OpenDebate on 4/25. Vote: https://t.co/wDX9KJUZ8Q pic.twitter.com/0E4qSNrcaX
 Rep. Alan Grayson (@AlanGrayson) April 21, 2016

Authors are notified if changes are made to their submissions, and they can try to clarify their question or request a reversal. In addition, all changes are logged and viewable at floridaopendebate.com/changelog, along with the reason for the change.
Of the nearly 700 questions currently available to be voted on, the most popular onesboth nationally and among Florida votersare about money in politics. Asked about notable questions, Tamm said that while a number of high-quality submissions have come in, theres a bigger issue at play: the ability to change the conversation itself.
Its not so much that any one question is going to be particularly insightful or going to really dig deeper than the news media, she said. I think that the news media does quite a good job of digging deep on a lot of things, and it is their job to know the issues well enough to be able to do so.
What we have as a collectivethe power of the crowdsourcingis the agenda setting. Its saying, were going to give the people the power to decide what areas we want these candidates to be discussing in front of us. And by and large, there are no political questions. Thats the thing thats really different.
Tamm said social media companies that teamed up with networks hosting presidential primary debates did a good job of involving more peoples voices this yearespecially Twitter, which helped CBS integrate a real-time tweet during the Democratic debate in Iowa. But the media still makes the call on which questions to include, which greatly limits the influence the public has on the overall conversation.
And when control of the conversation expands beyond the traditional gatekeeperspolitical parties, media, the Commission on Presidential Debatesthe benefits can be felt by all, said Tamm.
Showing that we not only bring a sense of participation to an audience, but we can actually bring a lot more audience members inbecause they, especially younger people, expect a level of participation from their media experience that a traditional debate does not provideis good for all of the stakeholders involved.
Eight-Year Effort
The Open Debate Coalition was founded in 2008. Today it includes about 50 people and organizations (including Civic Hall co-founders Micah Sifry and Andrew Rasiej) from across the political spectrum. They all endorse a common principle: The public should be empowered to conceive and select debate questionsso that questions addressed by candidates represent the will of the people. 
Tamm, the Coalitions first full-time staff person, said the Coalition has been working to directly involve the public in a presidential debate since its founding and is optimistic 2016 could be the year.
Weve been talking with leadership, she said.
The Coalition submitted proposals six months ago with the hope of nudging the Commission on Presidential Debates toward altering the traditional debate structure, which has remained mostly unchanged for the past decade.
Mike McCurry, co-chairman of the Commission, indicated at a forum on presidential debates last month that questions will be curated from the public, but offered no specifics. 
About Floridas open debate, McCurry said the Commission is especially interested in any experiments or new technologies the Open Debates Coalition employs during the primary season to generate questions from the American public and put themvia a journalist/moderatorto the candidates.
We have a working group exploring many ideas about debate formats, he added, and we hope to build on those things that are working to create a more vibrant public debate.
The ultimate goal, said Tamm, is for open-debate technology to trickle down to other races, including those at the local level. That can more easily be done once a high-profile, national open debate takes place and sets the standard for how these types of events can be run.
This has never been a technology problem, she said, its just the political will and the understanding of the technological space and all the stakeholders lining up and seeing this would be a benefit to them.
And thats been happening more, she said.
The Coalition approached news stations in Orlando and Tampa about hosting next weeks debate, and all deferred, saying they didnt have enough time to pull together a quality production. But many of them were excited about the format, said Tamm, and encouraged the Coalition to try them again. This year, shell take that as a promising response.

Todays tech and politics must-read: Dani McClain writing in The Nation on the distinction between social media savvy figureheads and the actual Black Lives Matter movement:
Twitter feeds constantly updated with smart observations about the latest cause for outrage are a lot more visible than the painstaking meetings that precede a transit-system shutdown, a citywide protest, or a collaboratively written 40-page policy agenda. But understanding the distinction between organizers and amplifiers matters; otherwise, well overrate those who excel at amplifying the passion of a movement and undervalue the organizers, who make concrete change happen.

Voting without illusions: On New Yorks primary night, Micah Sifry has this sobering essay on whats wrong with democracy, and in a word, its voting.

Bernie Sanders rally, Vancouver, WA, March 20, 2016 (Adampdx85)

I voted for Bernie Sanders here in New York because I agree with his focus on addressing inequality and our unjust campaign finance system. But I have a lot of respect for my friends and colleagues who voted for Hillary Clinton. I get their reasoning; and also I get the agonizing many of my leftist feminist friends have been going through.
I also sort of get the vitriolic intensity of the personal attacks flowing between Sanders and Clinton supportersthough its definitely gotten out of control at points. Some of that is obviously the byproduct of online culture: the normal tendency to control your tongue is weakened when your sit safely behind a screen, plus a heaping dose of misogyny doesnt help. And some of it stems from the sense that this presidential election may have historic importance, and that if somehow a far-right ideologue or a neofascist wins the White House, all will be lost. So the stakes seem higher than normal.
But what I dont get is why we obsess so intensively about this single vote, compared to how little attention most of us pay to the many other consequential ways we have of influencing the direction of the country. Most Americanstwo-thirds, according to a 2013 Gallup pollcannot name their own Member of the House of Representatives. Anecdotally, this rings true. After talking with some of my peers about the presidential election, Ive asked them to name their Congressman or woman. And in a number of cases, Ive gotten blank stares, including from well-educated middle-class suburbanites. A September 2014 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that a majority of Americans didnt even know what party controlled Congress.
One of three state legislators run for election without a major party opponent. Thats right: in the so-called greatest democracy in the world, many of us live in de-facto one-party state legislative districts. The state I live in, New York, is riddled with the kind of political corruption that results when there is little electoral competition. For years, it has been governed in reality by three men in a room. That is, the governor, the state assembly majority leader and the state senate majority leader. And yet, theres been no real upswell of anger at this anti-democratic arrangement. Even with the indictment and conviction of the latter two politicians on corruption charges, and the quashing, by our governor, of an anti-corruption commission that might have exposed his own foibles, theres been no meaningful rebellion.
We fight fiercely over this one vote for our nominee for president, and then what? Does rallying for one person do the trick?
What exactly, is the difference between the picture of masses of supporters rallying for Barack Obama in 2008, and the picture of masses of supporters rallying for Bernie Sanders in 2016?
It would be wonderful if all the passionate intensity now on display among Democrats, Republicans, and independents was somehow channeled into meaningful and ongoing mobilizations to hold that president accountable to his or her promises, and to put similar pressure on our lower-level representatives to serve us more effectively.
But for that to happen, we have to understand why relying on voting wont do the job alone. In fact, as its currently constituted its an absolutely miserable way to ensure that we the people are truly represented, while it is an excellent way to concentrate power in the hands of the wealthy few.
Gaming the System
The game we are all obsessing about, called voting for a leader, doesnt work if its purpose is to actually produce a democracy, which I think most of us would define the way the ancient Greeks defined it, as a system where the people (demos) are in power (cracy = rule by). And yet, every four years, here we are, consumed by the outcome of a process that takes power out of our hands and vests it in the hands of a few people who are by design unrepresentative of us. One might even say that it is in their interest to transfix us so.
As Roslyn Fuller points out in her excellent new book, Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning and Lost Its Purpose, all systems for apportioning power and representation based on voting fail at the job of choosing representative leaders. They fail for two core reasons. The first is mathematical; the second is economic.
First to the mathematical problems. The system for picking our representatives that we use here in America breaks in a variety of troubling ways. The first, obviously, is the patchwork system of voter registration, which in some states is designed to make it harder for people to vote, in some states formally denies the vote to ex-cons who have paid their debts to society, while in others allows people to register easily online or on the same day as an election. The actual electorate is hardly uniformly created across all states. Then add the stupefying fact that a voter in an underpopulated state like Idaho or Vermont gets something like 66 times as much clout in the U.S. Senate as a voter in California. Then add gerrymandering, which in almost every state is a system where elected officials choose their voters (by designing their district lines) before the voters choose them.
Then look at our first-past-the-post system of giving all the representative power to the candidate who gets the most votes. If, by some crazy hypothetical occurrence, every single eligible voter turned out in an election, the people who choose the candidate who gets 50 percent plus one will get 100 percent of the representation, while the 49.99 percent who chose the other candidate will get zero. If, on the other hand, just half of the eligible voters come out, and again one candidate gets 50 percent plus one, three-quarters of the electorate will go unrepresented. Factor in races with more than two candidates, and you can have a politician elected with a minority of the actual votes castbut they get all of the power.
This is a recipe for rancor and disaffection, as the unrepresented half (or more) of the population stews at being shut out of power, while the represented segment behaves as if it has a mandate. Meanwhile, the people who think they won because their candidate won indulge themselves in the illusion that they have been fully empowered, when in fact one person cannot possibly represent hundreds of thousands, let alone millions, in any meaningful way.
(Proportional representation systems fail too, Fuller notes, even though they do a slightly better job of spreading power around. A multi-party system at least insures that most people get some representation in power. But there have been many cases where, thanks to the quirks of how seats are apportioned, a party that gets less than 50 percent of the overall vote manages to get more than 50 percent of the seats. That was the case for Margaret Thatchers Conservative government in the UK in 1983, when her party won less than a third of the total vote but got a majority of the seats in Parliament.)
But coming back to the American system and all the ways that it breaks. Consider the arbitrariness of political parties, which are actually private clubs and do not have to apportion power in their choosing process by any publicly regulated system. (This despite the fact that the state props them up in a variety of ways, including guaranteeing them a line on the ballot, covering the costs of printing those ballots and running the election, and giving them privileged access to the state voter file.)
Right now, some of us are waking up to some of the lesser aspects of the perversity of voting because the rules that our two major parties use for picking a presidential candidate are, shall we say, truly bizarre. In some states, a tiny number of people can show up at a local meeting, harangue each other transparently, and then take an open vote, and the results of that process determine which candidate gets delegates to the partys convention. In others, a winner-take-all rule delivers all the states delegates to just one candidate. And there are the super delegates, who are picked by no voters but have about one-fifth of the seats at the Democratic national convention.
So, to recap, each delegate to the party conventions has one vote, but that vote may stand for anywhere from zero to a few thousand to millions of voters. Right now, as the Upshot points out, a Republican voter living in the Bronx has 46 times the weight in delegates as Republican voters in parts of Illinois, and 29 times the significance as voters in Virginia.
Those are the mathematical problems with relying on voting as the path to democracy. Then consider the economic problem, which is a reality for all representative offices, but the more people a single person represents, the worse the problem gets.
This is where the voting game is rigged so that ordinary voters are almost always destined to lose. The more power is concentrated, the easier it is for those with lots of money to corrupt the system. When America was founded, a Member of the House of Representatives had roughly 40,000 people living in their district. Now that number is about 700,000, which means the average voter today is almost 20 times less represented by their House member than in Americas first years. Meanwhile, because that Member has to communicate with hundreds of thousands of voters, rather than a more manageable 40,000, she needs millions of dollars for her campaigns.
What more perfect way to ensure that our representatives will be targeted by Big Money and corrupted by their dependence on big donors than a system of Big Districts that increase the gap between representatives and their constituents. No wonder political scientists say we live in an oligarchy. The Framers gave us a system with just a few long-serving elected representatives, a short list of targets for the moneyed few to ply. Their fatal error, as Fuller argues in Beasts and Gods, was using the Roman Senate as their model for representation, rather than the Athenian system of mass direct democracy. Given how ancient Rome turned out, she has a point.
We live in a hollowed out system that calls itself a democracy, and fights over the meaning of citizenship to the point of denying it to millions of our neighbors, but that guarantees full participation to only a very few well-connected Americans. We compensate with maddening levels of projection. Watching the candidates speak, we imagine that they speak for us. Is Bernie Sanders different? Obviously his supporters think so, because all his small donations means his campaign is paid for by the people, not the billionaires. Its a start, but barely. Right now, Sanders supporters have as much influence on what he does or says as Hillary Clintons supporters have on her. But at least Clinton supporters have no illusions about that deal.

What does 19th century food adulteration have to do with online harassment? Everything, argues J. Nathan Matias in this Guardian piece that outlines the history of food regulation in the wake of industrialization, and how people working to solve social problems online can learn from their fight against food adulteration. A big problem is that most ongoing research on harassment and comment moderation is happening out of sight: companies retain their research as a trade secret, and academics mostly publish in outlets with prohibitive paywalls. Like the Victorian food safety advocates that took matters into their own hands in the 19th century, public advocates for online safety will need, and have already begun, to compile research and solutions of their own, and put pressure on online companies to cooperate.


In response to reports of a $100,000-a-head fundraiser dinner for Hillary Clinton, hosted by George Clooney, Bernie Sanders supporters started organizing potluck dinners around the country to raise money for Bernie Sanders, with an oft-recommended donation of $27, writes Patty Jane on Medium.

#PiliPinas Debates: Claire Jiao of CNN Philippines takes readers behind the scenes of the April 10 vice presidential debate at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, capturing unguarded moments with the six candidates.
It is easy to forget, amid the theater of a nationally televised debate, that these candidates are just people, in the middle of a political circus, writes Jiao.
As with the previous presidential debates, this debate featured more than 100 television ads, according to Rappler, though the ads took up a relatively smaller shareabout 20 percent of the three-hour broadcast. Commercial breaks became a point of contention after ads dominated 48 minutes of the first two-hour presidential debate. 
The final presidential debate, scheduled for April 24 at the University of Pangasinan, will be a town hall format, with questions for the candidates fielded from the audience. The election takes place May 9.
 Rappler is also organizing a series of senatorial debates under the heading #TheLeaderIWant, with questions crowdsourced from the audience, and capturing online sentiment during the debates via a mood meter. Users can indicate whether theyre annoyed, angry, afraid, amused, inspired, sad, or happyor if they just dont care.
Northern Ireland: Representatives of Northern Irelands five main political parties on Wednesday took part in the first televised debate of this years Assembly election. The BBC will host a second leaders debate on May 3, just two days before the May 5 election.

On April 20, first-time voters will be invited to pose questions directly to politicians during a live studio event, Election 2016: The Good Friday Agreement Generation. Reached 18 years ago, the agreement brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict.
U.S. News
Bye #DemDebate: Last nights debate between Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was likely the last primary debate of Election 2016. It was loud and exhaustingfor candidates as well as viewers.
Town Hall is the New Debate: Abigail Abrams of International Business Times takes a closer look at the town hall format, which in recent weeks mostly took the place of multi-candidate debates. There have been more than 30 town halls this election cycle across the major cable networks as well as niche media outlets, compared to just a few in 2012.
It used to be that voters could tune in to a debate one night and have a pretty good sense of where a candidate stood on the issues, said Jennifer Konfrst, head of the strategic political communication department at Drake University in Iowa. Now they have to moderate between these events. Its a more involved and invested process on behalf of voters.
And theyre not necessarily getting more out of it. 
A Pew Research study released in February found that 91 percent of U.S. adults surveyed had learned something new about the 2016 presidential election in the previous week. Konfrst pointed to this study, saying the frequent town halls and the social media conversation around them has made the campaign almost unavoidable. But this doesnt necessarily mean people are well-informed, writes Abrams. 
Its much more a mile wide and an inch deep in terms of voter engagement, said Konfrst.
Old Media is the New Media: New York Times political correspondent Nicholas Confessore explains how he and two other reporters have narrated the presidential primary debates in real time, creating instant live-chats for readers to use as a second screen as they watch the debate.
As the experiment progressed, writes Confessore, we discovered that readers didnt want just a second screen; a large number were watching the debate by reading our chat. So our roles evolved. To put it in sports terms, Maggie [Haberman] and I provide most of the color commentary, while Alan [Rappeport] describes the plays (what the candidates or moderators are saying and doing). That way people who dont have a TV will know what Maggie and I are talking about.
Citizens Ignored: Public Citizen has published a report on how little has been said about campaign finance reform during the presidential primary debates.
According to the report, only 15 of more than 1,000 questions or statements by moderators so far have addressed the U.S. campaign finance system. The term super PACs has been used in only two questions posed by moderators. Citizens United has been invoked only once. (These numbers were published prior to last nights Democratic debate.)
Theres a disconnect between voters and the media, who are not paying attention to something thats front and center for most Americans as never before, Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizens Congress Watch, told NPR. Theyre unwilling to press the candidates on solutions.
The Business of Debates: The Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce is expecting the first presidential debate, scheduled for Sept. 26 at Wright State University, to bring in $25 to $35 million to the region, reports Tristan Navera at the Dayton Business Journal.
Wright State has received 3,300 requests for media credentials so far, said its president, David Hopkins. The school expects 200 million debate viewers. This could well be the most watched presidential debate in the history of debates, Hopkins said.
State Debates: From Baltimore to San Diego, debates are being held for mayoral candidates and other local positions, as well as for district and statewide races. Yet participation is still no guarantee, especially when one candidate is better known and has more to risk.
Former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland has proposed five debates with Republican Sen. Rob Portman in the Ohio U.S. Senate race. Portman campaign spokeswoman Michawn Rich said the proposal comes as a welcome surprise, as Strickland had previously refused to take part in any debates with his primary challenger. Strickland won the Democratic primary handily in March.
In Utah, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert finally engaged in a public debate this week with his primary challenger, Jonathan Johnson, chairman of Overstock.com. Johnson opened the debate opened with this quip: I would like to thank the Utah Foundation of Republican Women for hosting this. Apparently, youre the one group in Utah that nobody can say no to. Republicans will choose their nominee on April 23.

Crypto-wars, continued: Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer explains why the company is suing the U.S. government to stop it from being gagged from telling its customers when their records are being accessed by law enforcement. He writes:
...we appreciate that there are times when secrecy around a government warrant is needed. This is the case, for example, when disclosure of the governments warrant would create a real risk of harm to another individual or when disclosure would allow people to destroy evidence and thwart an investigation. But based on the many secrecy orders we have received, we question whether these orders are grounded in specific facts that truly demand secrecy. To the contrary, it appears that the issuance of secrecy orders has become too routine. ...Over the past 18 months, the U.S. government has required that we maintain secrecy regarding 2,576 legal demands, effectively silencing Microsoft from speaking to customers about warrants or other legal process seeking their data. Notably and even surprisingly, 1,752 of these secrecy orders, or 68 percent of the total, contained no fixed end date at all. This means that we effectively are prohibited forever from telling our customers that the government has obtained their data.

Igor Luksic, Danilo Turk, Natalia Gherman, and Vesna Pusic answer questions in a public debate at Civic Hall. (Jessica McKenzie)
In a historic first, the candidates running to be the next secretary general of the United Nations debated publicly at an event co-hosted by New America and the Guardian at Civic Hall yesterday. The current secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, will step down at the end of the year, and in response to a push from some of the member states for greater openness and transparency, the process this year includes informal dialogues in front of the general assembly of the UN, as well as public debates like the one last night.
Questions had been solicited from the public in advance of the debate in a partnership with Global Citizen and Avaaz, and were put to the candidates by the moderator, the Guardians Mark Rice-Oxley. They included a question about how the candidates would work to meet the new sustainable development goals; how the candidates would protect UN whistleblowers; how to ensure accountability at the UN; and how the UN should respond, if at all, to the refugee crisis in Europe right now.
Four of at least eight candidates participatedVesna Pusic, the former minister of foreign and European affairs of Croatia, Danilo Turk, the former president of Slovenia, Natalia Gherman, the former deputy prime minister of Moldova, and Igor Luksic, deputy prime minister of Montenegro.
Vesna Pusic at one point expressed surprise that so many people had become interested in the United Nations since the process of finding a new secretary general had been opened up. I was surprised to see how many people that have nothing to do with the United Nations got interested in following the procedure, listening to the candidates, Pusic said. Just excited that this process now has some faces.
All four hail from central or eastern Europe, and Rice-Oxley pointed that out, asking if they thought it was their turn in the rotation of regions that the UN has previously observed in the top spot. Although she said that the most qualified person should get the job, Natalia Gherman added that equitable geographic representation was important. Danilo Turk said that 10 years, 20 years ago when they elected someone first from Africa and then from Asia because those regions pushed for it, nobody batted an eye.
In past years the process has been so opaque as to resemble the papal conclave more than a political election, as BBC correspondent Nick Bryant observed. Although the trappings this year all signal increased transparency and a more participatory process, some worry that its all show and no substance. Although the public hearings are a step in the right direction, the Security Council will still meet behind closed doors to choose a candidate for the General Assembly to approve, with no imperative to heed the General Assemblys preferences one way or another. A senior European official in Washington told Politico, at the end of the day, the secretary-general will be chosen by U.S. and Russia and more or less [with] the acceptance of China.
Still, Mogens Lykketoft, president of the General Assembly, remains optimistic. As he told Politico, We dont know what will come out of this...[If theres] a critical mass of countries supporting one of the candidates, then I think it will be very difficult to see a Security Council coming with quite a different name.
Closing the event last night, Thomas Weiss, a professor and a leader of the Future UN Development System project, pointed out that a candidate for secretary general has voluntarily put out an 80-page position platform for the public, another first for the UN. Praising the efforts at transparency, Weiss said: This has already made a difference.

Double Mountain Fork Brazos River, Texas (Wikipedia)

When drought-prone Texas goes dry, the whole world feels it. That, at least, is one takeaway from a New York Times article describing the economic impact of the worst drought in the states history on the world cotton market. In total, the 2011 drought cost local agriculture, the cattle industry, and the tourism industry billions of dollars. Although a five-year-long drought came to an end last year and Texas is enjoying the respite, water issues in the state arent going anywhere, especially if, as predicted, the states population doubles by 2050.
Knowing Texas would have to make some to make some tough decisions about water policy in the coming years, the local chapter of The Nature Conservancy identified a pressing need for good, free, easily-accessible water data, and decided to fill it. Last month they launched a mapping application that incorporates approximately 50 datasets from nearly a dozen different organizations and government agencies. It gives the most complete picture of Texas water available to the public to date.
A project years in the making, the Texas Water Explorer is structured around six factors that impact the states water resourceswater quantity, water quality, ecosystem health, economic productivity, water governance, and water conservationand has 24 indicators, like water use by sector or urban water use efficiency, with more slated to come as the Explorer grows. Conservancy employees told Civicist they hope that the Explorer will be a model for similar projects in other states.

It was a well-timed release, because Texass 2017 State Water Plan (a 50-year plan that is revisited and renewed every five years) is open to public comment until April 25, so interested parties have time to check the Explorer for context before weighing in.
One of the things that you often hear said in Texas, Laura Huffman, director of The Nature Conservancy Texas, told Civicist, is that if everybody simultaneously exercised their legal right to pump water out of the rivers and streams in Texas, wed drain most of them.

Texas groundwater is governed by what is sometimes called the law of the biggest pump: landowners own the groundwater beneath their property, so they can pump as much groundwater on their property as they like, even if it means drying their neighbors well. Individuals, companies, or organizations wanting to use surface waterwater from rivers or streams, for examplemust apply to a state agencies for a water right, but as Huffman pointed out, if everyone takes what is legally theirs, there wouldnt be any left.
If you can drill a well and suck the water out its yours, legally, and that makes sustainable water planning very difficult, says Ryan Smith, an ecologist with The Nature Conservancy Texas who led the Texas Water Explorer project. Theres an ongoing effort on the part of legislators to try to figure out, how do we work within this thing called rule of capture, but still be able to put enough regulation on it to make it sustainable. So there could very well be some major effort on that in the next session or two.
Huffman and Smith hope the Texas Water Explorer will be used to make more informed decisions around water issues going forward. That is one reason, Huffman told Civicist, that the Explorer doesnt include any kind of editorial analysis. An about page for the tool states, This website summarizes and maps important information to help you understand Texas water without asserting any causal links to Texas freshwater challenges.
Ill give you an example of why, Huffman said, explaining the Conservancys reasoning behind this. If you look at water conservation numbersif there is an area thats using 150 gallons per person or per capita, is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? Thats open for interpretation. We didnt want to come up with universal interpretations for what that data meant, because we want it to be used for decision-makers.
If we had come up with a set of 15 conclusions about what the database meant, she continued, then we concluded that it might get less attention from decision makers, because conclusions had already been reached, and then wed be arguing over whether they were the correct conclusions.

Without that bit of guidance, howeveroh see look here now this is interesting and importantthe Texas Water Explorer is frankly overwhelming for a Texas-water amateur, in spite of several videos the Conservancy has produced explaining how to use the Explorer.
However, Luke Metzger, director of the advocacy project Environment Texas, assures Civicist that the Texas Water Explorer is an important resource for activists working on water issues in the state.
Even as experienced advocates we wouldnt have known to find or where to look for some of these datasets, Metzger said.
Finding who owned the needed information and where it was stored and how to get it was the projects first task. Contributing organizations include state agencies, like the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Comptroller of Public Accounts; universities, including Texas A&M and Michigan State; and federal agencies like the U.S. Geological survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Even though there might have been ways for the public to get to some of this datathrough public records or whatevernot all of it even sat on public databases, Laura Huffman, director of The Nature Conservancy Texas, told Civicist. The practical answer is no, you could not have looked at this information before. It just would have taken too much effort.
Metzger said he was glad to see that water efficiency in electricity generation was one of the indicators, although he added that it would be nice if renewable energy companies were also included, to make it easier to advocate for clean energy.
Ryan Smith told Civicist that existing datasets in the Explorer will be updated when new information becomes available, and that they have plans to add additional indicators, including native fish surveys (Smith originally specialized in fish biology). He also said that some people have already reached out through email with suggestions for datasets to add.
Since the Explorer is meant to grow over time, I asked Metzger what data he would like to see added in the future. TRI data on toxic releases to water, sewage spills, and proposed projects in the State Water Plan, he replied.
The Texas Water Explorer was funded by several foundations, including the Lennox Foundation, The Meadows Foundation, and the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation (George Mitchell was known as the father of fracking). A number of agencies, universities, and NGOs were a part of the advisory council, including the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment, the National Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club, Lone Star Chapter, the Southwest Research Institute, the Texas Water Foundation, and the Texas Water Resources Institute.
The Nature Conservancy already has a project in Louisiana and Mississippi called the Freshwater Network, which has similar goals to the Texas Water Explorer, but theyd like to see the Explorer model take off in other states as well. After four years of drought and counting, California would seem a ripe prospect for such an open data project. The state has already imposed mandatory water restrictions, but more information is never amiss, especially when the brunt of the restrictions fall on the less affluent. The drought has inspired some drought-specific visualizations, but nothing approaching the breadth and depth of the Texas Water Explorer.

Were thrilled to announce that the theme of Personal Democracy Forum 2016 is The Tech We Need. There are some amazing mainstage talks to look forward to, but were also still filling up the afternoon panel discussions, so if youd like to pitch one you can learn how to do so here.


Writing for Technical.ly Philly, Juliana Reyes digs in on why a civic tech engineer left Philadelphia city government for an adtech firm.

Workshop on Build With, Not For civic tech at Personal Democracy Forum 2015
The theme of Personal Democracy Forum 2016, our thirteenth annual gathering, is The Tech We Need.
From our neighborhoods and our cities, to our governments, our society and our environmentall of them need our help. But technology, as the historian Melvin Kranzberg memorably put it, is neither good nor bad in how it affects our world. Nor is it neutral. So we are going to come at this question of The Tech We Need from several inter-related angles, including looking at what we dont need, and whether what we need is something beyond what we ordinarily think of as tech.
Heres a taste of what to expect from this years plenary program, with some examples drawn from our exciting array of main hall keynoters.
All human activity starts with intention and capacity. What do we decide to pay attention to and why? How much capacity do we have for action? What enables us? What constrains us? Todays connection technologies are radically changing how we personally and collectively attend to what matters, but they do so in the context of older structures, some good and some bad. For Sherry Turkle, an esteemed keynote speaker who is making her first appearance at PDF, the issue is how todays communications tools are not just altering what we pay attention to, but also the danger that they are undermining our capacity for empathy. Shell offer a clear warning about the risks of believing that we can code our machines to solve for feelings. For danah boyd, a keynoter were excited to be welcoming back to the PDF stage, the issue is understanding the hidden trade-offs at work as we race ahead to adopt new technologies without unpacking their environmental, societal and political consequences. For Alicia Garza, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, who we are thrilled to be welcoming to PDF, the larger issue to focus on is what it means to be a full participant in democracy, and whether we agree about what we mean by democracy.
Creative human activity also requires freedom, the freedom to express ourselves and the freedom to connect in common purpose. Todays connection technologies are radically amplifying the power of small and large groups alike, sometimes with liberating effects, but also with new, unintended and undesirable consequences. Is our ability to speak and to organize changed when we lack privacy? In an age of ubiquitous social media, is it better to be so visible? What about the ways that todays technologies are reinforcing domination? Anil Dash of ThinkUp and Yvette Alberdingk Thijm of Witness both have long experience with the paradoxical power of online amplification. Their talks will explore the often-ignored human side of using the internet to challenge injustice. Privacy researcher Kate Crawford of Microsoft will cover how tech designers are just beginning to bake security into their tools, while technologist and documentary-maker Josh Klein will report on the chilling ways that Chinas government is using social media to foster social control. Esraa Al-Shafei of Majal.org will share her organizations hard-won experience of building locally-resonant tech for human rights work in the Middle East, rather than relying on imported solutions. Hossein Derakshan, who helped kickstart the rise of blogging in Iran, was in prison as social networking overtook the open web. Now free again, hes asking hard questions about whether weve lost the web we need. Safira Noble, a rising scholar at UCLA, will challenge our reliance on algorithms that organize our information but also subtly reinforce old patterns of oppression.
Thanks to todays technologies, it has obviously become much easier to participate in the public conversation. But more and more, we seem to be overloaded by inputs and whipsawed by spectacles. What tools and practices can make us better at large-scale community coordination? Can we design tech that spurs more empathy and less polarization? Can our organizations learn to make use of tech in ways that are more inclusive and productive? Thankfully, we are starting to see a bumper crop of promising new tools and platforms emerging that are answering these questions in innovative ways. Well hear from Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian democracy activist who started Parlio, a platform for civil discussion online; Perry Rosenstein of Hustle, the text-based mobilization tool that is quietly powering all of the presidential campaigns; Amanda Rose, the founder of Twestival who has now built Timecounts to help volunteers self-organize more easily; Andrew Konya, the founder of Remesh, a mass conversation tool; and neuroscientist Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, who will share insights from brain science into how we better channel our attention productively. Turning to the challenge of how techies actually work themselves, digital strategist Alia McKee will explore what we have to do to be self-sustaining, and for everyone who is struggling to figure out how to better integrate tech inside their organizations, Sam Dorman, an advisor to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Alliance and Greenpeace, will share some powerful insights on how digital teams can work best.
The tech we need is also about the tech that helps us become a collective we more effectively. At one level this is tech that makes our government work better, since government is the central vehicle that enables we the people to achieve common goods. Here, speakers like Robin Carnahan of 18F, Ron Bouganim of the Govtech Fund, and Kristin Soltis Anderson of Echelon Insights, will offer talks focused on why the basic process of modernizing government services for the digital age is such a critical issue, from wherever you sit on the political spectrum. Stacy Donohue of the Omidyar Network will share fresh findings on the state of civic tech, while tech critic Kentaro Toyama will offer some sobering warnings about why the best laid plans of tech-powered reformers often go awry.
Of course, we come together in more ways than just as clients of government. We are also active participants in discussing and changing the priorities of public action. Thats where the role of tech in campaigns and movementsa longstanding theme of PDFwill be engaged by talks from the likes of Zack Exley, a national organizing advisor to the Bernie Sanders campaign; Mariana Ruiz Firmat and Jackie Mahendra of the Kairos Project, which is training a new generation of campaigners of color; Erin Vilardi of VoteRunLead, which is using digital platforms to galvanize a wave of new women candidates for office; and Jason Mogus, a longtime digital strategist focused on networked advocacy.
Finally, as the future comes barreling forward toward us, well look at how work and the economy being changed by tech and perhaps can be changed by us. Nick Grossman of Union Square Ventures will share his vision of self-regulating businesses, while Natalie Foster of the Institute for the Future will explore the prospects for a universal basic income. And media theorist Douglas Rushkoff will ask whether we can program a different economic system with tech that serves all of us rather than just a few.
While we have a packed and provocative series of talks planned for the main hall, many of the richest interactions at Personal Democracy Forum happen in and around the breakout sessions. If youd like to propose a session, heres how. Panel submissions are open until the end of April, with responses on a rolling basis.
Tickets for #PDF16 are still available at our early-bird rates.

This is civic tech: If you are an open data geek or just someone who wants to understand the intricacies of making open data more relevant and useful in the context of a big city like New York, dont miss Kaela Sanborn-Hums detailed report in the Gotham Gazette on the state of the citys open data portal and Mayor Bill de Blasios Open Data for All plan.


Civicist senior editor Tom Steinberg writes that its time to be honest about civic tech projects that can pay their own way, and those that cant. Not every civic tech project can be a Change.org or a NationBuilder with a clear business model; some simply wont be paid for by the marketplace. He gives two very important reasons: it will stop impactful-but-not-profitable ideas being distorted into impactless-but-possibly-profitable ideas and governments and funders must not be allowed to live with the illusion that theres something magical about civic tech, some voodoo that will allow us to have amazing public goods for zero ongoing public or philanthropic costs.


Joshua Tauberer, the longtime founder and proprietor of GovTrack.us, responds that he agrees with Steinberg, but that it was always his impression that civic techies valued nonprofits over projects (like his) that manage to be self-sustaining by charging fees.


BetaNYC is looking to hire a short-term hackathon manager.


Tech and politics: Hillary Clintons campaign is looking to add more muscle to its social media efforts, shifting longtime Clinton aide Katie Dowd from her position as digital director into a new senior adviser role focused on building Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clintons online presence, Evan McMorris-Santoro reports for BuzzFeed. Jenna Lowenstein will move from being Dowds deputy to being full-time digital director.


While Donald Trump has a fan base on Reddit, his campaign isnt doing much with it beyond occasionally picking up a social media meme or viral video generated there, John Herrman of the New York Times reports. Some guy named Sifry adds context.


Crypto-wars, continued: Theres classified, and then theres classified, President Obama told Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday in explaining why he didnt believe former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did any damage to U.S. national security in running work emails through her private email server. Theres stuff that is really top-secret, top-secret, and theres stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of state, that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open-source, the President said.

As a recovering academic, I spend more time than I should going down rabbit holes: reading articles which cite interesting studies, which I then go find and read, and then they cite interesting papers, and pretty soon way too much time has gone by. Im currently researching the role of civic technology projects enacted by U.S cities for mySociety, so Ive been actively looking for those civic tech rabbit holes.
Theres just one hitch: civic technology barely exists in the academic context. E-government, on the other hand, continues to have an active research program.
Searching e-government in Google Scholar returns 169,000 cited works10,600 published since 2015 alone. Searching civic technology, meanwhile, nets a total of 185. (And one of the top results references technology in the Honda Civic.)
This disparity prompts a few questions. First, from a research perspective: should those of us conducting research on civic technology acknowledge that were actually researching an aspect of e-government? Does civic technology fit within the e-government research agenda?
Second, from the perspective of the civic tech movement: E-government!! Are you serious?!
To answer these questions briefly: no, civic technology is not e-government; and yes, Im serious. E-government still matters quite a lot to the group of people most likely to disseminate detailed information about technology and governancethe academic research community.
Civic technology and e-government are not the same thing for two reasons: First, they have different core users. Second, they operate under different theories of governance.
E-government aims to replicate existing government in electronic form. It has a clear core user group. By its very identity, government must be the implementer of e-government technologyits functions cant be provided by a non-governmental source. E-government aims at providing the public with an electronic facsimile of government. What regular government achieves with person-to-person interactions, e-government aims to do online. Whether those interactions are providing specific information or completing a required transaction like renewing a drivers license, e-government can offer a digital version of these functions that the internet-capable public can access conveniently and efficiently.
There is nothing wrong with this vision of improving government. Its a tremendously valuable thing when services are provided online as well as they are offline. E-government does not strive to go beyond this, however. It just adds technology to a traditional expectation of how government works: that governments deliver the services which officials, elected by the public, direct it to provide. If this is how government traditionally works:
Icons used in these diagrams were created by Chacha Sikes, Krisada, and Dmitry Beranovskiy from Noun Project.
This is how it works with e-government:

E-government uses technology to improve the existing flow of government service execution. However disruptive technology might be, e-government does not alter the traditional model of governance.
Civic technology, on the other hand, is different both in its user groups and in its model of governance. It is technology which supports the flow of information and communication between government and members of the public. In terms of users, civic tech is technology which supports the government-public relationship by understanding both audiences to be core partners. In terms of models of governance, the way that civic tech increases interactions between governments and members of the public means that the traditional model of government no longer fits so well.
Although civic technology involves government as one segment of its users, it has an equally central relationship with the non-governmental public. This is different from a service which solely improves information and communication flow within government (which we call government tech), and is unlike even e-governments unidirectional provision of information and digital services to the public. Reflecting that paired relationship, civic tech does not need to be housed in government. It can be created externally, housed externally, and still authentically serve the common goals of the participating public and government.
The difference in user groups and audiences for the two technology sectors reflects an underlying difference in approaches to governance. Government tech and e-government both represent ways to use technology to help governments do what they have already been directed to do more efficiently and effectively. E-government thereby supports the traditional governance model, with traditional models for accountability: government is accountable primarily to the elected officials that direct it, trusting that the choice of elected official means that governments will ultimately, if indirectly, be responsible to the public.
Civic technology has a different aim: to transform government into an entity which simultaneously responds to both elected leaders and the public. Civic technology supports the cooperative development of government service through increasing government-public communication and information flow. Unlike the traditional governance models uni-directional relationships, civic technology provides a communication structure that can fuel a different model of governance: a Government 2.0 or open government model. Every part of the system can interact with every other part.

Because of the increased opportunities for input and feedback, this governance model has some substantial functional differences from the traditional model. By increasing public input into government, civic technology gives government an independentand perhaps competingset of directives. This feature means that the model works differently.
Needless to say, there are plenty of people who dont want technology to change the way government works. People may want technology that can just help government do its job more efficiently. In this conception of government, government often does not require public input, and its core job is to become effective at performing the tasks that its leaders set out for it. This is running government like a businessa not-uncommon aspirationand technology can help with the achievement of this goal as well.
In the differences between these two perspectives, we can see the disconnect in operating models. We can see why its so unproblematic for some people working on technology and governance to conceive of the public as customers, and we can also see while this label is as charming to others as nails on a chalkboard. It has to do with whether you are thinking of the digital tool as serving the needs a government has to present and improve its information, or as the doorway to an entirely new model of governance.
E-government and civic technology, with their different perspectives on sources of authoritative direction, will end up with different answers to the question of how technology helps us achieve the public good. Collecting and responding to public input through civic technology could actually make government less efficient. Its not uncommon in participatory processes that we find that being less efficient is the right way to achieve an outcome.
However, to the extent that we evaluate the efficacy of civic tech as a government service alone, we fail to understand it for its essential role: to transform the nature of the governance relationship into one where individuals make government directly responsive to them. This is a significant change. People are used to having government be indirectly responsive to them, through the way that most of us are used to self-government through elected representation. In the indirect responsiveness of the representative system, we accept that we trade off some of the things that we want to get others. We compromise at the ballot box once a year. With civic technologyand the possibility of weighing in on individual issues more regularly and with greater precisionwe dont have to wait for elections, or even for hearings. We can continue our pursuit of responsive governance all year around, and at our own convenience.
This, admittedly, is a maximalist vision of the effects of civic technology. Its just a dream for now. But it is a vision which foregrounds a new relationship between public and government, and one that disrupts the traditional notion that we delegate all our power to the people we elect to direct government on our behalf.
It is also a vision not yet shared by the bulk of the academic literature on government and technology. However, now that we know that, we can think more critically about how these perspectives relate to one another. We can make sure researchers working on e-government and civic technology connect regularly with one another.
And in the civic tech world, we can certainly derive value from the wisdom of our e-government colleagues whove been working to understand what happens when government service meets the internet. To the extent that civic tech implementation requires at least an open mindand better, an enthusiastic partnershipon the side of our government partners, it is best if we know where theyve been coming from.
Its the sort of thing that might have been covered in some of those 169,000 articles about e-government. Id better get back to the reading, I guess.

Organizing science: Can a ten-minute conversation with a canvasser at someones door change their mind about a strongly held opinion? A new study by David Broockman and Josh Kalla, published in Science, titled, Durably reducing transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing, says the answer is yes. As Brian Resnick explains in Vox, this is a big deal.


The money chase: Dont miss Hal Harveys mea culpa, Why I Regret Pushing Strategic Philanthropy, published in The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Heres how he starts out:
...A major challenge for strategic philanthropy is that it can create delusions of omniscience in many program officers. Instead of reviewing grant proposals, querying experts, synthesizing ideas, and respecting those with years in the field, many program directors and officers become auteurs: They begin to see themselves as the origin of intelligence as well as the arbiters of money. The grant-making business already starts with a deep imbalance of power, with one party wielding the decision-making authority and the other more or less on bended knee. Add the presumption of strategy, and in no time, grant seekers become whipsawed approval-seekers and grant makers become demigodswith all the theocratic arbitrariness that term implies.
 


And in case you think this is original or helpful, check out Ruth McCambridges riposte. As editor-in-chief of the Nonprofit Quarterly shes been criticizing the hubris of so-called strategic philanthropists for a long time.

Its time to be honest about civic tech projects that can pay their own way, and those that cant.
Some civic tech projects are crafted with sustainable income streams lovingly engineered into their DNA. I used to go slightly green with envy when I thought of the sheer elegance of the Change.org business modelcharging NGOs to send email to petitioners who are known (thanks to signing a petition) to be highly likely to support those NGOs causes. It was obviously a great service, and a great business, and the whole thing grew like a balloon. And their CEO was charismatic and good looking, too. It just wasnt Fair.
So civic tech businesses with strong revenue models definitely exist, which is awesome. Im also a big fan of Nationbuilder for this reason. And these successes have led to a certain degree of hope that with some encouragement the civic tech sector might attract a lot more tech-focused capital. The dream is that if it can become recognized as a legitimate field for tech investment, that might will then lead to a load of big, cool civic tech companies with products that people love, and with founders who get discretely rich and make everyone feel like This is definitely a Scene.
Ive met a few people over the last couple of years who have quietly made it their personal mission to get a lot more capital into the field, so we can see a lot more good companies emerge, drive a lot more innovation in the civic tech space, and deliver the quality of services to citizens that we all know can be achieved if only the money can be found to pay for it.
I hope these advocates succeedI really do. Id love to see a new generation of robust, digital-era companies take on and beat the incumbents who gave us Healthcare.gov and other public disgraces. That simply cannot happen without a lot of cash, and some serious returns to draw in the money. I cross all my fingers and toes that the quiet advocates Ive met succeed.
Butand of course theres a butI think that the widely shared desire to create a strong market of healthy, profitable civic tech companies has to some extent obscured an awkward and inconvenient truth, one that needs dragging out into the light. This truth is that there are, quite simply, some terrific civic tech ideas out there that will always run at a loss.
Some ideas will run at a loss because they cannot come up with viable commercial models. And others will run at a loss because they cannot attract small donors. Others still will run at a loss because they suck and deserve to failbut this article isnt really about those.
What I want is for people to be able to say, loud and proud, I have a great civic tech idea but it simply doesnt come with a self-funding model. There are numerous reasons why our field will be stronger and healthier if this becomes a statement people are less embarrassed about making.
First, its important to de-stigmatize this statement because there is every reason to expect that valuable civic services will emerge that neither have commercial revenue models, nor are attractive for people to pay for on an individual basis. Peoples relationship with the civic realm comes with a strange and historically conditioned set of expectations about money and payment that make it different from markets and other nonprofit sectors where payment or small dollar charitable funding are totally normal. People will happily pay for petrol to drive to the voting booth but they certainly will not happily pay to vote. Everyone knows that the police and fire department cost a great deal of money to run, but nobody expects them to turn up with a credit card machine, once summoned. None of these services are condemned as bad ideas unworthy of funding because people bafflingly refuse to pay at the point of service. There is every reason to think that civic tech projects will emerge that are both highly valued by citizens and yet strangely immune to normal payment strategies. I would argue that these already exist in some places.
Second, it is important that the new wave of general tech investors who are expected to bring capital to the civic tech market understand that civic tech isnt quite as simple as another tech market, like the sharing economy or VR. Civic tech contains a market of potentially strong companies, but it contains a load of other non-market stuff too. If were not really open and honest about this mixed ecosystem and the presence of great organizations that arent great businesses, I suspect that some potential investors will be suspicious that they arent being given the full picture.
Its also important to be able to talk honestly about not achieving self-funding because it will stop impactful-but-not-profitable ideas being distorted into impactless-but-possibly-profitable ideas. The rise of social enterprise and impact investing as energized, growing fields hasalmost entirely unintentionallyled to a generalized feeling that if you have a socially impactful idea without a cool business model that youre a failure, that your idea sucks, that you suck and dont get it. Theres never been a more difficult time to say Yes, our project is going to have to find external money forever, even if that is completely true, regardless of whether the project is brilliantly useful and socially important. That stigma makes a lot of people make a lot of bad decisions, and tell a lot of half-truths.
Lastly, its important that we can talk openly about civic tech projects that cant foot their own bills because governments and funders must not be allowed to live with the illusion that theres something magical about civic tech, some voodoo that will allow us to have amazing public goods for zero ongoing public or philanthropic costs. Yes, there will be amazing companies that will create massive public value at low cost (this is why the civic tech market is exciting) but there will always be plentiful gaps that can only be filled by services that cant generate their own revenues. You only have to look into the center of any modern city to see what this mix looks likepublic goods sit alongside private goods in basically all healthy urban environments.
By way of conclusion, let me explain why Ive not named any civic tech organizations in this piece except for ones that are self-sustaining businesses. My reason for this omission is that right now the people running those organizations would quite likely consider it harmful to their chances of surviving and raising money, to be labelled as such. Some would probably get quite angry at me for damaging their chances of securing future funding.
This is very essence of the problemcivic tech is a field in which a substantial number of all players feel they have to twist the truth to survive, distort their own missions until they no longer make sense, and in the process disappoint funders and confuse everyone else. If we can be honest and non-judgemental about who should be trying to make their own money and who shouldnt then we can have a stronger sector with a higher success rate and a clearer story to tell about what we do.

Scotland 2016: The BBC Scotland this week kicks off a series of four special topic debates in advance of the May 5 Scottish Parliament election.
These discussions will include questions from audience members chosen for their interest in the issues: tax and spending (the topic of tonights debate), health, energy and the environment, and housing.
Holding on Line 1: The phrase President-elect Donald Trump was tested during the first leaders debate in Scotland last month. The final question to the politicians asked what they would say if they received a phone call from a victorious Trump.

Scottish National Party Leader Nicola Sturgeon, who has already called for Trump to be banned from the U.K., said shed be on the other line. Watch the video for more responses.
Call for Sign Language Interpreters: For all the technology employed during debates, it seems organizers are not making the debates fully accessible. Disability rights activists criticized the leaders debates hosted in March by STV and BBC Scotland for not providing British Sign Language interpreters.
Following similar criticism in the Philippines, interpreters were added to the second presidential debate, which took place March 20 at the University of the Philippines Cebu.

Advocates for the deaf community praised the move but are hoping the inset box is enlarged for the third and final debate scheduled for April 24.
The interpreters drew much praise on social media. As one person on Twitter wrote:

 Peru 2016: A week before Perus April 10 general election, 10 candidates took part in a televised presidential debate in Lima. Following opening statements on priority actions, the candidates were paired off to address issues and then took questions from citizens. The debate was organized by the National Elections Jury, IDEA International, and the Consortium for Economic and Social Investigation.

Analysis of a Social Media Election: Returning to the Irish general election, Laura Slattery of the Irish Times considers the role of social media. One of the debates was a RTE2 Facebook Election special that took place at Facebooks offices in Dublin.
Attended by political representatives, not party leaders, the arrangement was unusual: Politicians sat alongside members of the audience in a horseshoe-shaped row. The Irish Times Harry McGee wrote that the format lent itself to a more low-key debate, focused on the issues, without the verbal sparring that has been evident in other debates.
Slattery wrote that the set-up meant the camera could frame both spiel-delivering candidates and aghast youth in the one shotor, as happened, they could go long on a young woman explaining why the Eighth Amendment was great while simultaneously capturing a boom mic clattering into the head of [Minister for Health] Leo Varadkar. The average viewership was 97,000, or about 1/6 of what RTE attracted for its leaders debates.
U.S. News
Town Hall Format Has its Roots in Nixons 1968 Presidential Campaign: Stephen Battaglio of the L.A. Times takes a closer look at the increasing popularity of the town hall and the impact of taking questions from audience members.
A debate is like three-dimensional chess or a civil knife fight, CNNs Anderson Cooper said. You have people competing against each other with very strict but clear cut parameters on the time they have for responses. The town hall allows you to have a conversation with the candidate.
Its a rare time in the campaign when the questions come from the voters and not us, said CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist.
And those questions often yield more nuanced answers. MSNBCs Chris Matthews pushed Donald Trump last week on his stance on abortion, but the original question came from a University of Wisconsin at Green Bay student in the audience.

Columnist Jules Whitcover Jules Whitcover praised the town hall forum for being clearly more conducive to the concentrated interrogation of Mr. Trump that generated his damaging response, but added that the traditional debate has its place, too.
Together, the two forms of political combat, steered by knowledgeable and fair moderators, are conducive to the goal of an informed electorate, which should be the prime objective, beyond ever-higher viewership and television revenues, wrote Whitcover. 
In an interview with TVNewser, Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren said: I think candidates answer questions differently for the media than for the people. They answer questions more deeply, and you have bigger answers. And theyre not looking for insults from each other. Theyre actually answering the questions.
As Battaglio points out, Fox News Channels Roger Ailes and CNNs Jeff Zucker are no strangers to the town hall format: Ailes created the Man in the Arena shows in which Nixon took questions from a representative sampling of citizens during his presidential campaign in 1968, and Zucker scheduled Ross Perot to take questions from viewers who called into the Today show in 1992.
There have been 25 town halls so far this primary season, and while their ratings arent as high as the debates, they still manage to attract two to three times the average primetime cable news network audience, notes Itay Hod at The Wrap, in a eye-opening look at the amount of money networks and cable news channels are making off this years election.
Crowdsourcing Science Questions: The nonprofit ScienceDebate.org is calling for one presidential debate to focus on science, health, tech, and environmental issues, and is crowdsourcing the best science-related questions with an online submission form.
Questions posed by ScienceDebate.org have helped shape the past two presidential elections; in 2008 and 2012, the presidential nominees of both parties provided written responses to the groups top 14 science questions, Denise Robbins writes at Media Matters.
Media Matters previously released a report showing the dearth of climate-related questions debate moderators have asked about climate change.
Putting Voters First in Indiana: The 9-year-old Indiana Debate Commission, which calls itself the oldest incorporated and independent state-level debate group in the nation, has created a platform to submit questions for candidates in Indianas Republican primary debate for U.S. Senate.
A televised debate between candidates Marlin Stutzman and Todd Young is scheduled for April 18. Those who submit selected questions may be asked to attend the debate and pose the question during the live broadcast.
We have taken questions from the public ever since our organizations first round of debates in 2008, and we are continuing that custom in this debate, said IDC President Dan Byron, a founding board member. We strongly believe in our motto of Putting Voters First. We want to know what voters consider to be important issues that candidates should address.

Election 2016Rethinking DebatesSocial MediaWorld 





This is civic tech: Say hello to Data USA, a free and open source hub for the visualization of U.S. public data, built and launched yesterday by the MIT Media Lab and Deloitte.


Heres U.S. Digital Service co-founder Haley Van Dycks TED Talk about how she and her colleagues are transforming how the government delivers critical services and saving millions of dollars. (If you attended the 2015 edition of our Personal Democracy Forum, you got to see an equally good version of this talk nine months early at one-twentieth the ticket price. Im just saying.)


Related (sadly): It looks like the TSA Randomizer app, which causes an iPad to randomly produce a right arrow or a left arrow to direct people in line at airport security, cost the government close to $50,000, which it paid to IBM, according to this FOIA request from Kevin Burke. [Updated. The $1.4 million number previously cited was a larger contract with IBM which included the randomizer app.]


Congrats to Alexander Howard, longtime Personal Democracy Media friend and sometime contributing writer, who is joining the Sunlight Foundation as a senior analyst.


Tech and politics: Not one of the 2016 presidential candidates stands out when it comes to ensuring that common sense technology and entrepreneurship policy will prevail, Bradley Tusk (Mike Bloombergs 2009 campaign manager) writes in TechCrunch.


Trump watch: An investigation by Politico reporters Kenneth Vogel and Brianna Gurciullo finds that Donald Trump has assembled a privately funded security and intelligence force with a far wider reach than other campaigns private security operations: tracking and rooting out protesters, patrolling campaign events and supplementing [his] Secret Service protection.


Age of transparency: Pressure is building on Icelands Prime Minister to quit, in the wake of stories from the Panama Papers detailing how he and his wife have circumvented laws requiring the disclosure of assets held overseas, as Steven Erlanger reports for the New York Times.


So far, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is managing the leaked documents, has only been able to identify 211 people with American addresses in the data, but that is only from recent years, not the full 11.5 million files from the leak, Fusions investigative unit, one the of the participants in the reporting, explains. Its worth noting that corporate secrecy in Nevada is even less transparent than the British Virgin Islands, and as longtime Congressional anti-corruption investigator Jack Blum points out, the Panamanian law firm at the center of the leak, Mossack Fonseca had a subsidiary to create American offshore corporations in Nevada.


Brave new world: On May 15th, my house will stop working. My landscape lighting will stop turning on and off, my security lights will stop reacting to motion, and my home made vacation burglar deterrent will stop working. This is a conscious intentional decision by Google/Nest. Thats Arlo Gilbert, writing on Medium about the pending shutdown of his Revolv home automation device. Nest bought Revolv in 2014. Imagine if you bought a Dell computer and Dell then informed you that when your warranty ends your computer will power down. Imagine if Apple put out a new policy that not only wont they replace the device for defects, but they will actually be bricking your phone 12 months after purchase.

Age of transparency: A massive leak of 11.5 million documents spanning 1977-2015 from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca is revealing how hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, including many politicians and their family members, have used anonymous shell corporations to hide their money and nefarious dealings. Among those named: the current leaders of Argentina, Iceland, Saudi Arabia, the Ukraine, the father of the British Prime Minister, and several close associates of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. More than 100 media outlets are working on digging through the trove.


Russian dissident blogger Alexei Navalny tweets, Based on these documents the entire top of the Russian authorities should be in prison.


Calls for a snap election in Iceland in response to the revelations could lead to the election of the Pirate Party, which has been leading in the polls there for months. (Heres Pirate Party co-founder Birgitta Jonsdottir being interviewed  by yours truly last June at Personal Democracy Forum.) More than two percent of the countrys population are signed up for a protest outside the Icelandic Parliament tomorrow.


Here are all the documents that have been released so far, on Document Cloud.


Tech and politics: Buried inside this pre-mortem on the Bernie Sanders campaign, written by Patrick Healy and Yamiche Alcindor for the New York Times, is this damning statement by former Senator Bob Kerrey, arguing that Sanders mishandled the issue of Hillary Clintons emails. The email story is not about emails, Kerrey said. It is about wanting to avoid the reach of citizens using FOIA to find out what their government is doing, and then not telling the truth about why she did. (Kerrey has endorsed Clinton, by the way.)


The White House has finally gotten a technology upgrade, thanks in part to the efforts of David Recordon, formerly of Facebook, Michael Shear reports for the New York Times. He notes, not quite noticing the irony or the revolving door, The Wi-Fi in the Roosevelt Room is finally strong enough to live-stream an event on Facebook.


Trump watch: Here are some new facts about Donald Trumps campaign that you can learn from reading Gabriel Shermans detailed account in New York magazine: Trumps social media director, Dan Scavino, first earned Trumps trust as his golf caddie and has no prior political experience; the campaign has no pollsters, media coaches, speechwriters or focus groups; Trump apparently has dirt on Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, that he hasnt used; he hired his campaign manager-cum-bouncer Corey Lewandowski on the recommendation of David Bossie of Citizens United; his daughter Ivanka Trump is responsible for his semi-supportive statements about Planned Parenthood; and his email list, built from people who have registered to attend his rallies, is estimated by Lewandowski to be in the millions at this point.


Crypto-wars, continued: The FBI is telling local law enforcement agencies it will help them unlock iPhones, BuzzFeeds Salvador Hernandez reports.


What sharing economy? Airbnb says it is purging its San Francisco site of hosts with multiple listings, Carolyn Said reports for SFGate.com, following a similar move in New York City.


Brave new world: The jury verdict against Gawker in the Hulk Hogan case is a sign that the culture is finally turning against the internets relentless destruction of personal privacy, Jim Rutenberg writes for the New York Times.


Will Oremus explains why Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and the rest of the crop of digital assistants are creepily humanizing.

Narrowing the digital divide: The FCC voted yesterday to expand the Lifeline subsidy program for low-income Americans to include broadband service, Jim Puzzanghera reports for the Los Angeles Times. Nearly half of households earning less than $25,000 a year currently lack high-speed internet.


The advocacy organization Free Press issued a press release commending the decision, but added, Much work remains: The FCC needs to devote additional resources to promoting affordable broadband options across the board. Consolidation and the lack of effective competition have left people of all income levels in the United States paying way too much for Internet access. Its a shortcoming that has direct and negative impacts on everyone seeking these essential services. Lifeline is but one tool the FCC can use to address costs. If the agencys primary goal is to get as many people as possible using broadband, it must do more to make all broadband services affordable.


Researchers Chris Benner and Kyle Neering at the University of California Santa Cruz have written a white paper on the subcontracted workers in Silicon Valley, which they describe as the invisible workforce of the tech industry. They found that the number of subcontracting has increased three times as quickly as that of overall Silicon Valley employment in the past 24 years. Of the blue-collar contract workers, 58 percent are black or Latino (compared to only 10 percent of direct tech employees) and the average annual pay for those blue-collar contract industry workers is a mere $19,900 (compared to the average of $113,000 for direct tech employees).


The San Jose City Council approved a mayoral plan to use more technology to cope with several years of budget cuts and a reduction in capacity, Alyssa Doom writes for the Sunlight Foundation blog. The initiative includes expanding the use of data analytics to improve public safety; making online services easier to access and use; providing internet access to a broader range of users; developing partnerships with private-sector actors, the academic community and other organizations to enhance opportunities for collaboration; andnear and dear to Sunlights heartutilizing open data to improve the publics access to information.

The future of alternate side parking?: A tiny tech startup in St. Paul, Minnesota, wants to use smart lighting grids to help cities communicate with residents and visitors, Julio Ojeda-Zapata reports for the Twin Cities Pioneer Press. One simple use-case scenario is letting people know where they can and cannot park during a snowstorm, but the creator also tells Ojeda-Zapata that they could be used as a warning system.


This data firm is working with the World Bank to collect price information in Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria, with plans to expand elsewhere, Hayley Tsukayama reports for the Washington Post. Locals in target areas can share photos of price tags for goods sold in the area, taken with a smart phone, with the data firm, Premise, in exchange for payment, and then Premise aggregates the information to share with clients.


A warrant canary is conspicuously missing from Reddits 2015 transparency report, which was published yesterday, Cyrus Farivar writes for Ars Technica. CEO Steve Huffman commented on a thread about the report, Ive been advised not to say anything one way or the other.


Martin Moore, the director of the Center for the Study of Media Communications and Power in the Policy Institute at Kings College London, has written a hefty paper on the civic power of tech giants, arguing that these powers should be acknowledged and taken into account when crafting policies or regulation.

Different broken windows: After immersing herself in the Trump Twittersphere, and even attending a Trump rally, Zeynep Tufekci has this dispatch from the heart of Trumpland, on alternate realities and the fall of the gatekeepers. The Overton window, the range of politically acceptable policies and beliefs that can be publicly discussed, has been broken by Trump and his supporters, Tufekci writes, and there is no going back.

Study says: In spite of the enduring mythos of Silicon Valley as meritocratic utopia, with Harvard dropouts Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg leading by example, labor market data shows that job postings for developers in the Silicon Valley tech sector are even more likely to demand a college degree at minimum than the tech sector at large, and much more likely than job postings for developers in other sectors, Lauren Weber reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Civic tech takes on Congress: Were coming to this a bit late, but in this excellent blog post the founder of TechCongress, Travis Moore, shares lessons learned during recruitment of the inaugural class of Congressional Innovation Fellows. Under the assumption that the application would naturally find its way to primarily liberal, white, male technologists, outreach efforts were focused on attracting underrepresented groups: women, minority, LGBT, veteran, and conservative candidates. Consequently, 43 percent of the applicants were from these under-represented groups.
Moore concludes, Congress has a 14 percent approval rating. This election cycle is the most angry and bitter of this, or perhaps several, generations. And many of the Legislative Branchs problems may be intractable for years to come. But with 24 days notice, 213 technologists applied to be an inaugural Congressional Innovation Fellow.

Crypto-wars, continued: Remember when it was absolutely critical for national security that Apple help the FBI break into an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters? Now, not so much. As Danny Yadron reports for the Guardian, the government has dropped its court fight after managing to get into the phone without Apples help. Which makes Apples claims about the security of its products a little shaky.


When people are made aware that they are under surveillance, they are less likely to speak out about nonconformist ideas, a new academic study by Wayne State University professor Elizabeth Stoycheff finds, reports Karen Turner for the Washington Post.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump talked foreign policy with Maggie Haberman and David Sanger of The New York Times, and here is what he had to say about Americas capabilities in cyber-warfare, verbatim:
First off, were so obsolete in cyber. Were the ones that sort of were very much involved with the creation, but were so obsolete, we just seem to be toyed with by so many different countries, already. And we dont know whos doing what. We dont know whos got the power, whos got that capability, some people say its China, some people say its Russia. But certainly cyber has to be a, you know, certainly cyber has to be in our thought process, very strongly in our thought process. Inconceivable that, inconceivable the power of cyber. But as you say, you can take out, you can take out, you can make countries nonfunctioning with a strong use of cyber. I dont think were there. I dont think were as advanced as other countries are, and I think you probably would agree with that. I dont think were advanced, I think were going backwards in so many different ways. I think were going backwards with our military. I certainly dont think we are, we move forward with cyber, but other countries are moving forward at a much more rapid pace. We are frankly not being led very well in terms of the protection of this country.
 


Questions about the security of Hillary Clintons private email server appear to be at the heart of the FBIs ongoing investigation, reports Robert OHarrow Jr. for the Washington Post. When Clinton became Secretary of State, she insisted on continuing to use her private Blackberry, even as State Department security officials struggled to find a way to secure it, he reports. But they were never told about her private server and took no steps to protect it against intrusion. In addition to determining what classified material flowed through it, the FBI is also trying to determine if it was hacked. A total of 147 agents have been deployed to run down leads, OHarrow reports.

New in the Rethinking Debates series: Smile, Youre On Nico Nico Douga! Japan was late to using the internet to engage voters during elections, but the countrys first livestreamed debate involved the public in an unprecedented way.
This Week in Debates
Scotland: The leaders of Scotlands six largest political parties meet today in the first of two debates hosted by BBC Scotland. The debate will take place in front of an audience of voters at BBC Scotlands Pacific Quay headquarters. The election is scheduled for May 5. 
Guidelines require the BBC to have a balanced audience. An application with questions about voting history and political party membership is available online.
 The Philippines: Organizers of the March 20 presidential debate in the Philippines promised fewer commercials and tougher questions than the first debate, and it appears they somewhat succeeded.
  
The three-hour debate at University of the Philippines-Cebu started 90 minutes late, however, due to disagreement over whether the candidates could bring notes on stage. Many on social media, wanting to know the reason for the delay, tweeted #PiliPinasDeLate and #PiliPinasDeLate2016, a riff on the popular #PiliPinasDebates2016.
#PilipinasDebates2016 trends both in PH & worldwide; netizens create #PilipinasDeLate https://t.co/MExgcpIzhQ https://t.co/eB8BnCjDov
 CNN Philippines (@cnnphilippines) March 20, 2016

One of the candidates, Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, couldnt attend in person due to health reasons. As questions were posed to the other four candidates, her campaign staff posted tweets about Santiagos position on the issues, reported the Inquirer.net. Her views on divorce (she is the only candidate who supports it, under very restrictive conditions), received the most reaction: 3,617 likes and 3,163 retweets.
The debates, the first in the Philippines since 1992, have become huge media events. The next and final presidential debate is April 20, and the election is May 9. 
Zoran Milanovic
Croatia: Zoran Milanovic, former prime minister of Croatia and president of the Social Democratic Party, is hoping for a televised debate with SDP Vice President Zlatko Komadina, who is challenging Milanovic for the leadership position.
The SDP has received hosting offers from six TV stations and one newspaper. Komadina wants to debate in front of party members.
Elections in the largest opposition party are an issue of the utmost interest to the public, and TV debates between the candidates are the highest expression of democratic political culture, Milanovic wrote on Facebook. We are a strong party that really should be an example of openness, transparency and clarity in expressing views and exchanging opinions.
 Canada: A televised debate between Saskatchewan Party Leader Brad Wall and New Democratic Party Leader Cam Broten Wednesday night in advance of the Saskatchewan general election on April 4 produced a Donald Trump moment, reports CBC News.
You havent said how youre going to pay for these [promises], Wall said. This is the Donald Trump section of your platform. Whos going to pay for this? Mexico?
 
Ive never been compared to Donald Trump. Thats a first, said Broten.
Other U.S. comparisons were drawn in advance of the debate, with a call for more party inclusion. Though there have been no third-party candidates in U.S. primary debates this election cycle, political columnist Murray Mandryk notes that more than a dozen presidential hopefuls got to take part, while the Saskatchewan leaders debate involved only two. 
About Those U.S. Debates ...
Engaging More Voters, Not More Candidates: During a forum at George Washington University on Tuesday (which GW livestreamed on Facebook), Mike McCurry, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said the Commission is tested every four years on including third-party candidates and has concluded that the candidates on stage in the fall should be those the public is expecting to see and is seriously considering.
The threshold for participation is reaching 15 percent in leading polls. If third parties cant get 15 percent, they may need to find better candidates, said McCurry. 
He also noted that the Commission is committed to curating questions from the public via social media for the town hall debate format. Referencing the work of the Commission in off-election years assisting other countries in developing their own political debates, McCurry said people in other democracies are astounded average citizens get to stand up and question who gets to lead the country. 
Figuring out how to preserve that aspect of the debates, while making it an authentic representation of what people think, is on the Commissions agenda.
The forum, which included McCurrys co-chair, Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., and ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz (a veteran of two primary debates and one VP debate), featured lots of discussion about debate formats, questions and this years candidates.

Cross-Over Viewing: Nielsen has launched an Election Central full of political and media data, including volume of tweets during debates and presidential candidates book sales.
A report by Nielsen on the first six debates for both Democrats and Republicans concluded the debates reached 97 million Americans, with about equal numbers watching the Democratic debates (68 million) as those that watched the Republican debates (67 million).
The analysis also found that about 30.2 million viewers watched only the Democratic debates while roughly 29.2 million viewers only viewed the Republican debates. Additionally, 37.8 million viewers watched both debates. 
 Host With the Most: The majority of those debates have been watched on CNN. We are the cable network that doesnt choose sides, Sam Feist, CNNs Washington bureau chief, tells the Washington Post. That perspective and a big financial investment in Election 2016 have helped CNN dominate the primaries.
 Hot Fact: Of the 1,477 questions asked during the past 20 presidential primary debates, 22 questions (1.5 percent), have been about climate change, according to Media Matters Primary Debate Scorecard. Republican frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have not fielded any questions on the subject.

The city piloted digital ballots for the first time last year. (Asher Novek)

Starting this Saturday, New Yorkers in more than half of New York Citys 51 council districts will help decide how to spend at least one million dollars from the public budget in each districtmore than $30 million in total. From dog runs to new computers for public schools to sidewalk extensions that make the streets safer for pedestrians, Participatory Budgeting (PB) lets New Yorkers vote for the projects they want to see in their community. This year, for the first time, the city is offering digital voting options in all 28 participating districts, and in 11 districts, residents will have the option to pre-register in-person and vote online at a later time.
Democracy 2.1, the organization working with the city on PB, has also addressed concerns about efficiency and security by redesigning the ballot to make it more scanner-friendly, acquiring better scanning software, and creating a registration application so council members staffers are verifying voters in the same way in every district. (Democracy 2.1, or D21, is an organizational member of Civic Hall.)
This is the citys fifth year of doing participatory budgeting, although cities in Brazil have been doing PB since 1989. When it began in New York City, only four council members participated. This year, 28 council districts are running PB, four more than last year. Increased interest has raised more questions about fair representation, which D21 has sought to address in the year and a half since they first partnered with the city.
Charts showing the growth of PB in New York City, compiled by the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center with the PBNYC Research Team as part of their 2015 report.
Last year, they tried digital ballots for the first time, and experimented with alternative voting interfaces as part of a research project with Stanford. This year, D21 expanded the digital ballot initiative and worked to make the process both more inclusive and more efficient. For the first time, districts polled residents online as well as offusing one of D21s special polling algorithms for the online voteabout their project preferences before the projects were even sent to the city for technical review. Having an online vote meant that people could participate in the deliberation stage even if work or other obligations kept them from attending meetings in person.
By the time you get to the final vote youve already reduced the number of projects that only appeal to a small number of people, D21s Lex Paulson explained to Civicist. The point is not to exclude the three people who care about dog runs but to open the door even further.
According to Paulson, making the first stage of the process more inclusive means that fewer people will show up to vote next week and wonder how and why certain projects got on the ballot, and why their interests werent represented.
The pre-registration process this year, which will run in only 11 districts, should make the process more inclusive as well. It will allow district staffers to recruit participants earlier and longer; some districts started pre-registering last week. Once the voter has been entered into the registration app, they receive a unique pin code and ballot url via text or email. When voting begins, theyll get another reminder to cast their ballot.
The expansion of participatory budgeting was one of the citys accomplishments trumpeted by New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito in her State of the City address in February, and was used as a rallying cry for additional innovations in regular elections as well:
PB is a laboratory for what an enfranchised voting populace is all about...in the City Councils last PB cycle, we tested diverse strategies to bring democracy to voters  including reminder texts that say when, where, and how to cast a PB vote. The result was unprecedented participation across all sectors of our City  especially among our youth. In fact, 12 percent of the total PB ballots were cast by New Yorkers under the age of 18!

(Depending on the district, residents as young as 14 or 16 can participate in PB.)
Building on her praise of text reminders, Mark-Viverito promised to bring similar reminders via text and email to regular New York elections as well, although as I reported for Civicist, making that a reality is not as easy as it might seem.
Hollie Russon Gilman, Civicist contributer and the author of Democracy Reinvented: Participatory Budgeting and Civic Innovation in America, said of New Yorks PB effort: Within the U.S., this is cutting edge, especially in terms of scale.
Other cities have explored SMS voting and digital pilots but not at this breadth or depth, she added. Globally there have been several PB [cycles] conducted solely online...in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, online participation was three to five times higher than participation rates in face-to-face rounds of PB occurring in the same year.

Tech and politics: Uh-oh. As the Republican national convention approaches and the likelihood of a chaotic floor fight increases, the rival presidential campaigns are starting to focus on finding a killer app to help them track delegates in real-time, Darren Samuelsohn reports for Politico. Given that bandwidth inside the convention arena will likely be overloaded, and real-time tools sometimes fail when stressed (does anyone remember Mitt Romneys Project ORCA?), the old-fashioned methods of tracking (spreadsheets, runners, walkie-talkies) may work best. Though I have to admit, when I first read this storys headlineGOP campaigns hunt for convention killer appI thought it was going to be about whether people will be allowed to bring guns inside, given that Ohio is an open carry state.

After you get past the personal nastiness that is Evgeny Morozovs trademark as a writer and cultural critic, take a look at his substantive critique in The Baffler magazine of former State Department innovation adviser Alec Ross new book, The Industries of the Future. Ross (full disclosure: a longtime friend of Personal Democracy Media) was a leading voice for the Internet Freedom agenda that was an hallmark of Hillary Clintons early tenure at the State Department, but later got dropped after WikiLeaks illustrated the actual limits of the Obama Administrations support for people-powered open government. Morozovs trenchant (and sometimes over-the-top) criticisms of Silicon Valleys hucksterism are already well-known, but in this review he makes a sharp and useful point that youll also find in Douglas Rushkoffs new book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: for all the talk about disruption, our newly minted tech moguls arent disrupting the most powerful institution of all: Big Finance. Heres how Morozov puts it:
Despite incessant proclamations to the contrary, the purse still wields more power than the cellphone. And given the growing indebtedness of the population and the financializaton of everything under the sun, citizens stand to be further disempowered for the benefit of elites, banks, and transnational institutions. (The latter barely get a mention in Rosss book.) Populism is on the rise across the globe not because citizens feel empowered by new technologies, but because they feel disempowered by everything else. These populist movements might even be putting technologies to good use. But as the Greek experience shows us, while a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin might offer some hypothetical lifeline to a government that subscribes to an alternative political and economic agenda, other mechanisms of powermostly the old-fashioned banking systempreclude its actual deployment.
The Civic Hall book club will be discussing Rushkoffs book, with the author on hand(!), on April 5.


Are you an activist or an organizer? Either way, make the time to read Astra Taylors terrific essay Against Activism, which is also in The Baffler.


What sharing economy? Sharing economy critic Tom Slee describes in Jacobin how well-funded pre-IPO startups like Uber and Airbnb have selectively released data to try to tilt public perceptions in their favor, while investigative reporters are steadily uncovering more disquieting questions about their business practices.

Tech and politics: Bundlers rejoice! Former Obama fundraiser Steve Spinners company RevUp Software is rolling out an algorithm that optimizes high-dollar fundraising by making it easier for people to mine their relationships and discover new potential donors, as Joshua Green reports for Bloomberg. Investors in the company include Pierre Omidyar, Reid Hoffman, and Sean Parker. Green writes:
After a year of beta testing, RevUp recently launched its data analytics software, into which anyonecandidate, staff, volunteer fundraisercan upload a list of personal contacts from Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, or other sources, along with the candidate or cause for which he is raising money. The software then spiders through records aggregated from thousands of public and private websites and databases, checking the names against everything from dozens of public-election databases (such as the Federal Election Commissions), to political groups (the Federalist Society, the Sierra Club), to thousands of charities and nonprofits (Boys & Girls Clubs, the Ms. Foundation for Women), even to colleges and universities. The information this journey yields is rich enough to determine a persons political leanings and even their past support for specific candidates, thus eliminating the possibility of awkward, friendship-wrecking phone calls. What spits out the other end is ones contacts ranked by their ability and likelihood to give, whether or not theyve donated to a campaign before.


Oddly, Spinner thinks that his tool, which sounds like it will indeed make it easier for politicians and bundlers to figure out which people to tap for donations, will reduce the time they spend raising money and allow them to be more civic-minded. Thats like thinking that if you widen a highway, there will be less traffic on it. With RevUp, the arms race for money will just get worse. And politicians will be just as money-minded as before.


Longtime digital strategist Peter Dauo, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, says he is planning legal action against people who have been defaming him online.


Trump watch: Asked by Bloomberg Politics about using nuclear weapons against ISIS, Donald Trump says, Im never going to rule anything outI wouldnt want to say. Even if I wasnt, I wouldnt want to tell you that because at a minimum, I want them to think maybe we would use them.... We need unpredictability. We dont know who these people are.


Last night the mudslinging between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz reached another low point, with Trump threatening to spill the beans on Cruzs wife Heidi in response to an anti-Trump online ad (made by Make America Awesome again, a PAC run by Liz Mair) that includes a nude photo of Trumps wife Melania that was originally shot for Britsh GQ in 2000, as Brendan OConnor recounts for Gawker. (The ad is being micro targeted at Mormon women on Instagram, in case you were wondering.)

Image captured from Nov. 29 , 2012 debate on Nico Nico Douga / Global Voices




Case Study: First livestreamed debate on Nico Nico Douga (now Niconico)
Country: Japan
Debate: Nov. 29, 2012

On Nov. 29, 2012, 10 party leaders in Japan took part in the nations first livestreamed pre-election debate. The debate featured a question-and-answer format with a single moderator and a studio audience. To those watching online, it looked at first like a regular political debateuntil viewers comments appeared on screen.
The livestream was broadcast on the popular video sharing site Nico Nico Douga, which essentially translates as Smiley Smiley Video. Nico Nico Douga users could type in comments about the candidates, and the comments appeared in an overlay on screen, creating a discussion about the debate that was open to anyone using the platform.
In essence, the viewers were participating in the debate conversation, tooand potentially creating a new form of political engagement in the process.
From Arkansas to Japan
Nico Nico Douga has its roots in the middle of Arkansas. It was at the University of Central Arkansas in 1999 that a Japanese foreign exchange student named Hiroyuki Nishimura created an internet bulletin board system that allowed anyone to post any kind of content. Nishimura did it to kill time, he told Wired Magazine in 2008.
But the idea created out of boredom turned out to fill a very big void in Japanthe desire for a free, anonymous space in which people could say whatever they wanted.
The bulletin board, 2channel, served as a precursor to Nico Nico Douga, which Nishimura developed in 2007. Whats unique about the Nico Nico Douga site, Lisa Katayama wrote in Wired, is that the Flash-based video files have an extra interactive layer that lets viewers insert text on top of any clip as easily as if they were typing an instant message, and it displays that comment whenever someone else loads the video.
The platform eventually began offering live programming, too, including news conferences and concerts. It also found success in showing edited TV programming in its entirety, including a 2009 debate between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). That type of unfiltered content attracted users, who quickly flocked to the site.
After a year of existence, Nico Nico Douga had more than 6 million registered users. By 2011, it had 20 million users. And users loved voicing their unfiltered opinions.
But while Nico Nico Douga was quickly carving out its space as an open oasis on the internet landscape, Japanese election law remained strict and limited. During the two-week election cycle, citizens could not publicly endorse a political party, and political candidates could not promote themselves on social media (Google and Twitter engaged voters with some interesting workarounds).
Still, some politicians, including LDP leader Shinzo Abe, were starting to explore the possibilities the internet offered to reach voters. Abes party even hosted a 12-hour Nico Nico Douga program from inside its headquarters early in 2012.
Breaking New Ground
The idea for a livestreamed debate initially stemmed from a challenge: After then-Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of the DPJ dissolved Parliament on Nov. 16, 2012, and set up a new election, he challenged Abe, his main opponent, to a one-on-one debate.
Abe responded with a counter-challenge: He would agree to the debate only if it was streamed on Nico Nico Douga, where it would be interactive and open to the world. After Noda reluctantly accepted Abes proposal, eight of the other party leaders also expressed interest in joining the debate.
The debate itself can be viewed on Ustream, with comments occasionally in the background, but the version with onscreen comments is not accessible on Nico Nico Douga. The Asahi Shimbun reported that during the debate, Some viewers wrote explicitly of their support for individual politicians, while others used online shorthand to express their thoughtssuch as a long string of 8s, which can be read in Japanese as the sound of applause.
Most of the applause lines were for Abe, who may have come into the debate with built-in support given his previous presence on Nico Nico Douga.
According to Nico Nico Douga, 1.4 million watched the debate on the site. But non-paying subscribers, who had to watch on a lower bandwidth, reportedly experienced viewing glitches because so many people were streaming it.
Nobuyuki Okumura, a sociology professor who watched both the free and paid-subscriber versions online, told the Asahi Shimbun, It quickly became difficult to view on the free site, adding that the site did not live up to its free-access credentials, despite this being a debate ahead of a Lower House election. There may be a need for another viewing environment, along the lines of television.

Still, despite the limitations, some acknowledged that the format itself was empowering.
More than 1 million people simultaneously shared unedited information. Thats meaningful, said viewer Hiroki Kaneda.
Saying the comments were simultaneously shared is a bit of a stretch, though. As Keiko Tanaka, writing at Global Voices, pointed out, some Twitter users were outspoken about the commenting format, which differed from Nico Nico Dougas usual practice. Instead of being posted in real-time, comments appeared on screen during a break in the on-stage discussion or a shift in topic.
As one user said, I think the debate was much more open compared to conventional television broadcasts, but it was not as open as how Nico Nico livecasts normally are.
As such, it is unclear how much, if any, of the content shown was edited before it was displayed, and if more words than usual were banned. Others on Twitter, though, would not have minded if some of it had been edited. Another user pleaded, Please. No need to show these comments. Its embarrassing just seeing them.
The comments on Nico Nico Douga did not directly correlate to the questions being asked by the moderator; though both occurred roughly in real-time, the questioning and the commentary took place on separate tracks.
Nor did it directly impact viewers in a way that the wormwhich displays real-time tracking of audience opinions during televised debateshas been shown to influence other viewers perceptions of who won the debate. [Read about New Zealands use of the worm, also part of the Rethinking Debate series.] It also appears that party leaders in the Nico Nico Douga debate did not make as many exaggerated claims as expected to attract audience attention, according to the Asahi Shimbun.
Changes in Campaigning
LDP routed the DPJ in 2012, easily securing a majority in the Lower House election, and Abe became prime minister. Three years on, Nico Nico Douga is still smiling, too. Now called just Niconico, it has continued to livestream debates, including one for the Upper House elections in the summer of 2013.
Other things have changed related to the use of technology in Japanese politics. Abe pushed through the legalization of online campaigning in 2013. His first campaign message to constituents was broadcast on none other than Niconico: I hope youll shower our candidates with lots of likes, he said in reference to Facebook.
Many remain underwhelmed with the effort; the new law still keeps the public from using e-mail to solicit support for candidates.
Even today after the law change, Japans campaign restrictions in general are far more severe than any other democratic nation, said Ellis Kraus, professor emeritus of Japanese politics and policy-making at University of California San Diego.
But the lines of openness are still being pushed to their limitsand sometimes past them, even by politicians. During the aforementioned 2013 Upper House election livestreamed debate, the leader of the LDPs Internet Media Division, Takuya Hirai, posted a comment that read, Shut it, old hag! in reference to the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Mizuho Fukushima.
Not surprisingly, Hirai received widespread criticism for his comments. When questioned about them, he remarked: Well, Im very sorry, but they were just parliamentary jeers. They werent supposed to have appeared on the screen.

In the wake of todays terror bombings in Brussels, Facebook has turned on its safety check feature again, David Meyer reports for Fortune. It was also activated in the after attacks in Nigeria and Turkey, he notes.


Heres a useful Twitter list of Brussels officials, curated by Rob Owers, the head of news, government and regional partnerships at Twitter UK.


Crypto-wars, continued: The FBI now says it may have a way to unlock the iPhone at the center of its dispute with Apple, and so it has asked the court to stay its earlier order requiring Apple to do so, David Kravets reports for ArsTechnica.


Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice explains in The Guardian why black Americans have so much at stake in the fight for digital privacy and security, and why several Black Lives Matter activists have joined in Apples fight against the FBI.


Tech and politics: Republican voters in todays Utah primary will be able to vote online, John Breeden reports for NextGov. He writes: How the process will work in Utah is that registered Republican voters can visit a portal and validate themselves using personal information like their name, address and date of birth. A unique PIN is then sent directly to their cellphone or email address, which can be used later to cast their ballot....On the backend, each vote is digitally signed and checked to make sure it corresponds to a registered voter, so no invalid votes can ever be added to the system. Each individual vote is encrypted and given a checksum value so later it can be confirmed that nothing was changed, deleted or otherwise manipulated.


Trump watch: Daniel Drezner reads through Donald Trumps interview with the Washington Post editorial board so you dont have to.


OK, you do have to read this part, where he dodges a question about using nuclear weapons against ISIS but talks for 550 words about the size of his hands.


This is civic tech: Planner and strategist Noel Franus makes a good, if obvious, point about civic innovation: its not just for technologists. He writes: Its time for a new role in our urban kaleidoscope: Executive Creative Director. The kind with money or teeth, ideally both. This is the empowered intrepreneur with free range to seek opportunities for innovation and tap into nimble, cross-disciplinary teams to jam on solutions and move quickly to prototype new futures for public services and placemaking.


US CTO Megan Smith cites the updated Cluetrain Manifesto in her conversation with Brian Fung of the Washington Post about how we need to handle online harassment. She says, Getting to the point where we together collectively care enough about solving this, where people raise the priority of solving it, is really important. One in five women will be attacked or assaulted on campus, one in 20 men. This is not acceptable. And yet its happening in the digital space, too. And its debilitating. So we have to really evolve our culture and its a heavy lift, because its not a digital-only thing; its analog meets digital.

Crypto-wars, continued: The French police have compiled a detailed report on the Paris terror attacks of last November, Rukmini Callimachi, Alissa Rubin, and Laure Fourquet report for the New York Times, but the few details it offers on how the terrorists allegedly conspired using burner phones and encryption left many security experts fuming. They write, According to the police report and interviews with officials, none of the attackers emails or other electronic communications have been found, prompting the authorities to conclude that the group used encryption. What kind of encryption remains unknown...


They also add: One of the terrorists pulled out a laptop, propping it open against the wall, said [a] 40-year-old woman [who was a hostage inside the Bataclan club while it was attacked]. When the laptop powered on, she saw a line of gibberish across the screen: It was bizarrehe was looking at a bunch of lines, like lines of code. There was no image, no internet, she said. Her description matches the look of certain encryption software, which ISIS claims to have used during the Paris attacks.


The ACLUs Christopher Soghoian tweeted, The NYT story on the Paris attackers makes as much (if not more) sense if you replace encryption with magic. And NYU journalism professor Adam Penenberg tweeted, The @nytimes proof that the Paris terrorists used encryption is law enforcement cant locate their emails and a woman saw squiggly lines.


The issue of whether encryption helped the Paris terrorists is so hot it drew The Wire creator David Simon into a friendly but heated debate on Twitter with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, as David Meyer reports for Fortune. Snowden started it by suggesting, sarcastically, that The Wire could be blamed for terrorists use of burner phones. Simon replied by arguing the case for metadata collection, and they were off.


Related: Snowden spoke Saturday in Warsaw at an event by our Personal Democracy Forum Poland co-producers the e-Panstwo Foundation. He called for an international body to arbitrate whistleblower cases.


Rainey Reitman of EFF pens an open letter on the encryption debate to President Obama: This is about math, not politics.


A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins found a security flaw in an older version of Apples iMessage platform, Ellen Nakashima reports for the Washington Post.


Tech and politics: The Bernie Sanders campaign says it has collected more than 5.7 million campaign contributions so far, compared to 2 million for Hillary Clinton, Nicole Gaudiano reports for USA Today. The Clinton campaign just touted hitting its millionth donor, a benchmark Sanders hit at the end of last year. (Clinton strategist Teddy Goff notes that it took the 2008 Obama campaign almost 13 months to hit its millionth donor while Clinton did it in about 11 months.)


Trump watch: The breakdown of the mainstream media has a lot to do with the rise of Donald Trump, argues Jim Gutenberg, the new media columnist for the New York Times. He notes how the cable networks in particular have been unable to resist the ratings that come with their wall-to-wall coverage of the short-fingered vulgarians every utterance.


With Trump addressing the pro-Israel AIPAC lobby today, the Anti-Defamation Leagues new director Jonathan Greenblatt writes, for Time magazine, that the organization is redirecting contributions it has received from Trump over the years into its anti-bias programs. He calls on other groups to follow suit. (Longtime followers of the tech-politics space may recall Greenblatts work as the founder of All for Good, an open-source platform that aimed to aggregate volunteer opportunities online.)


Anonymous has managed to dump a bunch of Trumps personal information online, including his social security number, Marie Solis reports for Mic.com. How this is supposed to help stop him is not explained.


Opponents of Trump might want to consider the arguments of longtime nonviolence advocate George Lakey, who writes more empathy for Trumps supporters, and less confrontational protests, might be the best strategy to blunt his continued rise.


Coming to this late: Network semiotician Valdis Krebs has been mapping the links between political book buyers on Amazon for each presidential cycle going back to 2004, and in this post from January he looks at the relationships among the political books of this cycle, including those by the presidential candidates. One fascinating finding: people who are buying books about Clinton and Sanders are also buying Donald Trumps Crippled America.

Trail information in Arizona is fragmented, as it is in many states. AZCentral estimates that federal, state, and tribal governments manage 81.8 percent of Arizona land, with directions, trailheads, length, and GPS coordinates spread out across those separate websites. Although trail use is on the rise, there are opportunities to better coordinate, organize, and distribute trail information.
Arizonans have abundant trail choices, but a lack of coordination among trail managers to clearly communicate those options can lead to decision paralysis. Websites like Trails.com and EveryTrail.com have tapped into the latent demand for a centralized, searchable library of trail information, and there are similar examples at the state level: HikeArizona, MaineTrailFinder, and Hike Finder in Washington. AllTrails is the most popular trail search website, hosting 50,000 trails throughout the U.S. with maps, directions, uses, reviews, photos, and an outdoor journal. AllTrails hikers share their experiences and contribute knowledge, which has fostered a sense of community on the site. Unfortunately, land managers are often left out of this equation, forgoing the chance to build relationships between land management agencies and the public.
American Trails has named Missouri Best Trail State for communicating accessible trail information to the public. In 2013, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon challenged residents to log 100MissouriMiles over the course of a year. Missourians covered 3,000,000 miles in just the first two years alone. For the challenge, the Missouri State Parks Department created an accessible space for the public to easily find information. The most noticeable feature on the homepage is a tagboard that searches and collects the publics social media posts that relate to #100MissouriMiles. This online community is just as real and important as the community on the trail.
How users can search for trails is important for driving participation as well. According to the Outdoor Foundation, the closer a trail is the more likely individuals will explore it. Several states report that residents often cant get out to the trail because of a lack of time. Allowing a user to search by proximity helps them better manage and spend their time; it could be the deciding factor for whether they go out on a hike or a bike ride, or not. Land managing agencies do not make this information readily available, so the burden of finding the closest trail is pushed off on the visitor.
The last significant feature 100MissouriMiles incorporates is a gaming component to keep participants motivated. Jane McGonial, an expert in designing games to solve problems using collaboration, explains in her TedTalk the potential of using game-like designs for motivating certain behavior. In Missouris case, various badges are offered for holidays spent on the trail, number of miles logged, and special events as a way to reward users.
In their effort to better engage the public with public lands, state agencies can look to other civic tech companies for inspiration and guidance.
SeeClickFix is one such company that has developed a platform for the public to help improve government services. In a time when government agencies are expected to be doing more with less, these types of platforms are viable options for success. Citizens participating in SeeClickFix can report non-emergency issues they see throughout their city on the web or with an app, those reports land with the appropriate government entity, and then fixers can mobilize and report progress back to the public. This type of reporting system would be especially beneficial for trail maintenance, one of biggest challenges for land managers.
Because the number of trail users outweighs the number of government staff available to continuously monitor those trails, it is much more likely that a hiker, biker, or rider will discover a washout or vandalism before the land managing agency does. When the issue is brought to the attention of the agency, the first step is to gather the necessary information about the issue and the needed resources to fix it. The second step is to communicate any changestrail closures or reroutesto the public, and if this isnt done well than frustrated users will find their planned itineraries canceled.
There are many ways that land agencies could use technology to incorporate crowdsourced information into their work. Simply using a platform like SeeClickFix as a statewide trail information hub would contribute to the efficiency of trail maintenance, but it would not capitalize on the true value the public could provide. Existing adopt-a-trail or trail steward programs should be elevated as a key component of this new, bottom-up system. Management agencies know which organizations are best positioned to take responsibility for certain sections of trials. As a trail problem is identified and shared in real time via the reporting system, the land managers designated trail steward is updated. This allows the trail stewards team to mobilize their resources and communicate their progress, eliminating the task of updating information for the land manager. With this, reporting and maintaining trails becomes the responsibility of a distributed community enabled by transparency, communication, and coordination.
Responsibility is not the only component that would become distributed with this type of platform. The much-needed environmental stewardship mission shared by land management agencies can be embedded in the design of the proposed information system. Citizens who take the time to report an issue are likely to be invested in seeing and contributing to the solution. Additionally, citizens are made aware of the club that is addressing this issue. The ability to connect to the individuals working on the ground is tangible and enticing.
Land management agencies are fortunate to be working in a field with such potential for new governance strategies. AllTrails, 100MissouriMiles, and SeeClickFix give citizens the chance to develop community around their public land. Although not every individual is looking for the same experience with their public lands, this space invites a slew of opportunity for engagement. We can think creatively about how people are consuming, presenting, and sharing information, and how it can contribute to increased participation and engagement with our public land.

This is civic tech: When you Google a presidential candidate, campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics comes up automatically. As Google product managers Jacob Schoenberg and Payal Patel explain, Finding information on campaign funding can be difficult, if not seemingly impossible. Today, working with one of the most respected data sources in the industry, the Center for Responsive Politics, were making presidential campaign finance information easy to access and understand, right from Google Search. So when you search for donald trump or clinton campaign finance, youll see a snapshot of their campaigns finance breakdown and be able to dig into interesting insights, like the percentage of funds coming from SuperPACs versus individual donations, or which industries have donated the most to a given candidate. Kudos to CRP!


Heres the transcript of President Obamas appearance at SXSW this past Friday. While Obamas remarks on the topic of encryption dominated the news, he also made a strong pitch for the U.S. Digital Services efforts to modernize how the federal government uses technology. Part of my job is to try to institutionalize that over the next several years, he said, adding, And I want to make sure that the next President and the federal government from here on out is in constant improvement mode and were constantly bringing in new talent and new ideas to solve some of these big problems.

Tech and politics: Zack Exley and Becky Bond, two of the digital organizing veterans currently serving as national advisors to the Bernie Sanders campaign, give a long interview in The Nation to some guy named Sifry about their open-source, distributed, Big Organizing model. Says Exley: Our task was to turn massive amounts of enthusiasm into disciplined volunteer teams capable of accomplishing real objectives set forward by the campaign. And we had to do this before a field structure was put in place that was based on the old, less scalable model!....internet-based campaigns tend to fail to achieve their objectives when they cant leverage the full capacity of all the people who raise their hands and say I want to be involved. Its one thing to crowd-source funding for movement organizing. Its another thing to crowd-source the organizing itself and have valuable work get done at scale by tens of thousands of committed volunteers.


The scale produced so far: 60,000 campaign events run by volunteers, 22,000 phonebanks run by volunteers, 600 Barnstorms filled with hundreds of volunteers, hundreds of Slack teams with tens of thousands of members. (One could argue that Slack is actually the breakout tech tool of 2016.)


As of March 13, as Exley and Bond report, the Sanders campaign machine has made 36 million voter contact calls, running at a pace of one million per night for the last few weeks. (In 2012, the Obama campaign said it made 150 million calls and door-knocks over the entire cycle, built on a staff of 4000.)


The other big platform for Sanders organizing is Facebook, where he has about 165 Facebook Pages with 7.3 million likes, and nearly 200 Facebook Groups with more than 358,000 members; Clintons numbers are roughly half that.


When progressives complain that NationBuilder lets anyone use its voter engagement toolset and voter files, ask them how they feel about progressive Democrat Tim Canova who is being denied access to the VAN voter file and database because he is running against an incumbent, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. (And he sure isnt happy about it.)


Raising eyebrows, Chelsea Clinton is headlining a fundraiser for her mothers campaign at the home of Elizabeth Holmes, the embattled founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, Noah Kulwin reports for Re/Code.

Trump watch: Here are some worrisome signs that Trump supporters are starting to talk about bringing guns to rallies and polling places and taking steps towards forming some kind of Trump militia. If you are trying to follow along in the original German or Italian, once Trump starts embracing a para-military to guard his rallies and spread his movement he will have leveled up to full fascist.


Technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci went to Trumps rally in Fayetteville, and she tells Christopher Woolf of PRI, Its almost a text-book case of the rise of an authoritarian populist movement. But, noting a lack of organization at the rally, she adds, the aftermath of the rally made me think, no, this is so dependent on one persons charismatic connection with a crowd, theres no organization behind it. So I dont think hes going to win the presidency.

The Philippines: Presidential candidates in the Philippines are gearing up for their second debate on March 20. Billed as the Cebu Face-Off, the debate will be held at the University of the Philippines campus in Cebu City and will be hosted by TV5 and the Philippine Star. Independent candidate Sen. Grace Poe said the contenders will remain respectful to each other and decent. 
 It will be a different format, definitely, and shorter commercials, Gregg Lloren, a UP faculty member and event manager for the debate, told Rappler, referring to the 48 minutes of commercials that interrupted the first debate.

The debates, scheduled for March 13-15, will be broadcast by NCN and streamed live at ncnguyana.com. 
This Week in Debates: U.S. News
 Tech Companies Play Big Role in Debates: By now weve gotten so used to Facebook, Google and Twitter logos and mentions during the debates, its easy to forget the inclusion is relatively new. 
 More than half of the sanctioned primary debates this cycle have been co-sponsored by tech companies. Thats more than in 2012 and in 2008, when the only tech-network partnership, between CNN and YouTube, was treated as a novelty, writes David McCabe in The Hill. The companies are also influencing what gets on screen. Google has YouTube stars ask candidates questions and Facebooks data is regularly referenced by debate moderators as a barometer of the public mood. 
 McCabe references the moment when CBS producers pulled a tweet critical of Hillary Clinton during a debate and used it in a follow-up question. Weve got an in-depth interview with Adam Sharp, head of news, government and elections at Twitter, on How Twitter and CBS Found the Voice of the Crowd, and a story on Google putting its star YouTube creators front and center during the debates.
 Behind the Scenes: Jake Tapper and CNNs political team rehearsed for last weeks Republican debate with a series of mock debates that were dialed up a few notches to prepare them for anything that might happen. 
 We cant control when candidates attack each other, but we can at least anticipate when it might happen, CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist told the Los Angeles Times.
 Meanwhile, The Washington Post looks at CBS anchor and debate moderator John Dickersons analytical style and his memorable exchange with Ted Cruz during the Feb. 13 debate over Supreme Court appointments.
 And the A.V. Club takes readers behind the scenes of putting together a presidential debate (and pulling it off without a hitch). Read this Q&A with Randy Trumbull-Holper and Lisa Dickson, both of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Zelazo Center, where Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debated in February. In addition to learning what mag security means, you wont want to miss Clintons personal note to Trumbull-Holpers young son.
 How to Talk to Your Kids About the Debates: The last Republican debate was relatively civilgood news for parents struggling to explain some of the mudslinging in this years presidential debates. They should have ratings at the front of the debates, one parent told NPR. You know: Contains language, and violence, and sexual content.'

 But before getting nostalgic for the days of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, read Harold Holzers look at 19th-century debate zingers. 
 Promoting More Debates at the State Level: A bipartisan group of civic leaders in Washington has formed a coalition to promote free, nonpartisan debates that allow for direct public participation. Organized by Seattle CityClub, the Washington State Debate Coalition has drawn support from area colleges, universities, and media organizations.
 Informed, publicly accessible debates are harder to come by these days, Diane Douglas, executive director of Seattle CityClub, told the Seattle Times.
 The coalition will host U.S. Senate and gubernatorial debates this fall. One of the goals is to get candidates to commit to debatesespecially incumbents or well-known candidates wary of taking part in high-profile events that could help their opponents. (Ohios Ted Strickland might know something about this.)
 Meanwhile, in Milwaukee, televised debates are scheduled this month for that citys mayoral race, as well as for Milwaukee county executive and Wisconsin Supreme Court, a statewide race.

Tech and politics: Using a Facebook event page, Google Docs, and WhatsApp, students at the University of Illinois at Chicago mobilized in less than a week to protest Donald Trumps planned appearance on their campus Friday, as Keith OBrien details for Politico. MoveOn.org and Black Lives Matter also helped organize support, as Kate Linthicum and Kurtis Lee report for the Los Angeles Times. An online petition against the Trump rally started by a UIC graduate student garnered more than 51,000 signatures.


Heres something I didnt know, per Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times: The Trump campaign registers people to attend its rallies on Eventbrite.com and asks only for routine informationname, address and cell number. (More background here.)


Sasha Issenberg digs into the details of the Republican delegate selection process and discovers all kinds of machinations under way that could undermine Donald Trumps campaign. For example, in many states the actual delegates arent picked by the candidate that they are supposedly pledged to, theyre picked by state conventions or executive committees. Issenberg reports that at Ted Cruzs Houston headquarters, a six-person team overseen by political operatives, lawyers, and data analysts is effectively re-enacting the primary calendar, often with the aim of placing double agents in Trump slates.

In the future, this is how the government might tell you your polling place has moved. (Michele Ursino)

After Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of New York and New Jersey in 2012, election officials had to hastily relocate polling places for Election Day, which took place the following week, to replace those made inaccessible by the storm. They didnt have time to notify voters by mail of the change. As a result, many voters were confused about where to go. Some may have skipped the election entirely. This inspired New York Senator Charles Schumer to write legislation requiring states to create disaster contingency plans for national elections. On a local level, it prompted New York City Councilman James Vacca to introduce legislation that would require the New York City Board of Elections to send election notifications to New Yorkers via text and email.
That was in August 2014.
After a year-and-a-half lull, the legislation is back on the agenda, and was among the innovations to increase voter turnout that New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito promised in her State of the City address. (In 2014, only 29 percent of eligible New York State voters went to the pollsthe second-worst voter turnout in the nation.)
In her February address, Mark-Viverito celebrated the innovative strategies used to get New Yorkers to vote in the Participatory Budgeting (PB) process, including reminder texts and emails, and then pledged to push for key innovations that will make it easier to vote in regular elections as well.
Were also going to create voter notifications through email and text messagingjust like weve successfully done with PB, she said. We are going to bring democracy right to your fingertips.
It might have been just the push Vaccas legislation needed. At the end of February, Vaccas bill was one of a number of voting reforms considered at a hearing of the Committee on Governmental Operations.
But the testimony given at the hearing suggests that the road ahead may yet be long and bumpy for an idea that seems simple.
First, Michael Ryan, the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections, testified that the bill changes the duties and responsibilities of the City Board as prescribed by the Election Law and conflicts with existing State Law.
Ryan also pointed out some problems that could arise over the collection of additional informationlike email addressesby the Board of Elections, including the fact that state law does not prohibit the sale of telephone numbers or email addresses for commercial or fundraising purposes.
Henry Berger, special counsel to the mayor, testified that sending text and email notifications about elections is a massive undertaking requiring significant resources, staff, equipment, and technological infrastructure before it can even begin to be realized or implemented. Berger also raised concerns about the scope of the Citys authority over the Board and suggested that the concerns sought to be addressed by the bills could be more appropriately addressed, in cooperation with the administration and Board, outside the legislative process.
Representatives from the Citizens Union of the City of New York and Common Cause both supported the bill. Prudence Katze from Common Cause addressed the New York City Board of Elections directly when she said, we call on the NYC Board to accept the direction from the NYC Council contained in these needed bills and resolutions and to work with every level of government to ensure that voters can receive the best experience possible.
She added, the Boards stubborn insistence that it is not answerable for the way in which it spends tax dollars does it no credit and simply re-enforces the unfortunate public perception that it is an agency that is unresponsive to public concerns.
Seth Flaxman, the co-founder of Democracy Works (and Civic Hall member), also spoke in favor of the idea. The idea of a government sending election reminders or notifications to their constituencies perfectly represents the driving notion behind TurboVotethat voting should fit the way we live.
We are a culture that increasingly lives in our mobile devices, he continued. We expect to be able to access more information in our phones than ever before.
Flaxman also offered some words of advice and caution, suggesting that the city not be excessively prescriptive and to allow room for iteration and a slow roll-out.
In a phone call with Civicist, Flaxman reiterated that technology is usually harder than you think. When the stakes are high, you want to make sure you get it right.
Its not free and its not cheap, Flaxman told Civicist when asked about cost. As for specifics, he hesitantly ventured, I would be surprised if it cost over a million.
But its certainly doable. When Flaxman began working on TurboVote in 2010 with Democracy Works co-founder Kathryn Peters, Peters county clerk in Boone County, Missouri, was already sending email notifications to voters about upcoming elections.
And the demand for a service like this isnt going anywhere. Im one of a million New Yorkers who always checks his texts, Councilman Vacca told Civicist. By using texting and email we can communicate [with voters] much more effectively.
When asked about the executive director of the Board of Elections testimony that the legislation conflicts with state law, Vacca told Civicist, theres nothing that prevents the BOE from doing this administratively, in addition to the requirements laid out by state law.
He added, my understanding is they think this is a very good idea.
The bill will need to go through a process of readjustment now.
I think the Speaker would like to put together a voter engagement package, Vacca said. And I hope that some version of my legislation will be included.
But dont expect texts from the city before you head to the polls this November. Even if the legislation moves quickly from here on out, Flaxman told Civicist that the city would ideally take two years to develop the product.

Presidential candidates join hands at the first presidential debate held in Malawi / Debates International




Case Study: First-Time Presidential Debate
Country: Malawi
Debate: April 22, 2014 (two more debates held April 29 and May 6)

A few hours before he was scheduled to moderate Malawis first-ever presidential debate on April 22, 2014, the Rev. Patrick Semphere received news that four of the 12 candidates, including two of the front-runners, had pulled out.
Though nervous, he stuck to his prepared questions on education and healthcare, after first asking candidates a pointed question about what they would do to turn the country around. 
Later that night, after the candidates held hands on stage as a show of national unity, Semphere, a former chairperson of the Media Council of Malawi, exited the Bingu International Conference Centre in the capital of Lilongwe, overwhelmed with relief.  
It was like I had finished a major exam, he said. The heightened pressure of moderating the first-of-its-kind event, which was not pre-recorded but live, meaning mistakes become cast in stone, was unimaginable.
Semphere need not have worried. Though the election on May 20 was marred by complaints about ballot counts and a delay in announcing the results, political and media analysts consider the debatesthree total for the presidential candidates, held in two different citiesa success, and an appropriate milestone to mark the 50th anniversary of Malawis independence.  
Eleven candidates attended the next two debates (the final one is available on YouTube). Its rare to get so many candidates to attend the first-time effort, said Matt Dippell, National Democratic Institute (NDI) global debate program advisor and deputy director for Latin America and the Caribbean. That was a huge achievement.
Only the incumbent president, Joy Banda, boycotted the entire series, stating she was too busy reaching out to the people to attend. She ended up losing the election to Peter Mutharikathe younger brother of former President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012.
Though the crowded field posed logistical challenges, including debates lasting three hours even though candidates were limited to two-minute responses, it also provided the opportunity to hear from lesser-known candidates who lacked the popularity and media access to make their views known. More broadly, said Dippell, the debates sent a positive message throughout the country that candidates who disagree on policy could engage in civil discourse.
Patrick Semphere during his TEDx Talk on moderating Malawis presidential debates (screenshot).
The debate questions alternated between English, the official language, and Chichewa, which is more commonly spoken, to show that candidates could communicate in both. Two television stations, including the state-run Malawi Broadcasting Corporation, and five radio stations broadcast the debates, with organizers aiming as big a voter education impact as possible, said Dippell.
The candidates were persuaded to take part by the Taskforce on Malawi Presidential Debates, a coalition of media organizations, election observers, and civic, religious, and human rights groups. With funding from the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa and UKAID, and technical assistance from NDI, the Taskforce spent six months working out everything from location and security to the questions the moderator would pose.
By the third debate, Semphere had more confidence in his role, and the candidates were more comfortable, too, even joking with each other on stage. During a TEDx Lilongwe Talk about the debates, Semphere recalled one of the final questions: In the event you win the election, how are you going to use the collective wisdom that weve seen so marvelously during the three debates?
Five months after the election, Mutharika met with some, but not all, of the other candidates.
Social Medias Indirect Role
Taskforce Chairman Anthony Kasunda said one of the conditions for securing the candidates participation was to prohibit direct questioning from audience members, because some presidential candidates felt they may be embarrassed with some of the issues that can randomly come from the public.
We were mindful of the fact that there cannot be debates if the candidates will decline to participate, said Kasunda, who is now the public relations manager for Blantyre City Council (the countrys second largest city). He added, however, that some of the moderators questions were inspired by issues raised in various forums, including on social media.
In Malawi, Facebook has become one of the major forums where the public debate on issues affecting them is done, said Kasunda. One cannot ignore the social platform at the moment. So the team organizing questions took serious notice of the issues raised on the social front.
The number of Malawians using social media is small. In a country with around 17 million people, less than 7 percent have internet access. But many Malawians living in the United States and in other countries turn to Facebook and Twitter to discuss African politics.
Sitinga Kachipande, president of the Malawi Washington Association, said Zodiak Broadcasting Station, which broadcast the presidential debates and organized the running mates debate, making it available via multiple platforms, missed an opportunity to promote a single hashtag rounding up conversations on Twitter. Yet despite the lack of a centralized dialogue, social media proved essential to connecting Malawians to one another, and to the debates.
Kachipande, a Ph.D. student in sociology at Virginia Tech studying Africa and the global political economy, said she and others were pleased that specific issues of concern to Malawians living outside the countrysuch as the topic of dual citizenshipcame up during the debates.
Eddie Namingona, who works for an affordable housing association in D.C. and lives in suburban Maryland, agreed. I could see things that were being discussed on Facebook by Malawians both in the diaspora and those at home were addressed fully during the debates, said Namingona, who listened to the radio broadcast on TuneIn, as did his mother, who was visiting from Malawi at the time.
When he called family in Malawi, the situation was much the same: several households were gathered together, listening to the debate on the radio. For debate discussions, he turned mostly to Facebook and online forums.
Semphere said debate organizers prioritized mastering the basics of the debate over addressing issues raised by the public, but as the debates progressed, it was clear that social media could not be ignored, although we did not have a live feed onto the moderators console.
He suggested that future debate organizers might do more to gather public input via social mediaa recommendation Kasunda also included in his post-election reportbut Semphere cautioned taking questions live.
For me, personally, one would have to tread on this route, carefully considering its vulnerability to abuse. Besides the glamour of instant interactivity, I would wonder what further value would be obtained, said Semphere.
Aubrey Chikungwa, national director of the Malawi chapter of the National Media Institute of Southern Africa, said he could envision presidential debates designed more like the parliamentary debates held around the country. In those debates, candidates vying for parliamentary seats took questions directly from the audience, and the format was more lively and engaging.
The debates empowered the electorate to assess the candidates and elect those deemed competent and suitable for the job, said Chikungwa. They provided a platform for citizens to interview candidates and pick those competent enough to develop the constituencies.

Theres no data on the number of households that listened to or viewed at least one of the presidential debates, but a NDI post-election report based on interviews with 582 people found that the debates played a role in shaping participants views on candidates among those who listened.
According to the report, The debate format allowed them to judge how well candidates could respond to questionssomething not discernible at ralliesand made it easy for them to make a side-by-side comparison of policies. This helped them weigh, participants say, which candidate to support.
Participants also told interviewers that the political discourse during the 2014 election was more substantive than in previous elections, with more discussion of issues important to ordinary citizens and fewer personal attacks.

Those who said they did not listen to the presidential debates identified the primary barrier as the lack of a radio or radio batteries. Radio is Malawis main conduit for connecting news, politicians and citizens across the country, which is the case even in more affluent countries in the region.
The next presidential election isnt until 2019, but some observers question whether internet or mobile access will increase significantly by then. More than 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas, where even electricity is scarce.
Cell phones may be easier to adapt for interactivityin 2014, prospective voters could, for the first time, verify their voter registration status by sending a free text message or by going onlinebut mobile penetration is still below 40 percent. Still, it looks more promising to some observers.
The reality for Malawi is that access to social media is still limited, hence unrepresentative of the majority of the population, said Semphere. However, SMS messaging has broader coverage, and this could yield a more inclusive participation.
A country like Myanmar, which saw a 300-percent increase in smartphone penetration in the last year, is leapfrogging directly to computers in their pockets, said Chris Doten, senior manager for technology and innovation at NDI. Thats not going to happen in Malawi, but NDI looks at different approaches for different audiences.
You cant replace local community radio in local dialects for reaching everyone, but at the same time, connected and often disaffected urban youth are a very important political audience, and they are disproportionately online and on their phones and more versed in these sorts of communication technologies, said Doten, who oversees a five-member tech team that has built a new Democracy Toolkit for NDI partners and civic groups around the world.
He also cited examples of creative, citizen-fueled projects existing outside of typical government avenues, such as The Munathara Initiative, which engages Arab youth through online debate competitions. (NDI has honored Munathara for civic innovation but does not provide funding.) The competitions begin with short video submissions on hot-button topics. In the final round, the winners on each side are paired with a subject matter expert, often a senior government official or political candidate, and the two teams take part in a live, televised debate.
I think there are a lot of interesting opportunities for doing things that engage candidates with the populace in different ways that achieve the same goals of debates, but in slightly different formats, he said.
Boniface Dulani, a senior lecturer in the Department of Political and Administrative Studies at University of Malawi-Chancellor College, said that while social media is becoming more prevalent, especially among youth, it would still be a while before many people could actively engage with presidential debates, assuming there are opportunities to do so. Uploading video questions to be broadcast during a debate, for example, or even livestreaming the event, would be difficult because internet speeds are so slow.
He encouraged something more basic: Debate organizers could tour the country and ask about key issues in person, and then take questions from the public back to the candidates.  
Steve Sharra, an expert on education and technology access in Malawi who recently returned to the country following a stint as a visiting scholar at University of Botswana, suggested something similar, noting that perhaps Zodiak Broadcasting Station could go into villages, record peoples questions, and make them part of the debate. The debates could also be broadcast at a local schoolor shown at a later date, during the daytime when it might be easier to travelwith a speaker on hand to guide discussion. 
But Sharra sees another obstacle to increasing engagement: language.
To increase civic participation, citizens need access to information. Yet only a small percentage of people in Malawiperhaps 10 percent, he estimatesread English, the language used by the government and the countrys print news media. His suggestion: start translating more information into local languages (mostly Chichewa).
The language situation is very disappointing, and I dont see how democracy can thrive if we continue placing dependency on English. We need to continue using English, but we need to improve how to promote our local language, said Sharra. If we had a newspaper that published every day with intellectual content in local languages, that would go a long way toward increasing democratic participation. 
In a country where presidential debates are just taking hold, the most innovative tool for increasing engagement may be a combination of many.

This is civic tech: Inspired by a talk by Magdelin Vargas and Chanda Fruchter of NYC 311 that she heard at last Saturdays School of Data, programmer Aliza Aufrichtig built a Chrome extension that shows would-be renters every 311 complaint lodged against the address they are exploring.

Starbucks is partnering with Turbovote in an effort to encourage all of its 150,000 U.S. employees to register to vote, Daniel Lippman reports for Politico. (Kudos to Seth Flaxman, Turbovote co-founder and Civic Hall member!)


Google.org, the companys charitable arm, gives away $100 million a year. Jacquelline Fuller, its director, tells Davey Alba of Wired that its focused on an evidence-based approach to taking bigger risks aimed at bigger impact. She says, Theres big thinking, [while] theres so much incremental thinking in the nonprofit and foundation world. [The foundation world] is so focused on, Fed X number of people today. Can we feed X+1 tomorrow? As opposed to asking: Wheres the path that can get us to X squared?


Big thinks: Odds are, this morning, that your Twitter feed is telling you to hurry up and read Jeffrey Goldbergs new Atlantic cover story on The Obama Doctrine, the presidents approach to foreign affairs. Ill save you some time, because its almost 20,000 words long: Obama has a nuanced view of Americas power to bring order to the world, and hes less of an interventionist than Hillary Clinton.


Obama also has a very interesting observation about the march of human progress, which he applies to the current breakdown in the Middle East, but which could be also read through the lens of current events here in the United States:
I believe that overall, humanity has become less violent, more tolerant, healthier, better fed, more empathetic, more able to manage difference. But its hugely uneven. And what has been clear throughout the 20th and 21st centuries is that the progress we make in social order and taming our baser impulses and steadying our fears can be reversed very quickly. Social order starts breaking down if people are under profound stress. Then the default position is tribeus/them, a hostility toward the unfamiliar or the unknown. Right now, across the globe, youre seeing places that are undergoing severe stress because of globalization, because of the collision of cultures brought about by the Internet and social media, because of scarcitiessome of which will be attributable to climate change over the next several decadesbecause of population growth. And in those places, the Middle East being Exhibit A, the default position for a lot of folks is to organize tightly in the tribe and to push back or strike out against those who are different.


Obama also understands very well the value that civil society brings: Right now, I dont think that anybody can be feeling good about the situation in the Middle East, he said. You have countries that are failing to provide prosperity and opportunity for their people. Youve got a violent, extremist ideology, or ideologies, that are turbocharged through social media. Youve got countries that have very few civic traditions, so that as autocratic regimes start fraying, the only organizing principles are sectarian. Contrast that with Southeast Asia, which still has huge problemsenormous poverty, corruptionbut is filled with striving, ambitious, energetic people who are every single day scratching and clawing to build businesses and get education and find jobs and build infrastructure. The contrast is pretty stark.


Notably: the phrase internet freedom never gets mentioned. Remember when that was a thing the Obama administration cared about? Now, not so much. (Somewhere between the souring of the Arab Spring and the disclosures by Edward Snowden, it got dropped.)

This is civic tech: The White House has launched The Opportunity Project, with a focus on making local and federal datasets easily sortable and available online, so developers can combine them to build new civic tech tools to improve the relationship between cities and their citizens, as Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired. According to U.S. chief data scientist DJ Patil, the idea for the effort came from President Obama, who will talk more on the topic of tech and government at SXSW this weekend.


The projects website is a civic tech playhouse, with several new projects showcased that make innovative use of open government data to help people navigate their communities more effectively, including a tool from Redfin showing users nearby jobs they can get to without a car and a tool from Azalea showing transit access to community resources like day care, health care, Head Start, playgrounds and recreation centers.

There are huge benefits to having a new class of technically able, socially aware, financially successful, and highly energetic people like Mark Zuckerberg taking over functions and economic power from some of the staid, politically entrenched, and occasionally corrupt gatekeepers we have had in the past. But we ought to be aware, too, that this cultural, economic, and political shift is profound.

President, May I Ask a Question platform at taiwan.wethepeople.tw




Case Study: President, May I Ask a Question, a crowdsourcing platform that gathered questions from the public
Country: Taiwan
Debate: Vice-Presidential Debate, Dec. 26, 2015; Presidential Debate, Jan. 2, 2016

On Jan. 16, voters in Taiwan elected their first female president, Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, giving her and her party a commanding victory that could potentially alter the course of Taiwans relationship with China.
Voters also took part in another election first: They posed questions to presidential and vice-presidential candidatesand they got answers.
Google set up an election hub with information on the candidates, similar to what it had done in 2014. But this time, working with Watchout, an organization known for launching civic tech projects, and Apple Daily, Taiwans second-largest newspaper, Google developed a platform to crowdsource questions for the candidates. The site translates to President, May I Ask a Question.
Candidates today want to hear from voters directly about their priorities and concerns, and citizens want their voices to be heard, said Joy Albert, communications and public affairs manager for Google Asia Pacific.
The set-up was straightforward: After clicking the I want to ask button, users could enter their query under more than a dozen categories, including education, economy, labor, and health and welfare. Other users could like the question and share it. The platform received a total of 6,500 questions that attracted 220,000 votes.
Six questions were included in the only scheduled vice-presidential debate, and five questions were posed to presidential candidates during the second of two scheduled debates. The three presidential candidates could also answer questions on the site itself. (You can view some of the responses at the bottom of the homepage.)
The platform at elections.withgoogle.com/taiwan2016/your-voice Site visitors can filter by category and see which candidates responded to which questions.
I dont think weve seen this level of direct engagement between voters and presidential candidates in Taiwan before, said Albert.
The site launched in October, about six weeks ahead of the official start to the presidential campaignwhich lasts only 28 days from beginning to end. Users could access the platform via Googles election site or at taiwan.wethepeople.tw, run by Watchout, which had initiated a similar platform around the Tapei mayoral election in 2014. There was also a dedicated Facebook page for the project that earned more than 3,500 likes.
Albert said Google partnered with Watchout and Apple Daily to reach more citizens. We all recognized that encouraging more voters to participate and submit questions would mean a more active and inclusive conversation, and would contribute to a lively televised presidential debate.
Determining which questions would be asked during the debates was left somewhat to chance. In late December, Watchout spokesperson Zuyi Lin said questions would be selected by lottery, and only those questions that received more than 1,000 votes would be considered for the debates.
Taiwans press reported that representatives for all three of the presidential candidateswhich in addition to Tsai included Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) candidate Eric Chu and People First Party (PFP) candidate James Soongreadily agreed to the format and selection process.
Each question will be answered by all three candidates, which the KMT finds fair and supports 100 percent, said Chus campaign spokesperson, Hsu Chiao-hsin.
It allows people to directly participate in public affairs through the internet, which is why it can best represent a diversity of public opinions, said Alex Huang, the DPPs Department of News and Information director.
PFP spokesperson Clarence Wu noted that internet media is changing our political system. He referenced European countries in which the parliament will debate questions that receive the support of at least 10,000 people, and added: If this kind of system is implemented in Taiwan, it has the potential to change Taiwans political system.
Young Voters and Civic Tech
Beginning in 2014, political parties started to focus more resources on connecting with votersespecially younger votersthrough different mediums, said Gwenyth Wang, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Warwick who is based in Taipei and writes frequently about politics.

The parties had come to realize that younger voters were not as apolitical as was once thought. In early 2014, the student-led Sunflower Movement took hold, protesting the lack of transparency in trade negotiations with China. The protests included a 23-day occupation of Taiwans legislature, the largest anti-China demonstration in years. When protesters briefly took over Taiwans main government offices, police, armed with batons and water cannons, pushed them out, injuring nearly 200 people. In November of that year, the ruling KMT party suffered a massive defeat in the local electionsa sign of the uprooting that would occur in the presidential and legislative races in 2016.
The youth vote was a crucial part of this election cycle because the youth vote played an enormous part the 2014 election cycle, said Aaron Wytze Wilson, a journalist in Taiwan who has researched and reported on Taiwans developing open-government and civic-tech movements.
Efforts to reach out to voters increased further in the lead-up to the presidential election. Taiwans Central Election Commission estimated that 18.8 million people would be eligible to voteand 1.29 million would be first-time voters who had reached age 20, the voting age minimum (two years older than it is most countries).
Wilson also noted that Taiwan has experienced a bit of a civic-tech boom over the past several years, as organizations such as g0v and Watchout have developed tools and apps to help increase citizen engagement. (Heres an early version of the Mayor, May I Ask a Question platform during a g0v hackathon in February 2014.) These projects have been embraced by young and middle-aged citizens, and President, May I Ask a Question fit right in.  
Chieh-Ting Yeh, co-founder of Ketagalan Media, which covers news and culture in Taiwan, said he views the platform as a product of increased youth engagement in the election as much as a contributor, since the youth in Taiwan has in recent years become much more interested in public affairs.
I think the fundamental issue in Taiwan is that the youth is facing economic challenges like stagnant growth, high property prices and income inequality, and the youth came to see the ruling KMTs policy of staking Taiwans economy on China as the main culprit. I think these issues with the youth are global, and I wouldnt be surprised to see similar platforms pop up in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, or even here in the U.S., added Yeh, who is based in San Francisco.
Johnson Liang, a g0v participant in Taiwan, said President, May I Ask a Question helped to make the debates more trustworthy and, as a result, more interesting to watch. He recalled that in 2014, supporters of Ko Wen-je, an independent candidate who defeated KMT candidate Sean Lien in the Taipei mayoral race, thought the debate questions directed toward Ko were surprisingly harsh. Some voters lost faith in the impartiality of the civic group representatives that ask questions during debates.
President, May I Ask a Question allows citizens to participate in the generation process of the questions, which is somewhat more accountable than the citizen representatives, said Liang, who created a platform of his own during the election, Political Promises in 2016 Presidential Election, a reference site for learning what candidates said during a campaign.
Political Promises is hosted on hacktabl.org, a tool that generates comparison tables based on Google docs. Liang invited g0v participants to fill in all the proposals candidates made throughout the campaign, with each one linked to source material from the candidates websites. At the end of the election, nearly 400 ideas had been cataloged in a by more than 15 collaborators on topics including cross-strait relations, national finances, and industry policies.
It would be a pity if proposals from the election losers just disappearthese ideas might be a good alternative if the winners proposals fail, said Liang.
A Mix of Questions

Besides being featured on Googles election hub and on Watchout, President, May I Ask a Question was promoted on Apple Dailys website, one of the most popular news sites in Taiwan. Observers agreed that Google and Apple Daily gave the platform more legitimacy in the debates. But even if they hadnt been involved, said Wilson, there would still be a high level of acceptance for this kind of project from the general populace.
That said, he was somewhat surprised the site didnt show bigger engagement numbers. Wilson said the most popular question, concerning the candidates stance on same-sex marriage, received around 2,600 votes. Though the economy is a major national issue, other questions in the top five dealt with the one-China principle, sex education, nuclear power, and debt incurred by local governments. 
None of those questions were selected in the lottery. Instead, the presidential candidates fielded questions on internet access and the digital divide, the power of judges with lifetime appointments, pension reform, monetary policy and Taiwans economic woes, and the failure of the Labor Standards Act to cover employees of small and medium-sized businesses.

At the vice-presidential debate, the questions addressed legislative election cycles, foreign policy and Taiwans soft power (including medical and humanitarian aid), control over cultural policies and budgets, transportation project funding, national policy and self-determination, and consequences for legislators with poor attendance records.
The quality of the questions varied, said Wang. A question during the presidential debate that asked how the candidates would reform Taiwans Central Bankbased on the assumption the bank was responsible for poor policy decisionsled nowhere. 
As the question itself came with a controversial presumption, none of the candidates agreed that the Central Bank had conducted wrongful policies and declined to give further comments on the question. In this case, it did not really help improve the quality of the debate discourse, said Wang. I would say, as this is the first time for Taiwans presidential/vice presidential debates to include questions posed by netizens, there is still room for Taiwanese people to learn how to participate in political discourse in the future. 
Overall, however, she praised President, May I Ask a Question for elevating political participation, noting that it helped broaden conversation around domestic issues of direct concern to voters. For instance, said Wang, candidates were questioned on traffic and labor rights, which were closely related to Taiwanese peoples everyday life.
Yeh agreed that the questions were a welcome addition to the debates, noting that at the very least, they provided an opportunity for direct engagement. The fact that this avenue of reaching the candidates was available made the candidates feel much more close to an individual voter, said Yeh. He submitted a question himself, asking whether the candidates would be in favor of revising the constitution to a parliamentary system.
During the debates, news presenters asked the questions from the public. The number of votes (or co-signers) a question received was sometimes visible onscreen while the question was being read. All of the debates were co-sponsored by Central News Agency, Public Television Service, Sanlih E-Televison (SET-TV), Google, Watchout, and four major Chinese-language newspapers: the Liberty Times, Apple Daily, United Daily News, and China Times.  
The Liberty Times reported that the second presidential debate achieved a record-high rating for televised debates in Taiwan. Still, voter turnout was only 66.27 percentthe lowest turnout since the 1996, the first year the office of president was directly elected by voters. Going into the election, polls showed Tsai with a wide lead over both her opponents. Wilson and others suggested that engagementboth on the President, May I Ask a Question platform and at the pollsmight have been down because it was clear from early on that Tsai would win. 
Theres one more way of measuring the impact of President, May I Ask a Question. Following KMTs devastating defeat, civic groups affiliated with the party organized a forum in February for party chair hopefuls to discuss their plans for the future and to answer questions from the public. The forum was titled Chairperson, May I Ask a Question.

For more on this subject:debates: http://civichall.org/topic/debates/ 


Shortly after the start of his campaign during the 2012 Mexican presidential election, then-candidate Enrique Pena Nieto (EPN) rose to Twitter dominance almost overnight. To some savvy internet sleuths, this seemed a bit suspicious. Sure enough, people quickly discovered the presence of a large army of Twitter accounts dedicated to producing a continuous stream of praise for EPN. These accounts came to be known as the first Penabots. Since then, the term Penabot has evolved to have a variety of meanings. They are either automated software that requires no human intervention, low-wage workers paid by the government to operate multiple social media accounts (think Chinese 50 Cent Party), or even genuine supporters who are criticized for their mindless support of Pena Nieto (think Limbots or Obamabots). These first two applications of the term bot present a lot of ethical questions over the use of bots by the government.
Since the first discovery of Penabots, the government has deployed their bot army several times. Often they did so to create the false impression that Pena Nieto enjoyed much more support than he actually had, such as the aforementioned case that led to the discovery of the bots. Another tactic the government employs to create fake support is to automatically retweet government officials. In 2013, there were reports that bots had been retweeting Pena Nietos tweets on energy reform. A common practice among multiple government officials has been to pad the their follower count by buying fake Twitter followers.
The governments tactics got more questionable once they began using bots to drown out oppositional tweets. Near the end of the election, a video surfaced showing a room full of people with computers being directed to tweet in coordination with the explicit goal to drown out an anti-EPN hashtag. This was the first of several attempts by the government to crowd out an anti-government hashtags. In response to the video, a marketing coordinator for the EPN campaign admitted to employing over 20,000 people to launch coordinated attacks against offending hashtags. A similar attack happened in the state of Tabasco where, after a brief period in the trending topic list, the hashtag #MarchaAntiEPN (March Against EPN) was bumped off and replaced with #TodoTabascoConEPN (All of Tabasco With EPN).
The use of bots did not end after Pena Nieto was elected president. It seems that nowadays bots are used to drown out any sort of negative attention on Twitter. In the summer of 2015, a scandal broke out involving EPNs niece. Reports claimed she had been hired for a managerial position at PEMEX despite lacking any experience for the role. Regardless of the veracity of the claims, #SobrinaEPN (EPN niece) quickly trended. But the bots sprung into action, and the hashtag was soon eliminated from the trending topic list by a deluge of junk tweets.
 Source: Aristegui Noticias
Sometimes the reason a trending topic gets knocked off the list is not so clear. Such was the case in November 2014 in which #YaMeCanse (Im tired), the hashtag used to protest the disappearance of 43 students in September of that year, was knocked off the list after trending for a month. Immediately there were cries of censorship and accusations of Penabots stifling free speech. However, the reason #YaMeCanse de-trended may be more complex than the bot explanation. A similar situation occurred in the US when Twitter was accused of censorship after #OWS stopped trending. This brought to light the complexity of the Twitter algorithm, which searches for burstiness, or spikes, of terms in the stream of tweets. After trending for a month, its very possible that even though the volume of #YaMeCanse tweets was high, it was not bursty enough for the algorithm to pick it up. It may be that those who decided #YaMeCanse should no longer trend were not the Mexican government, but Twitter itself through the use of its algorithms.
While you could make the case that some of the above examples could be classified as legitimate campaign tactics, those tactics, which purposefully drown out the opposition, can be considered morally ambiguous. But where do you draw the line?
Is paying 20,000 people to drown out the opposition any different than using a bot?
Does Twitters lax policy on bots make their use fair game? After all, activists also use bots. But what are the resources of an activist compared to those of the state? And unlike the government bots attempts to muffle speech, usually an activists purpose is either to spread a political message or to cast light on previously unknown information.
Perhaps the activists immediate reaction to blame Penabots for taking down #YaMeCanse is a kind of reverse boy who cried wolf: bot attacks have become so common that any suspicious pro-government message is expected to originate from a bot. Even genuine EPN sympathizers are now called Penabots. It is slightly ironic that in an attempt to pass fake support off as real, the governments use of bots has now rendered any real support fake.
 There are many of us who support Pena bip bip brrrt.
Points/talking bots: Rise of the Penabots is an output of a weeklong workshop at Data & Society that was led by Provocateur-in-Residence Sam Woolley and brought together a group of experts to get a better grip on the questions that bots raise. More posts from workshop participants talking bots:

Erin Vilardi at work in the earliest days of Civic Hall.
Civic Hall is a beautiful space, centrally located in Manhattan with a Fifth Avenue view to die for (office space youd never be able to afford on your own in this real estate market!). But most impressive is the vibrant community of innovatorsfrom the leadership to the regular guestswho care deeply about our democracy and are willing try new ways to improve, digitize, and date-drive it.
Ive been a community member since Civic Hall opened a year ago, and as VoteRunLead graduates to our fellowship at BeeSpace, I want to offer some words of advice for people seeking to get the most out of their Civic Hall membership.


Get to know the Civic Hall team
Whether its a sit-down with Andrew Rasiej or Micah Sifry, Civic Halls co-founders, or a side table chat with community director Jenn Shaw, each member of the Civic Hall team contributed to VoteRunLeads success in concrete ways. Andrew made introductions to new supporters, Micah nominated us for BeeSpace (which VoteRunLead won!) and Jenn helped me find my new Chief Product Officer. Of course, I cant forget Kamila Karwel and Karima Belhachmi! You want to get in their good graces for the quiet heads up when there is food in the kitchen.




Interrupt the community (within reason)
Turn to your neighbor and bother them. Ask them what they do or if you can see their demo. Even if it doesnt seem like a match today, you are setting yourself up to become a human hyperlink within the community. Say hello in the halls and hold the door before the bathroom. You will find strange bedfellows of the best kind. VoteRunLead partnered with Veracity Media for a fantastic event in August; I was introduced to and joined the FWD.US Innovation Council on Civic Halls blue couches, and we look forward to partnering with NYC Veterans Alliance, a member-scholarship recipient.




Name-drop Civic Hall
Use it in your grant proposals. Get in the weekly Civic Hall newsletter. Consider it an endorsement. Leverage it for your brandit tells folks that you are a certain type of innovator. Seriously. Name drop Civic Hall at least once a week! If youre new to this community (like I was), you are getting a kind of all-access pass to the dynamic network that Micah and Andrew have built over the last decade in New York City and across the nation. Dont waste it!




Go to #CivicWomen
Started by Civic Halls founding COO Heidi Sieck (and VoteRunLead Advisory Board Member), #CivicWomen is where its at. Smart, interesting, diverse, #badass ladies who are as quick to talk about data-driven decisions for NASA as they are about mansplaining in the tech sector. There is wealth of knowledge in this community, a safety in sharing your insecurities, and a willingness to see one another for our full selves. Its more than refreshing; its a model for womens leadership. And yes, men are welcome!




Read your daily updates!
Whether its Civicists First Post morning digest or the members-only weekly newsletter, open up that email! Learn who the new members are, see what potential supporters and donors might be in the space that week, and RSVP for really great events in advance. When you can, ping the new members to congratulate them. Spend 10 minutes every day reading the morning news roundup (I read at least one full article on the spot). On more than one occasion, Ive sent an article from Civicist to a donor or potential supporter. This is how you show and share your thought leadership, while supporting theirs.


Finally, the Kitchen. Its not just fab Italian coffee and the occasional free foodthough those are awesomeits also where the best networking happens. Lunch and linger when you can!

Right now the FBI is falling far short, trivializing the risk to the rest of us when backdoors are created and used at scale.

Ever since the fall, when it started to become apparent that Donald Trump was more than a vanity presidential candidate seeking to inflate his name recognition and pad his book sales, some Republicans have raised their voices against him. Most notable has been the effort by Liz Mair, a former Republican National Committee online communications director and adviser to several past presidential contenders. In November, she launched the Make America Awesome Again PAC to run negative ads against him in early states, but had lots of trouble raising moneyin part because Trump did his best to intimidate potential donors and in part because conventional wisdom still held that once GOP voters were actually paying attention, theyd take the choice more seriously and stop dallying with Trump. As Michael Turk, who ran the Bush-Cheney 2004 e-campaign commented to me, All the brightest minds in the GOP spent a year saying Hell drop in the polls. The other candidates will bow out and hell be overtaken. Hes a brief flash of celebrity-obsessed non-voters.' 
In the last few days, the mood among many Republicans has shifted dramatically. Nothing shows this better than the explosive take-off of the hashtag #NeverTrump, which reported had as many as 500,000 uses last weekend. Whats important about its rise isnt just the various rightwing influentials who have started using itamong them, Marco Rubio, Erick Erickson, Mona Charen, Glenn Beck, and Amanda Carpenter. Whats important is that it is surfacing and normalizing the idea among many Republicans that they are not alone in deciding that they will never vote for Trump.
Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle made this crystal clear, when she asked on Twitter whether #NeverTrump was a real thing, and got deluged by emails from Republicans saying they would stay home or vote for another party for the first time if Trump was the GOP nominee. She writes:
These people are not quietly concerned about Trump. They are appalled, repulsed, afraid and dismayed that their party could have let this happen. They wrote in the strongest possible language, and many were adamant that they would not stay home on Election Day, but in fact would vote for Hillary Clinton in the general and perhaps leave the Republican Party for good.....I got everything from college students to Midwestern farmers to military intelligence officers to former officials in Republican administrations, one of whom said he would tattoo #NeverTrump on a rather delicate part of his anatomy if it would keep Donald J. Trump from becoming the nominee. They were from all segments of the partyurban professionals, yes, but also stalwart evangelicals, neoconservatives, libertarians, Tea Partiers, the whole patchwork of ideological groups of which the Republican coalition is made.
Right now, as I write this during my lunch hour here on the East Coast, people are using the hashtag on Twitter at the rate of once every 1.6 seconds, according to Seen.co, which would translate to about 54,000 uses in 24 hours if it stays at that rate. This is a movement-making moment. (For comparison, according to a new in-depth study of the Black Lives Matter movement, after some early efforts to popularize the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in the summer of 2013, it first took off in November 2014 after a St. Louis grand jury declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown. In one day, more than 103,000 tweets appeared using the hashtag, and the movement was on its way.)
#NeverTrump could be a turning point, in terms of crystallizing a reaction building among grassroots Republicans who understand why Trumps rise is so dangerous. And by surfacing the conversation already underway, it might also help these voters get ready to do what they are just now starting to honestly contemplate, which is to cross party linesin a very divided countryin order to keep Trump out of the White House. As the responses to McArdles query show, for many traditional Republican voters, this is a huge leap. To wit, the person who told her: I assume Clinton would crush Trump in a landslide, but if it is actually close, I will not vote third party. I will instead get blackout drunk, hold my nose, and vote for Hillary. Seeing that they arent alone among their peers, the way that sharing the Human Rights Campaigns Equality Now equals-sign symbol on Facebook helped mainstream that idea, can matter a lot.
But while movements can start in a flash, they dont last without organizers and organization. In 1998, MoveOn, the eight-million-member online progressive behemoth, started when computer entrepreneurs Wes Boyd and Joan Blades, whose company made screensaver apps like the flying-toaster-ovens, got fed up with all the calls for then-President Bill Clinton to be impeached in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. They wrote a brief petition titled Censure and Move On, calling on Congress to vote to censure Clinton (a lesser punishment) and get back to the nations business. They circulated it to 100 friends by email, never expecting what happened next. Their call struck a chord, and within a week they had more than 100,000 email signatures. A half million ultimately signed it. That, plus a similarly spontaneous anti-war petition after 9/11, written by then-college student Eli Pariser, which garnered 500,000 signatures over a weekend, is what formed the base for MoveOns subsequent role as a progressive organizing and fundraising machine.
#NeverTrump could be something similar. But so far, the main instigators working in this issue space arent doing much to build broad organization. Right now, Make America Awesome, Mairs group, is circulating a wordy petition aimed at getting the American Conservative Union to disinvite Trump from its annual CPAC conference. Thats a campaign tactic, little more. Aaron Gardner, a conservative activist who recently wrote a tough piece for The Resurgent on how to defeat Trump, seems more interested in creating a new party out of the ashes of the current one than in turning the hashtag into a movement. He tells me, Those of us who have declared #NeverTrump hope that if Trump should win the nomination a new party would arise with the ability to have a built in base of support. We believe in timeless principles and understand that party infrastructures come and go while those principles remain. There are groups out there that exist today which have an edge already on capturing voters for this potential new party.
Gardner adds, What is important to understand at this stage is that #NeverTrump represents a real sentiment shared by a plurality, if not a majority, of the GOP base. It isnt going away. Not after the results come in tonight, and not when the convention is held later this year. Weve taken our stand, it is #NeverTrump.
It remains to be seen if a plurality or majority of Republicans will really reject Trump. It could be the most important question of 2016.

Election 2016 





Crypto-wars, continued: A federal judge in New York has given Apple a major legal victory, ruling against the governments request in a drug case that it be forced to help extract data from a locked iPhone, Glenn Greenwald and Jenna McLaughlin report for The Intercept. The ruling suggests the government is over-reaching in its demand that Apple unlock the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters.


The ACLUs chief technologist, Chris Soghoian, explains in the Washington Post why the FBIs insistence on forcing Apple to write software to crack open a terrorists iPhone imperils the cybersecurity regime that now protects most of our software.


Birth of a movement: Academics Deen Freelon, Charlton Mcilwaine and Meredith Clark have published an incredibly detailed in-depth study of the Black Lives Matter online movement, derived from examining more than 40 million tweets using hashtags related to the movement, 100,000 related web links and interviews with top BLM activists and allies. One fascinating finding: while the term Black Lives Matter was first used in July 2013 after the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon Martin killing, and it was used again in the wake of the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown the following summer, it first penetrated beyond activist circles around the announcement that the St. Louis grand jury would not indict police officer Darren Wilson. That day, use of the hashtag soared to more than 103,000. The report breaks the rise of #BlackLivesMatter into several distinct episodic sections, each one with its own social network diagram describing the involvement and connections between grouping like black celebrities, mainstream news, the mostly white left, the multiracial left, Anonymous, and conservatives opposed to the movement.


Related: Black Lives Matter Twitter activist DeRay Mckesson has hired Revolution Messaging, the same digital firm working for Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, to handle his online fundraising, Darren Sands reports for BuzzFeed.


Tech and politics: Bernie Sanders is a micromanager, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Gabriel Debenedetti report for Politico. For most of the campaign, there wasnt an email, mailer or anything bigger than a tweet that went out without his sign-off. Their story on Sanders chaotic rise makes clear that his team is set on going all the way to the Democratic convention.


Trump watch: Bloomberg View columnist Megan McArdle asked online for lifelong Republicans to write her if they were joining the #NeverTrump movement and the hundreds of responses she got are quite amazing. (Someone should start a Tumblr for these kinds of statements: Donald Trump Scares Me So Much, Im Voting for a Democrat for President. And since McArdle posted the entire trove of emails she received, anonymized, maybe someone will do that.)


On the other hand, close to 20,000 registered Democrats in Massachusetts have switched their party registration to Republican since the beginning of January, Matt Stout reports for the Boston Herald, a trend that Secretary of State William Galvin is most likely connected to the Trump phenomenon.


Media matters: Medium is trying something new: a two-week long community-wide conversation on the topic of criminal justice reform, followed by a live-blogged town hall on March 9-10. Weber Shandwicks Mike Connery offers some commentary on the initiative, suggesting that it could be valuable if it somehow punctures the filter bubble around crime issues.


Lila Tretikov, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, resigned from that position on Thursday, Joe Mullin reports for ArsTechnica. The foundation, which runs Wikipedia, has been rocked with controversy recently over internal conflicts and community complaints about a $250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation to create a knowledge engine to improve how the site handles search.

Movement Netlab's Gan Golan helped organize the arts contingent for the People's Climate March, a hub that has continued organizing independently after the march. (Photo: Robert van Waarden)

If you ask activists where they organize online, youre almost guaranteed to hear them recite familiar, name-brand platforms: Facebook, Google, Twitter. They might extol the platforms virtues, or they might grimace and say grudgingly that they have to go where the people are, but for better or worse, social movements and campaigns like Black Lives Matter, the Fight for $15, and Strike Debt are reliant on commercial social networks.
Yet Gan Golan, an artist and activist, argues that these platforms are not enough. The tools that these social movements need to function do not actually exist, he told Civicist last year. People are organizing right now ahead of where the technology is.
Golan and his colleagues at the activist-led think-make-and-do tank Movement Netlab have set their sights on fixing that.
In January, the group officially partnered with the technology worker cooperative Glocal to build Liberation.Network, an open-source network of networks that they believe can help solve one of the biggest problems they have encountered within decentralized movements like Occupy: group-to-group communication.
If everything goes well, Liberation.Network could become a place where participants from different but interrelated movements could connect and collaborate online. Of course, different levels of cross-movement support already exist. For example, 2014 protests in Ferguson, MO, prompted Palestinians to reach out to protesters via Twitter with advice on protecting oneself from teargas; activists from the climate movement showed their support by organizing a contingent to travel to the city for Ferguson October. But Movement Netlab members believe that there are untapped stores of solidarity that a platform like Liberation.Network could help unleash. The goal is to move conversations currently happening in silosin private Facebook groups or email threads, for exampleto someplace accessible to the entire network of social movements.
Movimiento Cosecha, a movement for migrant rights, and If Not Now, a movement to end the American Jewish communitys support for Israels occupation of Palestine, are the first groups to sign up for Movement Netlabs Liberation.Network. Movement Netlab plans to onboard them this spring.
By and for activists
Sam Corbin, Gan Golan, and Tammy Shapiro founded Movement Netlab in 2013. The three met during Occupy Wall Street and stayed in each others circles after the movement was almost-universally said to have dissolved. Then Hurricane Sandy hit and they saw the Occupy network in New York re-coalesce as Occupy Sandy and provide a grassroots relief effort that put the official response by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Red Cross to shame.
We were amazed at what we achieved but still had no coherent way to explain what we did or how we did it, Gan Golan told Civicist. Articulating an explanation was one of the first things Golan and company tasked themselves with upon starting Movement Netlab. But their long-term goal is to build the tools needed to support and grow todays social movements.
Since the founding members started Movement Netlab in 2013 the core group has grown from three to six. In addition to concept development, they have working groups tackling: trainings for activists; digital tool development, including Liberation.Network; research into funding for movements; and research into how they might replicate Spains success electing candidates from insurgent parties like Podemos. (Last May, Tammy Shapiro and Pablo Benson, one of the newest members of Movement Netlab, traveled to Spain with representatives from labor unions, the Working Families party, and community organizations like the Mayday Space to meet with movement leaders.)
Although much of their work can sound rather academic, Movement Netlab is run by and for activists and is focused on practical solutions. We offer ourselves up to anything that we see as a genuine social movement...from climate justice to racial justice to economic justice, Golan told Civicist.
Platform under construction
Liberation.Network will be built on top of Glocals Activist Network Platform, a pre-configured WordPress multisite that consists of a single umbrella site and an unlimited number of sub-sites that feed information to the main site. The platform consists of a number of open-source tools that can be assembled like widgets as part of a bigger package.
A map of the Activist Network Platform. The main website would be Liberation.Networks homepage; Cosecha and If Not Now will each have a sub-network main site and a number of sub-sites for smaller groups within the movement, like Cosecha Boston or If Not Now Arts. (Glocal)

Each sub-site will have features like a blog, an event calendar, and display feeds for social media accounts. The main Liberation.Network site will display aggregated news from the sub-sites in the network. Glocal can also activate a number of optional features for site managers, including CiviCRM (Constituent Relationship Management), discussion groups, and cloud tools.
One way to understand what Liberation.Network will be able to do is to compare it to the Peoples Climate March hubs platform, a project pitched to the Peoples Climate March organizing body by Movement Netlab and spearheaded by Tammy Shapiro. The hubs were groups organized around geographic-, religious-, or issue-based identities. Each hub had its own website with a blog and links to a Facebook group or a sign up page for the hubs listserv, if applicable. The hubs were listed on the PeoplesClimate.org hubs homepage, which served as a directory. (Since my piece about the hubs platform was published in May 2015, the hubs directory has apparently been taken offline, as have all of the individual hubs websites.)
One of the things the hubs homepage could not do is show what each hub was doing, or what the network was doing collectively. Without visiting a specific hubs homepage or Facebook group, a member of one hub had no way of finding out what another hub had planned, or of communicating strategies, tips, or anything else. This was by design; the Peoples Climate March organizing body had planned to organize for one thing and one thing only. But it did make it nearly impossible for the hubs to work together to organize outside of or after the march. (Although it is hard to tell if there was much demand for that, until at least last August some people continued to organize within their hubs.)
That is what Shapiro argues is Liberation.Networks biggest contribution to the activists digital toolset: the ability for New York activists working on an issue, like climate justice, to share what they are doing with climate activists in Alaska, or New Mexico, or even Spain. And Liberation.Network aspires to broaden that network even further, to make it possible for climate activists to collaborate and share their work with activists working on criminal justice, immigration reform, worker rights, or other progressive causes that fall within Movement Netlabs definition of a genuine social movement.

The early adopters
For If Not Now, which Tammy Shapiro helped start in 2014, that promised connection to the broader world of social movements is one of the bonuses of joining Liberation.Network.
One of the principles of If Not Now is to show up for other movements, Emily Mayer, an If Not Now organizer, told Civicist. Movement Netlab is offering a way to be connected in a super visible way.
But initial interest in the platform, Mayer said, stemmed from a desire to connect people, [and] to have this cross-pollination of ideas across local, geographic relationships...its really useful to have a platform where people from the arts group in Michigan can talk to the people from the arts group in San Francisco. Mayer also said that she wants to use the platform to avoid an information bottleneck, so that people in the movement arent forced to run things by gatekeepers.
Since November, If Not Now has trained 100 people in their strategies and core values; they are aiming to train 1,000 people by the end of year. Thats a good-size group to test out Liberation.Networks capabilities and limitations.
Liberation.Network is meant to become If Not Nows primary online home and internal communication structure, although the group launched a placeholder website in late February that will be up at least until their page on Liberation.Network is live, if not longer.
Mayer admitted to Civicist that she is still unsure of the technical ins and outs of Liberation.Network. If Not Nows participation seems largely a result of their connection to Movement Netlab through Shapiro, and their willingness to get on board with the platform a sign of their trust in her and her work.
Cosecha, on the other hand, does not have a direct connection to Movement Netlab, but they do share similar organizing values and practices. Carlos Saavedra, a core organizer with Cosecha, helped start the movement, building on the youth organizing he did as a co-founder of the United We Dream Network, which was instrumental in getting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy implemented in 2012. Saavedra only met members of Movement Netlab in January 2015, when several of them attended a training run by Saavedra as part of his work at the Ayni Institute, a training organization for low-income community organizers.
One of the most appealing things about the Liberation.Network, Saavedra told Civicist, is that the people building it also come from a community organizing and mass movement tradition; they understand, he said, what the tools they are building are for.
A lot of people, even if they do the peer-to-peer software development, [their products are] not made for organizers, Saavedra said. Its made for technologists.
How do we develop a tool that is for people, by the people, with organizing in it. Thats whats really exciting about Movement Netlab, he added. Thats why, for us, its a big commitment to try to commit to this, but we feel like we have to.
Saavedras biggest concern, and the root of Cosechas internal debates over platforms and tools, is that this online platform will somehow alter their existing networka couple hundred leaders with a core leadership of 8  12. Because computer and/or internet access is a factor within Cosecha membership, Saavedra worries that the platform could be redundant, ignored in favor of platforms that are easier to access on phones (like Facebook), or, worse, create a division between online and offline organizing.
Still, Saavedra and the other core members of Cocecha believe that it is worth trying on principle: to practice the decentralized organizing online that they practice offline.
Taking the high road, with all its bumps
What Liberation.Network does not and will never have over platforms like Facebook and Twitter is ease-of-use or convenience. It will take either faith in the people building it or a commitment to shared ideals to get groups to sign on, at least at first, and even that might not be enough. To take ownership of a social-network-like platform is to have to pay for it, first of all. The current numbers Tammy Shapiro quoted to Civicist, which she says are subject to change as they move forward, are $1,000 for set up and $600 a year for hosting and security.
These numbers will go up for networks as they grow and require larger files and more files, but will also go down as we onboard more networks and can spread costs around, she informed Civicist.
The cost of joining Liberation.Network could be a barrier to entry for some movement groups, which are often short on funds and other resources. For groups that can afford it, it might be worth it to them to get off of commercial platforms (as much as is possible), whether because they dont want to worry about having their pages taken down or because they want to have more control over their own data.
People use Dropbox and Google...because its there and available, Dana Skallman, a technologist with Glocal, told Civicist. Were trying...to deploy an appa series of appsthat can provide similar tools that are free and open source.
The downside to open-source tools is that activists may be less familiar with how they work and will either have to be trained or to figure it out as they go. For movements made up of the young and tech-savvy, this might not be a problem, but not all movements are so homogenous.
And Movement Netlab and Glocal are learning as they go, as well. Well use what we have in this moment, Tammy Shapiro told Civicist, and then through the experience figure out whats missing.

With recent governmental tech disasters in mind and a parade of tech-driven policy horribles upon us, he argues, If democratically elected governments are going to be able to meet their citizens desires to limit and control the activities of digital companies, then a new class of public servants are going to have to be trained up to do that work.

In the aptly named Shoveling for Civic Tech Gold, Mark Headd explores the challenges that render segments of the civic tech community virtually powerless to have real impact. In particular, he speaks about innovative and noble-minded projects ultimately failing because they find no support from the very governments they aim to help. His observations align well with what I have seen during my time in government, participating on the fringes of the movement for many years now.
Why dont governments support interesting civic tech projects? There are many smart people within government who truly want to make a difference and would be happy to support any viable option that came forward. However, they too are frequently frustrated by a excessive number of reasons to say no, and nearly all of them highlight the underlying issueits risky. Both the policy-making and thing-doing wings of government arent well-suited to take risks. Politicians get repeatedly and publicly torn apart when failure happens. All levels of government employees are subject to processes that inherently reduce the risk of failure and corruption, while simultaneously stifling innovation. There are no shortage of attempts to build new models that can tolerate risk, but few are sanctioned to shortcut or entirely skip the bureaucracy. If anything, they become experts in how to follow the rules so they know exactly where the loopholes are.
Perhaps, then, by resurfacing some of the specific risks and concerns about civic tech projects, we can eventually find a better path towards partnerships.

When something goes wrong, who is going to fix it? Code breaks, servers and network connections fail, cloud computing bills dont get paid, and architectures collapse under stress. If a government is going to publicly support a specific solution, everyone involved wants to make sure it works, and will continue to work for as long as needed.
Who will support the customers? New solutions, particularly small innovative ones, dont have teams behind them which can effectively handle and track the inevitable questions, no matter how intuitive the design of the interface.
How long will the product/solution be around? The greatest tech solutions crafted by the worlds finest development teams arent sustainable if they built it over a few weekends in their proverbial garages in between their day jobs, families, and social lives. This is why hackathons are largely considered community-building practices, not solutions.
If the solution captures data, who does the data belong to, who has access to it, and how will it be used? Plenty of freemium services trade access to data in exchange for providing free capabilities. How will a new solution use the data it collects, and what might the unintended consequences be?
If the data is sensitive and gets stolen, who is liable? If the government has encouraged people to use a third-party tool, that same public will still hold the government accountable. That risk cant be transferred to a group of civic hackers.

All of the above considerations get managed by formal agreementoften a procurement, but sometimes a memorandum of understanding can be substituted. That takes lawyers civic tech teams dont generally have, and time from the army of lawyers that the government already has who are overwhelmed by other firefights. The agreements define rights, responsibilities, and liabilities on both sideseven if no money changes hands.
Once the possibility of a formal agreement comes into the picture, another major factor comes into play: fairness.
We can argue about its effectiveness some other time, but government procurement is generally designed to ensure fairness and ethical behavior, and those notions are deeply rooted in policies and practices. Even if the solution will be of no cost, those tenets of fairness and ethics will come into play. How can anyone be sure that the solution to be used is the best one, or even the only one? Is it possible that someone else will file a lawsuit because they didnt have a chance to offer their own solution? Suddenly there are more risks to mitigate.
And, flipping over the coin of fairness, what guarantee is there that a particular solution will be fair and accessible to every customer? An agreement enabling an online application process for SNAP benefits wont serve the full audience of eligible participants. Governments have to consider how each solution plays into the bigger picture, and fill gaps as they are recognized.
Reflecting back on this, a lot of the rationale here also explains why leveraging open source software can be a huge challenge for governmentsone which is unlikely to be resolved without reframing risks or procurement. Until the civic tech movement can effectively grapple with these, its (unfortunately) likely to continue in a position on the sidelines.

For the first fully attended Filipino presidential debate in more than two decades, the GMA Network, which moderated the Feb. 21 debate along with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, did not hold back.
 The 360-degree livestreaming on the GMA website allowed web users to pan the omnidirectional camera around the venue in near-real-time as they watched the debate (go behind the scenes in this short YouTube video.) The main debate page, Eleksyon 2016, which housed the livestream (along with multiple social media stats), had more than 1 million views.  

 The first debate was a success by other, possibly more meaningful measures of engagement as well. TV ratings were huge and even bigger on Mindanao island where the debate was being held. The #PiliPinasDebates2016 hashtag was trending on Twitter inside and outside the country.
 The Rappler news site did a nice job of summarizing and providing highlights from the debate. It also provided an interactive community page that maintained active commentary and conversation during and after the debate.
 Despite all this engagement, the debate, in both format and contentas well as levels of accesswas not without controversy. It was held at Capitol University in Cagayan de Oro City on Mindanao, the second largest and southern-most island in the Filipino archipelago. While the moderatorsall journalists from major news outlets in Manilawere prepared to address local issues in the debate, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) initially limited local journalists to only five seats at the venue. After threats of a boycott from the local press club and at least one of the candidates, the number of seats increased to 25.
 Comelec was already being sued by Rappler for the way it granted exclusive broadcast rights to the nations largest television companies and partners of its choosing. The national moderators also admitted that candidates knew the debate topics ahead of the debate, although not the questions. 
 As far as the debate itself, many viewers thought the 48 minutes of commercials during the 135-minute broadcast was a bit much, and the candidates had difficulty getting beyond soundbites because of the strictly enforced 90-second limit on responses. Two more presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate are scheduled in the coming months.
IN OTHER DEBATE NEWS ...

 No Debates, Big Loss in Jamaica: The strategy of a seemingly entrenched incumbent candidate refusing to debate a rival, opposition candidate backfired big-time on Thursday, as the Jamaica Labour Party upset the ruling Peoples National Party in the countrys general elections.
 The national debates were canceled after the PNP refused to participate over grievances with Labour Party Leader Andrew Holness.
 Writing at Global Voices, Emma Lewis has a terrific round-up of last-minute proposals for political dialogue and dashed hopes. (Her earlier round-up of reactions to the PNPs decision not to participate in national debates is equally good.)
In one instance, RJR Communications Group, which owns a number of media outlets, proposed a news forum, with each party interviewed separately. But as Lewis notes, two RJR journalistsDionne Jackson Miller, head of the Press Association of Jamaica, and radio talk show host Emily Shields, both panelists for previous televised debatesrefused to participate on principle.

Earlier this month, Noel daCosta, chairman of Jamaica Debates Commission, shared survey information the Commission had gathered to assess the impact of national debates in 2007 and 2011. Among the findings:

More than three-quarters of respondents (78 percent) who followed the debates felt the debates addressed issues that were important to them. 
Approximately 70 percent said the national debates helped them to clarify the position of each party on critical issues, with 32 percent of respondents saying the debates definitely helped, and 38 percent saying the debates helped somewhat.  
About 30 percent of those who followed the debates said that they were more likely to change the way they would vote as a result of the debates.

The findings from this study clearly indicate that voters pay attention to the national debates and, for many, the debates do help them to make decisions about how they will vote, daCosta wrote. 
To the Polls in Ireland: The last of three debates with the party leaders in Ireland concluded on Wednesday in anticipation of todays general election. Adoreboard, a semantic analytics firm at Queens University, declared Labour Leader Joan Burton the winner.
 Adoreboards emotion platform, Toneapi.com, managed to show that more than 57 percent of the interactions with Ms. Burton on the site were positive, reported The Irish Times. Facebook had sponsored an earlier debate.
 Baby Steps Toward Debate Culture: Although President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda won a fifth term in office, promising to extend his now 30-year reign (classified as dictatorship light by analysts, notes The New York Times), democratic forces can claim a minor victory with the first-ever presidential debate attended by all the candidates. 
 Crispy Kaheru, a coordinator for the Citizens Coalition for Electoral Democracy Uganda (CCEDU), spoke optimistically to Voice of America: Uganda is one of those countries where the culture of debate is not deeply entrenched. And seeing us making baby steps in that direction is very much encouraging. And beyond a debate of this nature, I think it lays a foundation for dialogue processes to happen post the election, which is important for this country.

Lets start with a provocation:
The worlds national, state and local governments dont have the right digital skills in the right quantities to meet the challenges of the coming century. This is a Big Problem.
Im calling this a provocation rather than a statement of fact because, despite looking, I cant really find anything approaching reliable data on the quantity or quality of digital skills spread across governments. Read into that data gap what you will.
If you dont share my suspicion that governments are understaffed to cope with the digital age, then you can stop reading now.  Im sure theres some other explanation as to why Healthcare.gov blew up and brought Obamas approval ratings to an all time low, and why Hillary Clintons chance of being President of the Goddamn USA is most seriously threatened because of a Goddamn email server. And Im sure that with a wide public-sector track record of cocking up relatively simple digital projects that theres virtually no chance of something truly catastrophic happening the first time governments try to seriously regulate genuinely difficult digital things like Facebooks wall algorithm, or self-driving cars ethical logic.
However, if you do share my theory that theres a seriously problematic skills gap when it comes to governments and digital technology, do please read on. The rest of this post is about things we can do together to make sure our governments get the skills they need.
We need a public technology hippocratic oath
Ubiquitous sensors and oceans of data produce a range of ethical dilemmas that will trouble politicians and public servants for the foreseeable future.
It simply isnt reasonable to ask harried public service workers, or even harried politicians, to discuss, from first principles, the fathomless moral conundrums related to data and technology every time a new digital service is set up or modified. People need moral frameworks to lean againstalways have, always will.
Consequently, a new set of techno-ethical principles need codifying that are easy to remember, easy to teach, easy to hold people accountable against, just as the principles are that are taught to doctors or soldiers alike. They need to be the sorts of things that are drilled into the heads of students, sworn on during appointment ceremonies, and stuck on the back of office toilet doors for reinforcement later in life.
This authoring process is going to mean an intellectual battle royale of digital thinkers and digital principles. I consider preparing and defending such sets of principles a practical challenge for the likes of Zeynep Tufecki, Evgeny Morozov, Tim OReilly, Mustafa Suleyman, the new center for Data & Society, and pretty much all of the worlds academic moral philosophers. And when its all over, its highly likely that no single idea or set of principles will have won. But at least therell be a range to choose from, and some frameworks for people to fall back on, rather than none.
We need universities to establish new centers for research on and teaching of public technology
In the MOOC era its almost embarrassing to be a professional technologist talking about the need for academic teaching that takes years and is situated largely in one building. But Im going to take one on the chin for bricks, mortar, and non-pixelated academics.
The reason we need to talk about new academic centers and new academic teams as serious, physical ventures, is that the amount of work that needs doing in the new public technology sector is just enormous. We need to produce and stress-test lots of new ideas, we need to produce lots of new people, we need to produce lots of new data and research.
Theres just much too much work to be done than can be managed by slotting into the cracks within an existing research center or an existing masters program. There was no way that all of nuclear physics research could be squeezed inside the spare rooms of old 19th century physics faculty buildings, and the same will be true of public technology. The issue is too big, and the amount of outputs required are just too great.
[UPDATE:] The good news is that there are already promising signs of movement. The GovLab at NYU doesnt just publish papers but has been actively coaching public servants to push through a huge number of new digital government projectsthey claim an impressive 250 in the last year. Elsewhere in the same university CUSP is focusing on data at the city level, especially how it is acquired and exploited to help cities become more productive, livable, equitable and resilient. It has codified knowledge into an actual masters programthe MsC in Applied Urban Science and Informatics that points the way towards how more formally recognized graduates can emerge from this field. And the action is not just reserved to New Yorkin Princeton the Center for Information Technology Policy works less on city-level delivery projects and more on the ever-growing world of pure policy questions that the internet seems to generate every day. Berkman and the MIT Media Lab have touched on this field for years. And the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins is going great guns too.
What I hope is that the people running universities (and the people funding universities) become ever more sympathetic towards the claim that there is a significant public interest in working on public technology ideas and skills. A start has been made, but the number of actual certified courses that wannabe public technologists or general public servants could join today is relatively few, and the range of formally recognized qualifications relatively modest.
The rest of this piece essentially sketches out various programs of work that could be tackled by this sort of new centre for public technology, and for similar but non-degree-granting institutions such as think tanks, companies and dedicated public-interest NGOs like Code for America. Geoff Mulgan recently mooted the idea of a machine intelligence commission; this idea represents exactly the sort of non-university institution that will also have a part to play in fleshing out the whole public technology space.
We need a lot of new thinking about what good public technology looks like
Before we can get really good at teaching a lot of people to be public technologists, we need to develop a lot of new ideas about what good public technology actually looks like. The Government Digital Service and 18F have already started strongly on this front, but their relatively modest size, age, and remit means theyve only just started to scratch the surface of all the thinking that needs doing.
Ultimately good thinking needs to emerge on issues varying from ethical ideas (see above), to procedural ideas (how do we get more user-centered design into governments?), to very difficult and very technical ideas (how does a government audit private-sector machine learning algorithms for unintentional-but-emergent sexism?).
This is going to need quite a lot of people given quite a lot of space and time to look into very different issues. Public sector procurement reform couldnt possibly be more different to auditing the ethics coded into self-driving vehicles, but both will need serious brainpower if our governments are going to serve their citizens effectively. This is going to need a lot of new people, a lot of coffee, a lot of conferences, a lot of papers, a lot of real world experiments, and a lot of publications. Public Technology as an issue is so big that it represents a whole new school, connected with and dependent upon many other schools, but separate and sizeable in the same way that medicine and the law are separate from general schools of government.
The ideas are, of course, only important if they make it into government, which is what the next section focuses on.
We need to train up a lot of specifically public technologists
All of the ideas generated through the above intellectual ferment will remain firmly excluded from government itself if we dont create a whole new generation of public technologists who can infiltrate the governments of the world and bring change from the inside. These individuals will have to have extremely strong, Silicon Valley-grade technical skills, but also a better-than-basic grounding in the history and operation of the state, the legal system, and the quirks of democratic structures. Together they can get stuck into the problem that, in rich countries, cities alone deliver hundreds of services each, almost none of which have been transformed in the way that so many private sector services have been. There is a giant backlog of work simply to make the public sector even resemble the private one, in terms of user experience and efficiency.
We need these people for many reasons, though, only of which only the most basic is making sure government websites work OK. A need every bit as vital as running the governments own systems is going to be the problem of regulating digital systems run by other people.
If democratically elected governments are going to be able to meet their citizens desires to limit and control the activities of digital companies, then a new class of public servants are going to have to be trained up to do that work. And because even one algorithm inside one internet giant is so unfathomably complicated and so unfathomably wrapped up in legal protections, were going to need really quite a lot of these people.
There is currently an entire missing generation of BAs, MAs, and PhDs who are not entering the public service at all, let alone with the right skills. But widespread public demands for both better government services and more control over digital companies are going to make these skills shortfalls less and less tolerable. Ultimately its going to be the universities that will be the key actors in reacting, followed by professional training organizations. And a lot of care will have to be taken to make sure that this training doesnt replicate in government the gender and ethnic inequalities that plague the technology sector.
We need to influence the university and professional training of mainstream politicians and public servants
If the decision makers of 2050 have a new cadre of public technologists below them, but have zero understanding of digital issues themselves, the problems of digitally ignorant governments will not go away.
Digital technology issues are different from some of the more familiar techno-political challenges of the 20th century. As a political leader you dont have to understand nuclear physics to understand what mutually assured destruction means for your foreign policy. As a health minister you dont have to know much about the interactions of drugs with cells to know that a pill of cost X that stops Y people from needing costly medical treatment Z is worth it.
But digital technologies represent a change to the fundamentals of government, society and economy thats more analogous to the rise of economics than the rise medicine. A lack of digital skills will ruin a governors ability to do their job, in the way that a lack of medical knowledge wont. After all, if a big chunk of your money supply is running on some sort of blockchain-based system, can you make good fiscal policy if you have not even the faintest idea what that means? And if your civil servants tell you that its time to replace some manual public services with similar services partly powered by a new form of AI, how can you be a good leader if you dont know what sorts of questions you should ask? And what if people start passing laws that are themselves in some sense algorithmicwill you be able to vet the bill?
So, as well as creating a new generation of public technologists with deep technical skills, we also need to create a new generation of mainstream public servants and politicians who have a similar amount of technology knowledge as they have in more common areas like political philosophy, history, or economics.
To be clear, these will not be political and public service leaders who can code entire applications or hack into the computers of foreign governments (although that would make for a fun diplomatic crisis). They will instead be public service leaders who are equipped with a mental toolbox of computing concepts and key questions to ask, as well as strong familiarity with the ethical principles discussed above. They wont be computing experts, but they will be literate of key computing concepts.
This development will require widespread collaboration between the new centers of public technology expertise and the pre-existing university departments of political science, social science, literature, history and business that supply so many of the worlds public servants and politicians. There will definitely be tricky moments, especially the part where the news is broken that some older skills probably have to be dropped to make room for the new: I was taught metaphysics, for example, in my own degree-for-political-leaders.
We need more data on how many public technologists are needed, and for what purposes
We need a lot more data about the scale of need for public technology skills, the scale of production of those skills, and their impacts once they are delivered.
As I stated at the top of this piece, I cant myself provide quantified evidence on the need for public technologists, in the way that I could for well-documented teacher or doctor shortfalls in many countries. Those of you still reading probably agree that a shortfall exists, but you probably cant quantify it either.
That degree of shared suspicion is more than enough justification to spend some initial money on getting started, but it isnt enough to see training and research reach a really large scale. Evidence will need gathering on both need and effectiveness of public technology teaching before public technology becomes a skill set that is more than niche and experimental.
New university centers are ideally positioned to work with concerned governments to map the scale of the problem, and thus map the scale of response needed. Does the U.S. need two Masters programs producing pubic technologists, or two hundred? This is a question that can be answered, but only through diligent work and close collaboration.
What next?
This piece is not supposed to be a bombshell dropped on an unsuspecting world. I am writing it because it is a consolidation of things I have heard a great many people say, as well as my own ideas and, of course, prejudices. But writing it down under one heading I hope to provoke people who see something in this to come forward. Citizens of the 21st century need public technologists like citizens of the 19th century needed municipal engineers to build the drains and clean water supplies.
As societies, weve done this once before. Its time to talk about whether we can live up to our own ancestors.

What sharing economy? Remember Tom Slee and Murray Coxs investigative report that raised questions about Airbnbs host listing data in New York City? The company has now admitted, in a letter to New York lawmakers, many of whom have been critical of the companys practices, that it removed selected listings from its sites before a carefully controlled data release back in December, as Kristen Brown reports for Fusion. Thus it has essentially confirming Slee and Coxs core allegation, that it had cooked its books to reduce the number of multiple listings on the site. Airbnb now says it will keep removing hosts with multiple unit listings from its NYC site. More than one-third of host revenue still comes from such sharelords.


Theres a lesson here for journalists covering the sharing economy: sometimes the story is hidden in plain view, but you have to track company usage data over time or youll never see it. Slee and Cox had been scraping Airbnb public data for months, which is how they were able to spot the companys own scrubbing of its listings in advance of its transparency push.

Case Study: The Reactor, an audience-response tool often referred to as the worm  Country: New Zealand Debate: TV3 Party Leaders Debate, Nov. 21, 2011

On the evening of Nov. 21, 2011, New Zealanders tuned in to watch the leaders of the two major parties face off for one of the final debates before the general election. At one podium stood the incumbent, John Key, leader of the center-right National Party. At the other stood his challenger Phil Goff, leader of the center-left Labour Party. Between them was the journalist John Campbell, who posed questions to the candidates and refereed their responses. And along the bottom of the screen, reflecting viewers reactions to the debate, was the worm.
Viewers downloaded an audience-response app onto their smartphones that offered a slider placed along a spectrum from 0 to 100. If they liked what the candidate on their TV screen was saying, they dragged the slider closer to 100. If they didnt, they dragged the slider closer to 0. These responses would then be transmitted to Roy Morgan Research, the Australian market research firm that developed the technology, and aggregated to draw the Reactor (commonly referred to as the worm): a line that crawled along the bottom of the broadcast. If most viewers were reacting positively, it went up. If most viewers were reacting negatively, it went down.
The idea of gauging voters gut reactions and representing them as a moving line had been around for years. First used in Australia in 1993, the worm has since shown up in British and U.S. debates as well. But all previous uses, in New Zealand and elsewhere, had relied exclusively on a studio audience: A small sample of undecided voters watched the debate together and keyed their reactions into hand-held devices. What distinguished the 2011 debate was anyone with a smartphone or tablet could join in.
 A History of Influence and Inconsistency
This innovation offered far greater potential for audience participationbut it also brought new risks. No sooner had the plan been announced than critics attacked it. Their first concern was its vulnerability to manipulation. One advantage of using a smaller sample was control: Debate producers could select voters who at least claimed to be uncommitted, and thus more likely to react with an open mind. A smartphone audience, on the other hand, might include many partisans who only gave their candidate high marks.
The other issue raised by critics was access. In 2011, only about 5 percent of New Zealanders owned smartphones. And, as one left-wing blogger pointed out, these tended to be wealthier citizens, who largely voted for the center-right National Party rather than the center-left Labour Party.
Aside from these smartphone-specific concerns, there were more general criticisms of the worm itself. Ever since it first started slithering across the countrys TV screens in 1996, New Zealanders have been arguing about whether it helps or hurts their democracy. The worms defenders claim it offers a useful measure of voter sentiment, and a refreshing counterpoint to the pundits and politicians who usually dominate the airwaves around election time. Its critics argue that it represents, at best, a trivial distraction, and at worst, a damaging distortion of the democratic process.

Waikato University political scientist Ron Smith blamed it for rewarding worm whisperer politicos who prefer displays of emotion and crowd-pleasing platitudes to serious policy discussion. In 2005, the High Court of New Zealand issued an opinion stating that the worm may undermine the objectivity of election coverage.
Those fears are not limited to New Zealand. In Australia, analysts have found it tends to tip in favor of progressive politicians and in response to positive language. Tell an inspirational story, and the worm will respond favorably. Go negative or use sarcasm, and youre less likely to be rewarded. 
If you say this is the greatest city or country in the world, the worm goes through the roof. If you say well, the problem weve got is our hospitals dont work, it goes down. But weve found it unerringly accurate over the 20 years weve done it, Ray Martin, a newsman who moderated debates in Australia for Channel Nine News, told the BBC. 
In 2007, Australias prime minister agreed to a televised debate with his Labour Party opponent only if none of the three networks covering the debate used the worm. Channel Nine News did anyway and had its live feed cut, sparking cries of political censorship.
While some researchers have argued that real-time measurement is a source of raw data, others have shown that the worm may impede viewers ability to form their own judgments. Three British researchers reported on an experiment with 150 university students in which they manipulated the worm and superimposed it on a live broadcast of the final of three UK election debates in 2010. They found that the manipulation influenced viewers judgments not only of who had won the debate, but their choice of preferred prime minister.
Apart from the concerns about unintentional bias, there is real possibility that the worm could be used to systematically bias the outcome of the election, said Jeffrey Bowers, a psychology professor at the University of Bristol who was involved with the study. Given the small sample of undecided voters that generate the worm, just one or two persons could influence the worm by voting for one candidate no matter what. The system is cute, but open to abuse.

[Above: Studio audience responses during the first of three leaders debates in the 2010 UK general election.]
In 2013, the British Parliaments Select Committee on Communications held hearings on televised political debates and invited another of the studys authors, Colin Davis, also a psychology professor at University of Bristol, to testify. Even without any deliberate bias, its very unlikely that the worm provides an accurate indication of the views of undecided voters, given that it is based on such a small sample, said Davis, referring to the less than two dozen people selected to use the worm during debates hosted by ITV News and the BBC in 2010. (Responses were shown during post-debate analysis, not during the live debate.)
Also testifying was Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University and author of Presidential Debates: 50 Years of High-Risk TV. I think [the worm] is ridiculous, he told the committee. First of all, I think social media, particularly Twitter, has supplanted the worm. The real-time, real reaction of the audience is now measurable in ways that make the worm obsolete.
[Another group of British researchers who see the limitations of the wormand also Twitterhave created a debate response app that aims to provide more insight into voters attitudes. See the previous story in the Rethinking Debate series: Making the UKs Political Debates More Responsive to Public Needs.]
But can the worm actually sway an election? The record in New Zealand is inconclusive. When the worm debuted in 1996, it spurned incumbent Prime Minister Jim Bolger and favored his challenger, Labour leader Helen Clark. Clark enjoyed a subsequent boost in the polls, while Bolger went ballistic, threatening to boycott any future debates that included the worm. Some days the worm will eat you, some days youll eat the worm, joked the Waikato Times.
 The worm remained for the other debates, over Bolgers objections. But it didnt change the result: Bolgers party won.
Yet in 2002, the worm was widely credited with catapulting a little-known politician into power. During a televised debate among the leaders of minor parties, a centrist named Peter Dunne sent the worm soaring by repeating popular phrases like common sense and family. In the aftermath, Dunne became a media sensation: The man for whom the worm turned up trumps, declared the New Zealand Herald. And when New Zealand went to the polls 12 days later, Dunnes party had its best-ever showing, picking up eight seats in Parliament.
Did Dunne deserve his rapid ascent from minor politician to potential kingmaker? It depends on whether you believed that Dunne was a manipulative worm whisperer, or whether he spoke to a genuine need in the electorate not represented by mainstream politicians. In any case, his rise only fanned the flames of controversy around the worms role in New Zealand politics.
 Studio vs. Smartphone Worms
Given this highly charged history, when New Zealand became the first country to open up the worm to smartphones in 2011, the debates producers were cautious. One might expect them to play up this innovations world premiere. Instead, they consistently downplayed itno doubt in response to concerns about its accuracy and fairness, and the worms polarizing legacy in New Zealand politics.
Reactor app screenshots on Google Play
There were in fact two worms in action during the debate. The first was the old-fashioned handset kind, controlled by the TV3 studio audience. These were 65 uncommitted voters: a truly representative sample of New Zealand in terms of their age, gender, and ethnicity, debate moderator John Campbell explained in his opening remarks. The second worm would be driven by viewers at home on their smartphones.
While there will be people reacting with open minds to what each leader is saying, there will also be party supporters wildly responding to whos on screen at the time, said Campbell.
Campbell urged people to pay closer attention to the former. The second worm is not scientific, he warned. It is simply a chance to have your say.
The CEO of Roy Morgan Research, Michele Levine, echoed this message in an interview the day after the debate. The studio audience is supposed to be the important one, she said.
These carefully worded caveats suggested the smartphone-driven worm would be highly volatile, while the studio audience worm would offer a more measured response. In fact, the opposite was true. During the hour-long debate, the app worm remained relatively calm, staying close to the horizontal axis marked Neutral. 
It had moments of responsiveness: ticking downwards when National leader John Key discussed his plans to privatize public assets, for instance, and upwards when Labour leader Phil Goff argued those assets should remain state-owned. But overall, the app Worm was far less excitable than the studio audience worm, which cut sharp peaks and valleys across the bottom of the screen all night.
Not only was the studio worm more reactive than the app worm, it was also considerably more one-sided. The app worm didnt seem noticeably partisan, and it certainly didnt reflect a National bias, as some Labour observers had feared. By contrast, the studio audience heavily favored Goff over Key. The Labour leader repeatedly drove the studio worm to the top of the graph, while Key put it into a tailspin.
Despite the moderators insistence that none of us here at the studio will know what the worms are saying, it seems likely that Goff, the underdog in the polls, hoped to reproduce Peter Dunnes 2002 success by emulating his worm whisperer ways. Goff repeatedly struck an emotional note by telling the stories of individual New Zealanders who had suffered as a result of the financial crisis. His empathetic style and his focus on economic justice resonated strongly with the studio audience, leading most observers to conclude that Goff won the debate.
In fact, the result was so lopsided that conservatives immediately cried foul. In the hours after the debate ended, right-wing blogger David Farrar produced evidence that four members of the studio audience were covert Labour and Green Party supporters, sparking a scandal that swirled through New Zealand media for days.
Whatever the sources of Goffs success, however, it didnt do much for him at the polls. After the debate, Labours numbers remained flat at about 27 percent, vs. Nationals 50 percent. And this proved to be a fairly good predictor of the final tally on election day: 27.48 percent for Labour and 47.31 percent for National.
It was ironic: After all the anxiety about the possibility of the app-driven worm being hijacked by partisans, it was the studio worm that triggered accusations of bias. This raised an interesting possibility: Perhaps the much-maligned at-home audience wasnt a mob of party fanatics, as nearly every pundit in New Zealand claimed they would be. Perhaps their reactions were more typical of the electorate as a whole than the 65 citizens who composed the studio audience.
After all, how representative is a group of voters who are still undecided five days before the election? Leaving aside questions of Labour infiltration, such voters may react very differently than most of the electorate. They also reflect a geographical bias. As Auckland market researcher Jonathan Dodd pointed out in The National Business Review, these panels draw their members from the city where the debate is held. Voters from Auckland, where the 2011 worm debate took place, may have a different set of concerns than voters in other parts of the country.
Another major advantage of the smartphone worm is sample size. The 2011 debate had 65 voters in the studio audience, but worms in other countries have used even fewer50 in the United Kingdom, and 30 in the United States. As science writer Simon Oxenham has observed, these absurdly tiny sample sizes provide a highly skewed picture of public opinion. Enabling audience participation through smartphones has the potential to make the worm a more accurate indicator of voter sentimentbut only if it engages a large, diverse, and geographically dispersed user base.
Will the Debate Worm Wiggle On?
Unfortunately, this didnt happen in New Zealand in 2011. Roy Morgan Research never reported the number of users who used the Reactor app during the debate, but the available evidence suggests its use that night was limited. More New Zealanders use Android smartphones than iPhones; on the Google Play store, the Reactor app shows 5,000 to 10,000 downloads, and that includes the last five years.
The countrys low rates of smartphone penetration certainly played a role, but so did widespread voter apathy. Voter turnout in 2011 was 74.21 percentthe countrys lowest since 1887. And even in an especially listless election season, the debate with the worm was the least-watched of the three major debates between Key and Goff: Only 276,000 New Zealanders tuned in, compared with around half a million for the others.
In 2011, New Zealand introduced an important innovation into the world of political debatesbut left its potential unfulfilled. And in the years since, no one has repeated the experiment. The most recent elections in New Zealand in 2014 were worm-free, and the worms other television appearances around the world, including the UK in 2015, have relied only on studio audiences.
Meanwhile, smartphone penetration has grown rapidly. Device costs have plummeted, while processing power and bandwidth have increased. The conditions for an app-driven worm are much better today than they were four years ago, both in New Zealand and elsewhere. Yet so far, no debate producer has taken it on.
Of course, old concerns remain. A smartphone worm can enlarge the sample size and make it more representative of the electorate. But it does little to quiet critics fears that real-time audience feedback undermines the quality of the debate by pressuring candidates to play for the worm with pandering rhetoric. Several thousand people are likely to be just as susceptible to worm whisperers as a few dozen.
Neither will a smartphone worm provide a better prediction of voter preferences on election day. Just because a worm likes a candidate doesnt mean he or she will win. Real-time reactions dont necessarily translate into votes, as New Zealands recent history makes clear.

Snowy sidewalks in New York City (Photo: Michael Tapp)

Unshoveled sidewalks during the winter months are a persistent problem for cities in the snow belt.
For places with significant snowfall, unshoveled sidewalks pose a challenge to public safety and mobility for those that rely on walking (or public transit), and present an especially acute problem for those that have physical impairments. Uncleared snowfall on other kinds of public infrastructure, like fire hydrants, also poses dangers for city residents and public safety workers.
This is a sometimes daunting issue for cities that government officials, community groups and civic technologists perennially struggle with. Over the past several years, a number of civic technology projects have been initiated with the goal of mitigating the problem of uncleared sidewalks and other public infrastructure in cities. Few have been widely adopted, and, if were being honest, the impact of these efforts on reducing the problems associated with uncleared snowfall has been minimal.
Certain aspects of the problem seems relatively straightforward, and would appear to be a pretty good fit for a properly designed civic app. But despite several different efforts, there is not yet a widely adopted civic tech solution that most people would agree has had a meaningful impact on the problem.
In many ways, unshoveled sidewalks help highlight both the potential and the limitations of civic technology.  For those that care about civic tech, this issue is worth understanding more fully.
Civic Tech for Snow Removal
One of the first civic apps developed by Code for America was Adopt-a-Hydrant for the City of Boston. The app created an easy way to volunteer to clear the area around a fire hydrant after a significant snowfall.
This app has since been deployed for other cities, and converted to support volunteers that want to help take care of other kinds of civic infrastructure like tsunami sirens, water inlets and sidewalks. In Chicago, the base Adopta app was repurposed and set up to allow volunteers to clear sidewalks after snow storms.
And though uncleared sidewalks are a persistent problem in the Windy City, the app saw little adoption and is now dormant.
While the group responsible for deploying Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago offered some criticisms of the app itself to help explain its low adoption rate, it should be noted that when it was originally developed this app was pretty groundbreaking. And the basic idea of an app to allow citizens to volunteer to help maintain and clear civic infrastructure, which Adopta pioneered, is one of the more potent and durable ideas in the world of civic tech.
But an easy solution to help mitigate the perennial problem of blocked sidewalks and covered hydrants continues to elude those of us in the world of civic tech. And its not for a lack of trying.
In addition to Chicagos Adopt-a-Sidewalk, there are a number of other civic tech projects that have attempted to this problem.
311 apps may let residents report snow removal issues, and 211 services may let residents in need of assistance find help if they need it. The civic tech company SeeClickFix operates a service call Snow Crew and at least two recent civic hacking events (one of which, full disclosure, I am a judge for) have seen sidewalk snow removal apps developed. There are even efforts to use traditional social media as a way to call attention to uncleared walkways.
As a community, those in civic tech appear to have acknowledged that this is an issue worth solving. And if nothing else, web and mobile technologies have been shown to be pretty damn good at connecting those in need with volunteers that have the time or resources to help. This should be a fixable problem, right?
And yet, every time the snow falls in non-trivial amounts in cities across the snow belt, the problems return.
The Curious Case of Snow Removal
In some ways, the problem of snow removal is unique in the context of allowing volunteers to help maintain civic infrastructure. As noted by the Smart Chicago Collaborative, which oversaw the deployment of Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago, the seasonality of the problem can make adoption difficult:
...the application is useless when there is no snow on the ground. Adopt-a-sidewalk is irrelevant in the summertime, and, for most of the winter spent between snow storms.

Further muddying the water for potential users, and unlike other kinds of public infrastructure, many cities in the snowbelt require property owners to clear the sidewalks adjacent to their property or potentially incur fines. More than for other types of Adopta app uses, there is the potential for allowing people to volunteer to take care of infrastructure that they are already legally responsible for clearing.
Some cities in the snowbelt, but not all, may also provide sidewalk clearance services by assessing a special fee on property owners, by clearing problem sidewalks and billing those not in compliance with local ordinances, or by helping marshal volunteers to help those in need.
But even in places where government is proactive about snow removal, the problems still exist. For example, the City of Rochester, New York, has a service for clearing sidewalks of snow, but it doesnt kick in until at least 4 inches of snow have fallen. In addition, scheduling considerations can potential delay sidewalk clearing in different parts of the city depending on the nature of a particular storm.
But even a city that provides a service for clearing sidewalks and has decades of experience with contemporary snow removal practices still regularly sees residents complain of being negatively impacted by uncleared walkways and other public infrastructure.
This is a problem that neither the civic tech community nor governments seem to be able to develop a comprehensive solution for on their own.
Toward Better Civic Cooperation
For some types of civic tech solutions, the absence of a strong government partner isnt a major issue. In fact, there are a number for which the very existence of an app can be tied to governments not being involved in a specific activity, or shirking their responsibility.
The Detroit Water Project was started to assist residents who had their water service discontinued by the City of Detroit because of an inability to make payments. It was actions taken by the city itself that created the problem being addressed by this civic app.
Grounded in Philly was started to help promote alternate uses for vacant property in Philadelphia, a persistent problem for which the city has been long been slow to respond.
Both are examples of civic projects that address an acute need not currently being met by city government. In some ways, this approach has advantages; working with governments to get them to adopt, endorse or even to advertise civic apps can be a challenge.
I once worked on a project at a hackathon in Philadelphia to develop an app for locating farmers markets and other outlets where fresh food could be purchased with SNAP benefits. The official list of these locations is maintained by the City of Philadelphia, and the app was embraced by local non-profits working to make food available to SNAP recipients. But when asked if the city would help advertise the availability of the app, at no cost to the city itself, officials refused. This kind of story all too common in civic tech.
To make a dent in the problem of unshoveled sidewalks and other public infrastructure, city officials and civic technologists are going to need to figure out a way to more effectively collaborate on solutions to the problem.
To be successful, civic apps will need to be accompanied by strong municipal policies (and enforcement of those policies) for unshoveled sidewalks and critical infrastructure. Civic apps can make up a part of the solution to this persistent problem, but probably not all of it. This may require working not only with executive branch agencies, but also with city council members.
Civic apps should probably be targeted to compliment existing municipal efforts where they exist. For example, in places like Rochester and Chicago, where some sidewalk snow removal assistance is already provided. Civic apps may also be valuable in helping raise awareness and ensure better compliance with existing municipal ordinances for clearing snow from sidewalks and fire hydrants.
Civic technologists can also help jurisdictions in the snow belt make better decisions on how to allocate limited snow removal resources. There is an abundance of data that can be used to better direct sidewalk snow clearing efforts like 311 data, locational data for schools, nursing homes, day care centers, bus stops and even data on vehicle registrations that can help identify elderly or handicapped individuals who may need more targeted assistance.
This is an opportunity to not only help address a problem that is common in many cities in this country (and that disproportionately falls on those with fewer resources, a dependency on public transit and that are elderly or disabled), but also to expand our knowledge on how civic tech projects can become more collaborative with government partners.
If we can identify an approach that works, there is the real potential to gain valuable knowledge that can assist all kinds of civic tech projects.
We havent figured out yet how civic tech can mitigate the problem of uncleared sidewalks. But when we do, the potential payoff could be bigger than a snow pile in February.

Gale Brewer addresses CUNY Tech Meetup. (Photo: Noel Hidalgo)

Dawn Barberco-founder of NY Tech Meetup, the largest Meetup group in the world, angel investor in early-stage startups like PhilanTech, and Civic Hall memberhas a new side project: CUNY Tech Meetup. CUNY, or the City University of New York, is the third-largest university system in the country, after the New York and California state systems, and has one of the most diverse student bodies in the U.S. In December, our Microsoft Technology & Civic Engagement team hosted CUNY Tech Meetup at Microsofts New York headquarters to introduce students to the pioneering civic tech work being done by Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, Noel Hidalgo of BetaNYC, Jeanne Brooks of DataKind, Noelle Francois of Heat Seek, Andrew Hoppin of NuCivic, Deanna Zandt of Lux Digital, and David Moore of Councilmatic. I interviewed Dawn about how CUNY Tech Meetup seeks to connect New Yorks thriving tech community and the citys public college system.
[Ed. note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. And, full disclosure, Civic Hall co-founder Andrew Rasiej is chairman of the NY Tech Meetup board.]
Matt Stempeck: You already founded this huge meetup, NY Tech Meetupwhy a spin-off? Why is it important to cultivate the tech community at CUNY specifically?
Dawn Barber: I like to think of the New York tech community as generous folks. We want to nurture our community and we want to give back to younger people. I felt that we already had a pretty good relationship with NYU and Columbia students, through different programs, and that CUNY students werent on the map in the same way, or integrated into our tech community in that same way.
It was my friend Art Chang at Tipping Point Partners who asked me to come and speak to this small group of students. He started a program called CUNY Tech Apprenticeship Program, and he was the one who came up with the idea and told the folks at CUNY they should have a tech meetup.
CUNY is kind of all over the place in the city: Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, uptown, downtown. I think its hard for them even to communicate to all the students in a cohesive way. Its a big population. I thought, well, I can take a lot of what Ive learned from NY Tech Meetup and apply that. The meetup can be for CUNY students, CUNY faculty, CUNY staff, and I want to bring  our industry friends to these meetups to interact with the students, so that hopefully those students will be part of the workforce of New York tech companies in the future. I dont want it to be only NYU and Columbia kids. These are our city kids, and often more immigrant kids who might not have the money to do internships where they dont get paid, or something like that. And so its meaningful to them, to hear from some of our folks and to have the opportunity to network.
I mean, youre the one who approached me about CUNY Tech Meetup. Thats so awesome, to have someone at a place like Microsoft come to me and say, this looks like its really important for New York and Id love to help out, maybe we can sponsor something.
MS: I think part of getting an awesome job in the tech industry is first being aware that these jobs exist, especially the ones in civic tech that are sort of social impact plus techyou might not even know its a thing that you can get paid for. And then also having the access and connections.
DB: Thats exactly right, and we ask our speakers to stick around after so students have the opportunity to start a conversation with them. Its important for CUNY to have a networking component.
MS: I understand youre a believer in taking the scenic route in life, and I really appreciate that. How do you translate that open-stance approach to college students who are often really concerned about finding a job out of college?
DB: Tech is new. Its not like finance or some of these other industries where theres a very specific route to go. Were all over the place. Theres no road map really. Mark Zuckerbergs doing one thing and Sheryl Sandbergs doing something else, and our New York companies have taken a whole range of paths to get to where they are. And I think its wide open.
MS: I think whether or not someone feels the agency to go and build something is huge, especially when we get to the world of civic tech where many of us are trying to build these platforms for democracy or to change cities, and are often affecting other peoples lives in doing so. I think its incredibly important that everybody feel invited to help redesign society, if thats what were doing. It cant just be a select few of us with tech skills and connections. Everybody needs to feel like they can contribute to that process.
DB: I think thats absolutely right. Thats what we should be using technology forto make the world better. Its not easy, and it doesnt always work. Thats a whole other component of tech, the failure part of it. I dont even like to use the word failure, its really the iteration process. We have to keep trying stuff, particularly when it relates to civic tech. It is not figured out yet at all. And we need to get more people involved who are trying. Thats all we can ask. You dont have to necessarily get it rightits great if you do, more power to youbut try.
MS: Thats what I love about CUNY Tech Meetup and why it was great having a roster of people in civic tech present in December, because we really do need more talent and future founders and everything else in the pipeline.
If people who dont currently have any interaction with the CUNY system want to contribute, what can they do?
DB: Come to CUNY Tech Meetup! Its free to join.
It is a little bit of a branding challenge that its called CUNY Tech Meetup, and it is for the CUNY community, but the mission is to integrate them into our larger tech community. I want tech community people like us to come, whether you want to speak or even to just come and network after with the students. If youre looking for developers, I want these students to be the CTOs of the future. Just come.
MS: Last question: Its a Leap Year so you have a full 24 extra hours. Whats the next meetup youre going to start?
DB: Ive always wanted to start a bulldogs meetup. Im a big bulldog lover.

First Post 





(Photo: By Jake Bucci - Bernie Sanders, CC BY 2.0)

I started writing about both parties becoming host bodies for 3rd party candidates. Instead of an essay, it turned into 50 tweets [reassembled here in essay form]. Here goes.
Social media is breaking the political Overton Windowthe ability of elites to determine the outside edges of acceptable conversation. The Overton Window was imagined as a limit on public opinion, but in politics, its the limit on what politicians will express in public.
Politically acceptable discourse is limited by supply, not demand. The public is hungry for more than politicians are willing to discuss. This is especially important in the U.S., because our two-party system creates ideologically unstable parties by design. In order to preserve inherently unstable coalitions, party elites and press had to put some issues into the Dont Mention X category. These limits were enforced by party discipline, and mass media whose economics meant political centrism was the best way to make money.
This was BC: Before Cable. One or two newspapers per town, three TV stations; all centrist, white, pro-business, respectful of authority.
Cable changed things, allowing outsiders to campaign more easily. In 92, Ross Perot, 3rd party candidate, campaigned through infomercials. That year, the GOPs Dont Mention X issue was the weakness of Reaganomics. Party orthodoxy said reducing tax rates would raise revenues. Perots ads attacked GOP management of the economy head on. He was the first candidate to purchase national attention at market rates. Post-Perot, cable became outside candidates tool for jailbreaking Dont Mention X: Buchanan on culture war, Nader on consumer protection.
After Cable but Before Web lasted only a dozen years. Cable added a new stream of media access. The web added a torrent. Whats special about After Webnowis that politicians talking about Dont mention X issues are doing so from inside the parties. This started with Howard Dean (the OG) in 03. Poverty was the mother of invention; Dean didnt have enough money to buy ads, even on cable. But his team had Meetup & blogs and their candidate believed something many voters did too, something actively Not Being Mentioned.
In 03, All Serious People (aka D.C. insiders) agreed the U.S. had to invade Iraq. Opposition to the war was not to be a campaign issue. Dean didnt care. In February of 2003, he said, If the war lasts more than a few weeks, the danger of humanitarian disaster is high.
Dean said, Iraq is a divided country, with Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish factions that share both bitter rivalries and large quantities of arms.
Dean said There is a very real danger that war in Iraq will fuel the fires of international terror.
For All Serious People, this was crazy talk. (Dean was, of course, completely correct.) This was also tonic to a passionate set of voters. Mentioning X became Deans hallmark. Far from marginalizing him, it got him tons of free news coverage. Trump is just biting those rhymes.
After webifying Perots media tactics, Dean pioneered online fundraising. Unfortunately for him, his Get Out The Vote operation didnt. That took Obama. Obama was less of an outsider than Dean (though still regarded as unelectable in 07) but used most of Deans playbook. Besides charisma, he had two advantages Dean didnt have. First, the anti-war position had gone from principled opposition to common sense. Obama could campaign not just on being prescient (as Dean also was) but on having been proved right years earlier.
The second advantage was that Obamas voter mobilization strategythe crown jewelswas superior to that of the Democratic Party itself. This was the last piece. Perot adopted non-centrist media, Dean distributed fundraising, Obama non-party voter mobilization. Social media is at the heart of all of this. Meetup and Myspace meant Dean and Obama didnt have to be billionaires to get a message out.
Online fundraising let outsiders raise funds, and it became a symbol of purity. Anyone not raising money at $25 a pop is now a plutocrat. And then there was vote-getting. Facebook and MyBarackObama let the Obama campaign run their own vote-getting machine out of Chicago.
McLuhan famously said The medium is the message. This is often regarded as inscrutably gnomic, but he explained it perfectly clearly. The personal and social consequences of any medium result from the new scale introduced into our affairs by any new technology. The new scale Facebook introduces into politics is this: all registered American voters, ~150M people, are now a medium-sized group. All voters used to be a big number. Now its less than 10 percent of Facebooks audience. A million users isnt cool. You know whats cool? A billion users.
Reaching and persuading even a fraction of the electorate used to be so daunting that only two national organizations could do it. Now dozens can. This set up the current catastrophe for the parties. They no longer control any essential resource, and can no longer censor wedge issues. Each party has an unmentionable Issue X that divide its voters. Each overestimated their ability to keep X out of the campaign.
Jeb(!) Bush, who advocates religious litmus tests for immigrants, has to attack Trumps anti-immigrant stance, because it went too far.
Clinton cant say Break out the pitchforks, because Democratic consensus says Weve done as much to banks as our donors will allow.
In 15, a 3rd party candidate challenging her on those issues from inside the party was inconceivable. (I dont think that word means...)
So here we are, with quasi-parlimentarianism. We now have four medium-sized and considerably more coherent voter blocs. Two rump establishment parties, Trump representing racist welfare state voters, and Sanders representing people who want a Nordic system. Trump is RINO, Sanders not even a Dem. That either one could become their partys nominee is amazing. Both would mark the end of an era.
We will know by March 15 whether a major partys apparatus can be hijacked by mere voters. (Last time it was: McGovern.) But the social media piece, and growing expertise around it, means that this is now a long-term challenge to our two-party system. Over-large party coalitions require discipline to prevent people from taking an impassioned 30 percent of the base in order to win the primaries. The old defense against this by the parties was You and what army? No third party has been anything other than a spoiler in a century.
The answer to that question this year, from both Trump and Sanders, is Me and this army I can mobilize without your help. Who needs a third party when the existing two parties have become powerless to stop insurgencies from within?

This is civic tech: And, in my humble opinion, a big deal too. ActBlue, the fundraising platform for Democratic and progressive political candidates that has processed nearly $1 billion in donations since its founding 11 years ago, is launching ActBlue Charities. As ActBlue Executive Director Erin Hill explains, charities of all sizes will be able to use the platform, getting immediate access to ActBlue 2.4 million-strong Express user base and benefiting from the companys hard-won experience optimizing its contributions interface. Notably, the nonprofit is staying progressive, as Hill writes, ActBlue Charities is open to any c3 organization that is willing to engage in grassroots fundraising, and whose activity doesnt contradict ActBlue Charities policies and values. Those values include (but arent limited to) social equality, womens rights, LGBTQ rights, racial justice, diversity, freedom of speech, and respect for scientific inquiry, discovery, and data.


Crisis Text Line has announced that it is opening its 13 million text message database to universities and other researchers, an unprecedented move that should enable smart system change on a broad scale, as its founder and CEO Nancy Lublin said in a press release. Aggregate data is already available at CrisisTrends, but the full data set will allow researchers to ask and answer more searching questions about problems like suicide and depression.

Keller wrote, in part: I know people are frustrated about gentrification happening in the city, but the reality is, we live in a free market society. The wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city. They went out, got an education, work hard, and earned it. I shouldnt have to worry about being accosted. I shouldnt have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day.


Does Googles newly branded Jigsaw project have an old imperial mindseteven embodied in its name? Julia Powles of The Guardian thinks so.


Tech and politics: Darren Samuelsohn offers Politico readers a guided tour of the sprawling network of volunteer coders who are fueling the Bern. Its a great piece, full of dueling quotes from different camps in the tech-politics arena. On one side are the new generation of DIYers like start-up entrepreneur Daniela Perdomo, the spearhead of feelthebern.org, who touts the efficiency and passion of organic grassroots contributions. On the other side are people like Hillary Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson, who takes a dig at all the headlines the Berniacs are getting, insisting that his teams focus on optimization will win the day.


The only note Samuelsohn gets wrong is in writing that The dispersed nature of Sanders operation may be familiar in the tech world, but its a novelty in politics... Actually, if you were there for the 2003-04 Howard Dean campaign, none of this is new; the Dean campaign was renowned for its decentralized support baseincluding an army of volunteer coders.


What is different about the Sanders coder base is that it is spinning its wheels in an age of ubiquitous social networking platforms. Those Hack4Dean coders were virtually connected back in 2003; now everyone (just about) is connected. Facebook was actually founded a few days before Dean ended his campaign, in fact. Now, according to a recent Pew Internet survey, 37 percent of American adults say that sometime in the past week they got information about the presidential election from Facebook. Local TV news is the top source (57 percent), cable TV news is second (54 percent), then national nightly network TV news (49 percent), followed by radio (44 percent). In terms of the news sites considered most helpful to learning something about the election, cable TV news ranked highest at 24 percent, followed by local TV news (14 percent), radio (11 percent), national nightly network television news (10 percent) and then Facebook (9 percent).

Crypto wars, continued: The FBI has asked Apple to build a new version of its iOS software so it can be installed on an iPhone recovered during its investigation of the San Bernadino terror attack, and company president Tim Cook has posted this letter to his customers, explaining why Apple is refusing to do so. He writes, in part:
The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customersincluding tens of millions of American citizensfrom sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe. We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.
 


Editorial comment: Leaving aside the arguments over strong encryption (which we generally support) and backdoors (which we oppose), its worth noting two things about Cooks action. First, unlike other tech companies battling the government, Apple so far hasnt used its platform power to astro-turf its lobbying. And second, in this case, its taking a principled position that may hurt its bottom line if political pressure grows. Not bad. (Now, about all those U.S. taxes youve avoided paying, Tim...)


Tech and politics: Hillary Clintons presidential campaign is seeing a surge in online donations, Tom Hamburger reports for the Washington Post. It now claims 750,000 individual donors, while the Bernie Sanders campaigns says it has 1.5 million. (The 2008 Barack Obama campaign hit 1 million donors at the end of February of that cycle.) Clintons digital strategist, Teddy Goff, told Hamburger, The Sanders team is doing a terrific job, and they are ahead of us in small donors. Our argument is that we are both doing a pretty good job. This is not a zero-sum game. The democracy is stronger when large numbers of people give small donations. We have 750,000 donors; Bernie has even more. Thats a great sign for the party.

Tech and politics: Writing for The New Yorker, historian Jill Lepore connects the collapse of the Republican and Democratic party establishments to the rise of the internet. As she notes, this may be the first Presidential-primary season with free Wi-Fi pretty much everywhere. But more seriously, she offers a warning:
Accelerated political communication can have all manner of good effects for democracy, spreading news about rallies, for instance, or getting hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition lickety-split. Less often noticed are the ill effects, which include the atomizing of the electorate. Theres a point at which political communication speeds past the last stop where democratic deliberation, the genuine consent of the governed, is possible. An instant poll, of the sort that pops up on your screen while youre attempting to read debate coverage, encourages snap and solitary judgment, the very opposite of whats necessary for the exercise of good citizenship. Democracy takes time. It requires civic bonds, public institutions, and a free press. And in the United States, so far, it has needed parties.

Small donors, big data: In 2004, Howard Deans presidential campaign built a grassroots base of 600,000 donors, largely by using the internet, and vaulted a formerly obscure small-state Governor to the top of the Democratic field, for a time. We all felt the muscle flex of this new progressive movement and were stunned by it, Nicco Mele, Deans webmaster, told me back then. Well, now a formerly obscure small-state U.S. Senator has been vaulted to the top of this years Democratic field, and overnight between Tuesdays New Hampshire primary and yesterday afternoon, we saw that muscle, rebuilt, flex again. In the 18 hours after the polls closed, the Sanders campaign reported raising $5.2 million, at an average of $34 per donation. In 23 hours, it hit $6.3 million, according to this Kenneth Vogel story in Politico (which does a nice job of profiling Tim Tagaris, one of Sanders key online strategists). By the evening yesterday, according to an ActBlue thermometer included in a follow-up email from the campaign, the Sanders haul had reached $7 million, a new record for one day during a president primary.


The one-day record for a fundraising email by a presidential campaign during a primary was previously held by the 2008 Ron Paul campaign, which invented the money bomb and raised $6 million from 58,000 donors on December 18, 2007 (the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party). The 2012 Obama campaign raised $10 million overnight after Sarah Palins acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, where she mocked him for being a community organizer.


New Hampshire has long been a great springboard for fundraising online; in 2000 John McCains upset victory over George W. Bush generated $1 million in such donations through his website, averaging $110 each. (Kids, candidates with websites and people making donations using credit cards was a novelty back then. It was a big deal in the fall of 1999 when Bill Bradley, the Sanders to Al Gores Clinton, announced he had raised $650,000 that way.)


Speaking of records, Kickstarter celebrated the 100,000th successful project on its crowdfunding platform a few days ago. Nearly 9.1 million people have pledged to those projects.

What sharing economy? Remember Airbnbs transparency press event at Civic Hall in December, when it invited members of the press to come view a spreadsheet of its New York City user data? A new report by Murray Cox of Insideairbnb.com and Tom Slee, author of Whats Yours in Mine: Against the Sharing Economy, shows the data was photoshopped: Airbnb ensured it would paint a flattering picture by carrying out a one-time targeted purge of over 1,000 listings in the first three weeks of November. Specifically, the company removed more than 1,000 entire home listings from its site, using the resulting data to argue that only 10% of those listings belonged to hosts with multiple listings. The true number had been close to 19% for all of 2015, Cox and Slee point out. The number of multiple listings is an indication of sharelords, people who arent just renting out a room or their own apartment on occasion, but using the platform to turn their properties into de-facto hotels and circumvent state laws.


Commenting on Cox and Slees report, New York state senator Liz Krueger, a longtime Airbnb critic, said, Far from being open and transparent, this report shows that Airbnb intentionally misled the press and elected officials in New York. The data clearly disproves Airbnbs perennial argument that they want to work with city officials to protect everyday New Yorkers, fight illegal hotel activity, and remove bad actors from their site. Instead, it appears the company took extraordinary onetime measures to manipulate data and make themselves look good on one day in one city.


Cox and Slees report has generated critical coverage in The Guardian, Re/Code, The Awl, and Fusion. Christopher Nulty, Airbnbs public affairs head for eastern North America, has responded to the report, arguing that most Airbnb users are single-listers, not sharelords. He says, Our community in New York has evolved to a point where 94 percent of hosts have just one listing and where there is no material presence of illegal hotels, which is why accusations from the same elected officials who called for there to be no illegal hotels on the platform and now want to fine middle class families $50,000 is akin to asking someone to walk on water and then, when they do, fining them for not swimming.

President Obama went to Springfield, Illinois, on the 9th anniversary of his launching his first campaign for the presidency to talk about fixing the nations politics, and issued a call for universal automatic voter registration and an end to partisan gerrymandering of election districts.


Crypto-wars, continued: Rep. Ted Lieu (R-CA) has introduced the Ensuring National Constitutional Rights for Your Private Telecommunications Act of 2016, or ENCRYPT. As Brian Barrett writes for Wired, its a short, straightforward bill with a simple aim: to preempt states from attempting to implement their own anti-encryption policies at a state level.


If the core conflict of the 21st century is between open and closed, as our friend Alec Ross likes to say, then Simon Oxenhams story on the rise of Sci-hub.com, a sort of Pirate Bay for academic science papers, is proof that open is winning.

Tech and the presidentials: After swiftly conceding to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire last night, Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook sent a memo to reporters promising a data-driven approach to maximizing delegates going forward and urging them not to make too much of the next two primaries compared to the delegate-rich votes in March. It reads, in part:
The way to win the nomination is to maximize the number of delegates we secure from each primary and caucus. That means, in many cases, that the margin of victory (or defeat) within a given state is actually more important than whether the state is won or lost. Thus, the campaign is building the type of modern, data-driven operation that it will take to turn voters out and win the most possible delegates.
The memo goes on to promise that each congressional district will have its own data-driven plan.The memo uses the word data-driven four times overall.


Upon winning the primary, Bernie Sanders made a live call for donations during his televised victory speech, which ActBlues Erin Hill tells First Post led to incoming traffic at historic levels. Some donors did experience a still processing message that appeared to hang, but Hill says, In big moments, we prioritize incoming contributions first, sending receipts and updating metrics later. Thats by design and that worked by design last night. ...Everything processed. There was a snafu with our thanks page UI, however, that caused donors to not get to the thanks page & leave some uncertainty about whether those contributions were completed. That was not by design and something we got fixed within an hour. But obviously not the experience we want donors to ever have, which is why we were also busy with concurrent real time customer service last night. (Shes too modest to say that she was still up at 4 am doing some of that customer service.)


Hillary Clinton knows what selfies are, but according to this report from Amy Chozick of the New York Times, shes not sure what it means for something to go viral.


As a fan of puns and culture hacks, heres a robo-call out to Aaron Black of Americans United for Change, who jumped on Marco Rubios robotic performance during last weeks GOP debate and started following the candidate around dressed in a silver robot costume and holding a #RobotRubio sign. After some Rubio supporters roughed him up, an incident that was captured on video, Black spoke to Politicos Nick Gass, saying, You know, I dont know what their major malfunction was, but I must have seriously pressed their buttons.

The Sunlight Foundations Politwoops site is back online, after being shut down by Twitter. The revived tool will now include every deleted tweet made by elected officials and candidates for office, and there are plans to expand to executive branch officials and state legislators.

Outspoken VC Marc Andreessen takes the opposite and ahistorical view, tweeting, Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now? As Kurt Wagner reports for Re/Code, the backlash was swift and fierce and ultimately the chastened Andreessen tweeted a full apology.

Take a minute to imagine youre a newcomer to the internet. First of all, you are not alone. The web has been around for decades, yes, but on the scale of the worlds population, regular connectivity is still technically a minority experience. With an estimated 3.3 billion internet users out of a world population of 7.2 billion, and a stunning 833 percent growth rate over the past five years, we can expect diversity on the internet to increase significantly, especially as the world internet population inches toward a tipping point.
Now imagine you dont speak English, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish or another majority language on the internet. Imagine you speak Bihari or Ilokano, minority languages in India and the Philippines, respectively. Again, your experience isnt unique. With the so-called next billion coming online, we can expect a significant increase in language diversity on the internet.
For English speakers, the internet might seem like a teeming wonderland of information and games and social connections, but for those who are just coming online, the internet has a dearth of contentif anyin their native languages. The pipelines for voice and civic action that weve seen for much of the world are facing a significant challenge: crossing language and cultural barriers.

For one, some languages are completely invisible and unusable on browsers, operating systems, and keyboards. In the words of Tibetan blogger Dechen Pemba, who cant access the Tibetan language on a phone:
Given that the Tibetan literary tradition goes back to the 7th century and its linguistic influence reaches far across the Himalayas encompassing areas of India, Bhutan, Mongolia, Russia and Pakistan, my pet hate is when Tibetan language is described as obscure. I wonder how it is possible that the language of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhists, comprising of as many as 60 million people, can be wilfully left behind in terms of modern technology? For instance, Google has failed to incorporate a Tibetan font into its Android software, failed to develop a Tibetan language interface and failed to include Tibetan in Google Translate, the most useful of tools. At least Apple has seen the light there.

In a recent series of lectures at UCLA hosted by the Digital Media Arts program and the Processing Foundation, I talked through some of these issues, drawing on an essay Id written for the Digital Asia Hub, a new think tank in Hong Kong thats grown out of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
Heres a summary of the key points I think we should be paying attention to with regards to the language biases inherent to our technologies. These are pulled directly from the Digital Asia Hub essay and transcripts from the UCLA talk provided by the terrific Open Transcripts, with minor editing to contextualize the words for this piece:
Language biases create sharp divides in the global weblaying the foundation for digital ghettos of information and community.
Without improved language and writing script support, new netizens run the risk of living in digital ghettos created by their native tongues. Any online actions they engage in or media they create will be largely invisible and unappreciated by those outside their cultural-linguistic spheres. This can have significant effects, for instance, on human rights advocacy, which can depend so heavily on using social media and email to raise awareness among international news sources.
New internet users who dont speak majority languages will likely be unable to participate in global internet culture and conversations as both readers and contributors. A number of internet researchers looking at language divides online have noted that minority languages speakers, especially those from the global south, will experience substantial information inequality online. Indeed, peoples inability to speak English can significantly affect their very adoption and use of the internet, even if they are aware of its existence.
The internet has proven to be a crucial pipeline for attention for those who have traditionally been marginalized. But language barriers can prevent the broader public from understanding their voices.
I think a lot of us are familiar with the internets role in building social movements and the ability to amplify ones perspective and words. Certainly the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong and the Black Lives Matter movement here in the U.S. rely on the ability to broadcast a message, to use hashtags, and to create a pipeline from social media to mainstream media, and then hopefully to other audiences.
And certainly we can think about major hashtags and major movements thatve been in English or a majority language: #TweetLikeAForeignJournalist in Kenya was a critique of media coverage of East Africa. And then #JeSuisCharlie, a simple enough French phrase for people to remember, understand and repeat online and offline.
But there are a number of other movements in other languages that are more difficult to understand, and get significantly less attention: Theres #sassoufit in Congo; theres the gau wu (#) movement, part of the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, but also a tangential group with different aims and strategies. As I argued at a recent panel on the topic of biased data, language is one important barrier that prevents these movements from reaching a wider audience.
Ultimately, language biases in our technologies are a full stack problem. These compound on each other, and as technologists, we have to think holistically about solutions.
In technology design we talk about the full stack, a series of the layers, such as the code and the user interface, on which software is built. As we note during the biased data panel discussion, human-facing part of that code is in English. Admittedly, much of code is constructed from simple phrases, like if and then. Yes, you can learn those phrases, but imagine trying to relearn code in a language that you dont speak, and suddenly having to learn two languages: the programming language and then the language in which the programming language is expressed.
And then it moves up to the typography pressures. The ability to input Arabic on a mobile phone up until recently was severely limited, and Arabic speakers developed Arabizi, a chat language made of Roman letters and numbers to express their language online. This was incredibly creative, but it was also a response to a lack of support for the Arabic script. This affects many other languages whose primary script is not Latin.
Then it goes up from there into content. If you want to engage with the broader internet, you have to have access, and we can include language as a form of access. As one example, Stack Overflow is a critical go-to source for the open source community and coders in general, but the majority of the knowledge on the site is only available in English and Portuguese right now. If someone who speaks neither language wants to ask a question from this rich community of more experienced practitioners, whom could they ask?
And then the stack moves all the way to the typography. Were talking about the political decisions around typography. In languages that use Latin letters, you have a wide variety of typography and fonts that you can use, and if you have that kind of critical knowledge about the implications of all these fonts you can really make important design decisions. But if you have access to only one or two fonts, suddenly the ability for you to create a space around the very content and the sites that youre trying to create again becomes limited and youre inheriting someone elses designs around your typography.
To be clear, language biases in tech are an extension of the language biases we live with in broader society. As we discuss what it means to speak American in this diverse, multilingual country, and as we look to a world multilingual internet, its important to remember how often language barriers manifest. Just recently, I wrote about U.S. candidates attempts at Spanish language engagement on Twitter, which sometimes falls flat for native speakers. Both Clinton and Sanders have been called to task online for their not-always-perfect Spanish:
https://speakbridge.io/medias/embed/democratic-debates-2016/democratic-debates-2016-general/725

https://speakbridge.io/medias/embed/democratic-debates-2016/democratic-debates-2016-general/706

This is a bias of content, one that is higher up on the technology stack, but that creates a barrier between a candidate and their electorate. Whether a language is misunderstood, or, like Tibetan, completely invisible, the barrier of understanding creates a barrier to access. Solving this at all levels will take a lot of work, but it will be essential for a truly interconnected, accessible, and civically-engaged internet.

Reichstag building, Berlin, Germany (Jurgen Matern, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikipedia)

Why Germany?
A couple of years ago I was idly scanning through Google Zeitgeist, the search giants annual data release of each years top search trends. Somehow I found my way onto the international results, and picking almost at random I chose to look at the search terms for Germany.
There, sitting at the top of the pile, was something I could barely believe. The term in poll position was Wahl-o-mat. Despite not being a German speaker, I recognized it: it was the brand name of a German website that helps people work out who to vote for.
Not a recently deceased TV star, or a major movie, or a massively viral YouTube video, but an old-fashioned, 36 question online quiz that ultimately spat out a suggested political party. Further searching revealed that it had been used, through to completion, over 13 million times in the 2013 national elections. Even more astonishing is the quiz is run by an arms-length public bodyeffectively a who to vote for service delivered by part of the state.
Since then, Ive been acutely aware that Germany has a social-impact technology scene that is somewhat unlike that of many other rich countries. So in January this year I set out on a trip to Berlin to find out about tech initiatives that might be a bit different from what you find elsewhere.
Context: the security and privacy scene
It is no great secret that Germany has been closely associated with the groundswell of discontent since the Snowden revelations. But I wasnt prepared for just how big and central it is to how all technology was viewed, or how widely the suspicion of digital technologies has spread.
The best yardstick of how big the security and privacy tech community is in Germany is to consider the attendance of the years biggest community shindig, the Chaos Computer Conference (CCC), held in Hamburg. There were an astonishing 12,000 people present this year, and demand for tickets still substantially outstripped supply. Nearly as many people go to CCC as go to Defcon in America, but in a country thats about four times smaller. And the number rises rapidly every year.
The concerns are much more widespread than the NSA reading German email, too. After a few days I realized that several people I talked to were using the word algorithm (referring to automated technologies like Facebooks wall) with a kind of distasteful wince. It was similar to the way that a lawyer might reluctantly use swear words when quoting a defendant in front of a judge. This is because the very idea of algorithmic sorting of content in social media has become a kind of dirty word in the tech communityyet another way that big institutions could exploit the rest of us. Poor Al-Khwarizmi, who gave his name to the mathematical concept, must be rolling in his grave.
Several people I talked to remarked that Berlin has become a kind of sanctuary to people who work for both well-known and obscure privacy enhancing technology projects. Living there meant not only more like-minded people to hang out with, it meant less hassle at airports, less likelihood of being followed around or interviewed, less of a feeling of being a bad or wanted person generally. You can buy more stuff with cash. Everyone speaks English, and many people the language of cryptography too. People were not naive about the fact that Germany has its own well-staffed security apparatus, but clearly it to this community it feels like a much more acceptable home than most other alternatives.
There wasnt any consensus about what led to Berlin becoming the hub of this community. More than one person strongly contested the almost-standard idea that the history of the Stasi and of the the Nazis has made the average German more worried about surveillance than the average Brit. I was told that Google and Facebook usage was sky-high in Germany, and that these behaviors at an aggregate just didnt fit the theory of national suspiciousness. Ultimately, I had no objective way of assessing why there is such a large security and privacy community in Berlin, but if it isnt due to the sad, violent history of this place then theres clearly some other very interesting explanation lurking. Theories on an encrypted post-card, please.
My final observation on the privacy and security scene is that the energy surrounding privacy tech and privacy laws has created opportunity costs for the wider civic and social impact tech scene. There were actually, overall, fewer big mainstream civic tech or social impact tech projects than I would have expected to find in a country with wealth, tech chops and political consciousness that Germany has. I suspect its because more than a few ideas die in the cradle, smothered by concerns about how user data might be abused. At least one person told me theyd seen this happen.
Impressive civic & social impact organizations I discovered on my adventure
I talked to a lot of people during my stay. The following list, which is in no particular order, simply attempts to give a taste of the interesting projects and people I met, rather than a verbatim record. If I spoke to you and youre not here, please dont feel slighted!
Correctiv
Following in the tradition of ProPublica, Correctiv is effectively the research and accountability arm of a major national newspaper, just without the newspaper attached. Very skilled at digging out stories from hard to parse data they had a great reputation amongst people I talked to. For example they were much praised for their award-winning piece around the downing of flight MH17, which they released in English, German, and Russian. This multi-lingual, web-first approach, tied to a pure investigation project is something I dont believe Ive ever seen before. An impressive bunch.
VerklagDenStaat (Sue The State)
Germany has operated a successful Freedom of Information website for a long time, FragDenStaat. More recently the team behind it set up a site thats all about suing the government if your initial attempt to extract information is unsuccessful. Its mainly about connecting to experts via an email list, and provides access to a database of key court decisions, and to external fundraising sites to help pay for your fight. So its less of a complex tech tool, and more of a web-hub bringing together pre-existing tools, people, and advice to get one particular kind of problem solved. But, despite its modest technical achievements, what I liked about it is that it was a step further along the chain than where most FOI sites have gone, digging into the legal fights where much of the important action actually happens.
Wheelmap
A simple idea to solve and important problem often brings out the best in civic tech, and this is definitely the case with Wheelmap. This five-year-old site is a crowdsourced site of places that are fully, partially or not-at-all wheelchair accessible. Its backed onto OpenStreetMap and so stretches internationally: I was surprised by how much data there was in San Francisco, for example. Their site claims nearly half a million crowdsourced entries since 2010, so this clearly is well beyond the interesting experiment stage.
Screenshot of the Wheelmap of San Francisco
Better Place
Most rich countries now have relatively straightforward donation websites. But Better Place seemed to be, well, better in many ways. First, unlike the market leader in the U.K., they have worked out a business model that allows them to charge a zero percent overhead on donations raised. And whilst free is a nice price, its no good if the business fails due to lack of funds. But theyve constructed an impressive cross-subsidy model where they sell white label versions of their tech and consulting to organizations that want to raise their own money for good causes. Business appears to be good, and their office had a real buzz.
Most people would be happy to rest on their laurels managing this achievement along, but founder Joanna Brandenbach deploys the surplus to run a think tank that publishes on a range of tech-and-society issues in Germany. So if you want to know how to scale and pay the bills with your civic tech venture in Germany, Better Place are definitely the people to talk to.
Open Knowledge Germany
The highly independent German chapter of the global Open Knowledge empire is perhaps most notable for running some of OKs most significant projects. As well as FOIA site FragDenStaat (mentioned above), and youth-coding project Jugend Hackt, it runs Code for Germany. This is probably the closest thing that Germany has to a civic hacker community waiting for a chance to break into government, and its definitely a force to watch (see below for the problem with German government tech).
Kiron University
In a world of a million MOOCs, it can be hard to know what is genuinely innovative or what is genuinely working in the higher education space. One thing that stands out from the crowd is Kiron University, a fascinating mixed MOOC and real-world university program set up specifically for refugees.
What could sound impossibly modish and tech-deterministic becomes much more interesting when the model is explained. Students are put through two years of MOOC-based courses, but if they stick with the program then they can get placement at a variety of actual university campuses, in Germany and various other countries.
Its too early to tell what sort of numbers will make it through, but I was impressed by the connection of virtual and physical. I hope their model works out.
Tactical Tech
Tactical tech is dedicated to the use of information in activism, and is headquartered in Berlin. They help campaigners in a variety of places (mostly outside Germany) to use tech tools to securely gather data and organize, and then make the most of the information they gather through campaigns both on and offline. Their most-used tool is a big set of guides to using your computing devices securely, something which is clearly going to see ever more use in the years ahead. Theyve also got some great skills when it comes to visualizing data for activism purposes. Along with the Engine Room, theyre definitely one of the places Id go if I was asked to help a campaigning organization stay safe in hostile digital terrain.
Screenshot of the Tactical Technology Collective website
The elephant in the room...
...is the total failure of the German government to even begin embracing digital.
Whilst Germany has a historical reputation for being one of the worlds most advanced countries when it comes both to engineering prowess, and to running a competent civil service, it looks like the government at both the national and local levels is screwing the digital pooch as badly as could be imagined.
Not only has there been no new establishment of a strong new digital center, like the USDS or the Government Digital Service, there was no word or rumors about even the tiniest of feelers being extended towards communities like CodeForGermany, which is where youd expect the next generation of government digital leaders to come from.
Some blamed this lack of government interest on the lack of a really big tech crisisthe recent failure to register refugees fast enough did cause some controversy, but nothing remotely comparable to the Heathcare.gov debacle, which was catalytic to digital progress in the USA. Others attributed the lack of movement to the post-Snowden environment, in which cool, usable digital tools becomes equated with export all the data to the USA/NSA. And yet others said that it was precisely because Germany does have hugely successful but hugely old-fashioned IT giants (SAP, Siemens) that change was so slow.
Whatever the explanation, a gap is clearly opening between the digital competence of German government and some of its traditional rich-country peers. And in the 21st century, where digital competence increasingly is the same thing as organizational competence, this means that a previously unimaginable governance gap is starting to open up. When and if the German governing elites finally notice that the land of Max Weber and Bismarck is no longer at the cutting edge of actually running a government, there will presumably be all sorts of fireworks. But from a digital government perspective it is fascinating to note that Germany is nowhere at all.
Happily civil society is very much somewhere. I hope that this post encourages others to look at whats going on just over the language barrier and report back to the civic tech world. If nothing else, you get to meet a lot of nice people in a very short amount of time.

This is civic tech: The great John Perry Barlow looks back on the 20th anniversary of his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. And while he expresses a few regrets (was it the champagne, he asks?) about his somewhat naive belief that the net would govern itself with consensus systems aimed at the commonweal, he asserts, I do not believe that the Nation State, for all its efforts to bring the Net to heel, has really succeeded. It is still the case that if one is reasonably savvy technically, he or she can express whatever they wish without fear of reprisal....The War between the Control Freaks and the Forces of Open-ness, whether of code, government, or expression, remains the same dead heat its been stuck on all these years.


Speaking of the forces of openness: New York City Council member Ben Kallos is pushing two bills, the Free and Open Source Software Act, which would minimize city contracts using proprietary software, and the Civic Commons Act, which would encourage the collaborative use of free and open source software among agencies, cities and states. The councils committee on contracting will hear testimony on both bills February 23.


Our Christine Cupaiuolo takes a close look at two technologies that British researchers have been using in conjunction with major political debates there. The first, Democratic Replay, is an open-source web platform that enables viewers to re-watch a debate with a full array of interactive visuals and analytics on discourse, audience feedback, debate topics (such as healthcare or the economy), and, in the future, data-mining tools that could answer such questions as, Did the candidate actually promise this last year? The second, Democratic Reflection, is an audience-response web app that enables viewers to choose in real-time from a panoply of nuanced responses, that range from straightforward (This is informative / Im losing interest) to more complex reflections (If s/he understood my situation, s/he wouldnt say this / S/hes provided convincing evidence for this claim). As she reports, the University of Leeds team that built the tool is open to discussions with media partners in and outside Britain interested in using the Democratic Reflection app in future debates.


Tech and the presidentials: It looks like some voters in New Hampshire have been receiving so-called voter-shaming mailers aimed at trying to push them to vote by supposedly comparing their voting history to their neighbors, but as Rachel Stockman reports for LawNewz.com, its not clear what campaign is sending them out.


Has presidential long-shot John Kasich been reading Sherry Turkle on the dangers of the digital age? Here he is talking at campaign event yesterday in New Hampshire, as reported by Ross Choma and David Corn for Mother Jones:
Our lives are being lived so fast. Were constantly on the device. The Apple TV...Have to get the new Apple phone. He held up an iPhone, as he continued: We have to slow our lives down and listen to peoples hurts and victories. He repeated this call to de-accelerate: When we do...its a more beautiful world.
 


Video satirist Hugh Atkin catches Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio debating with himself on whether or not President Obama knows what hes doing. The results arent pretty.


The almost-too-close-to-call Iowa Democratic caucus battle gets a detailed deconstruction from Darren Samuelsohn of Politico, who shows that party leaders in the state were not prepared for the way the Clinton-Sanders race tightened and precinct volunteers were often not interested in using Microsofts app for reporting caucus results.


Digital advertising firm Dstillery used location data to identify more than 16,000 mobile phones that appeared at caucus locations across Iowa, Donovan Slack reports for USA Today. The company found that sports fans and techies were more likely to show up at caucuses won by Marco Rubio or Bernie Sanders, where those who were into grilling, lawn and garden care, and other household DIYers were more likely at caucuses won decisively by Donald Trump.


International internet: Facebooks Free Basics program had only reached one million of Indias 252 million internet users, Reuterss Jeremy Wagstaff and Himank Sharma report. The decision by Indian regulators to effectively kill the program for violating net neutrality will likely embolden other regulators to demand equal access from ISPs elsewhere, they note.


Commenting on Mark Zuckerbergs Facebook page, Anil Dash tries to school the company CEO in the problematic history of Western colonialism in India, writing, A colonialist trust us, its for your own benefit pitch is a hard sell with good reason....What about pausing the Internet Basics effort and spending some time on a real effort to listen to Indian voices about what would help them have connectivity on their own terms, in a way they find acceptable? Zuckerberg kind of maybe gets it, replying I think youre right about focusing on following the local culture and empowering local entrepreneurs. The giant social networking company is also facing a setback in France, where regulators are giving Facebook three months to stop tracking non-users activity and to also end the transfer of personal data to the United States, Reuters reports.


BrokenToilets.org, a new online magazine about global development and culture, is looking for pitches from writers for articles about open data.

The Democratic Reflection app aims to gather nuanced feedback from political debate viewers. All images (c) the Election Debate Visualization Project.


 
 
Case Study: Election Debate Visualization Project
Country: United Kingdom
Research Team: University of Leeds: Stephen Coleman, Giles Moss (School of Media and Communication), Paul Wilson (School of Design); the Open Universitys Knowledge Media Institute: Anna De Liddo, Brian Pluss, Alberto Ardito, Simon Buckingham Shum (now at the University of Technology Sydney)
Debate: ITV Leaders Debate, April 2, 2015the only debate where all seven leaders of British political parties met in advance of the May 7 general election for the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Picture this: Youre watching a televised debate involving two political candidates, and one of them accuses the other of breaking a campaign promise. Theres a denial, followed by a cross-accusation. Pretty soon youre not sure if either candidate is telling the truth, but you are certain that theyre avoiding the central question, and the moderator seems unable to refocus the conversation.
Now, what if you could replay the debatebut this time, theres built-in fact-checking and data maps that track the arguments and show who violated the debate rules? And what if the viewing platform was interactive, so you could call up previous articles about an issue, pull in other viewers responses to the debate, and share your own?
What if, in other words, debates became more informative after the debate? Could the enhancements increase viewer comprehension, engagement, and political confidence?
Thats the question researchers working in Britain on the Election Debate Visualization (EDV) project are attempting to answer.
Robust political debate is common in the United Kingdom; the weekly Prime Ministers Questions has been broadcast live since 1990, drawing international audiences. The first televised election debates, however, didnt take place until 2010. They attracted strong public interest, but through a series of national surveys completed before and after the debates, Stephen Coleman, a professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, found that many viewers were left with questions on the issues and uncertainty about the candidates competing responses.
In 2013, researchers from University of Leeds, including Coleman, teamed up with data science experts at the Open Universitys Knowledge Media Institute (KMI), a research and development lab, on the EDV project. The three-year effort (it concludes this fall) aims to identify the information needs of various audiences and create interactive visualization tools that respond to those needs.
The analogy that I often use is that the debate is rather like trying to buy a car from someone who is a very fast-talking salesperson, said Coleman. What we want to do is to give you a chance to go home, sit at your computer, slow the whole thing down, take it apart, and really ask the questions that you want to ask.
KMI researchers had already been conducting some informal experiments around creating interactive maps that tracked argumentative moves during the 2010 prime-ministerial debates. They were eager to do more with debate rhetoric and computer-supported argument visualization (CSAV), which captures and presents argument structure. They also wanted to analyze fair play, a specialty of EDV team member Brian Pluss, a research associate at KMI who codes linguistic behavior. Also known as non-cooperative dialogue, fair play refers to how well a candidate sticks to the debate rules. Avoiding a question or interrupting another candidate would be considered violations.
With a grant from the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council, the EDV team set out to develop an open-source web platform that would allow viewers to re-watch a debate with a full array of interactive visuals and analytics on discourse, audience feedback, debate topics (such as healthcare or the economy), and, in the future, data-mining tools that could answer such questions as, Did the candidate actually promise this last year? They named it Democratic Replay and expect to release in May, with a tutorial explaining the components.
A schematic overview of the approach behind Democratic Replay: data is collected and analyzed to produce interactive visualizations synchronized to the debate video, and this becomes a hypermedia repository that is made available to users / (c) EDV Project.
But thats not the only interactive use of technology they are introducing to the debate experience. Early on in the collaboration process, as ideas were being tossed around, the project team decided to see if they also could create an audience-response web app that would provide genuine insight into voters attitudes and needs. It was outside the project scope (and unfunded), but they were motivated by voters wanting a say in the debates and the limitations of existing ways to capture feedback.  
In 2010, for instance, U.K. debate broadcasters introduced the worm, an analytic tool used to gauge audience responses. Using a control device, such as a dial, a pre-selected group of voters register approval or disapproval of the candidates comments, and the responses appear in a line graph on screen, wiggling like a snake or a worm. Some researchers have had concerns about the tools influence on debate viewers.
We agree with the view of the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications that the use of the worm might distort the viewers perception of the debate, EDV team members wrote in a 2014 project report, referring both to the small sample of participants and the fact that the worm only asks the audience to like or dont like what the candidates are saying. Theres no context.
More insight into voter reactions can be gained by analyzing Twitter activity during the debates, but this, too, is limited. If instant audience feedback is to be a new fact of political life, they concluded, we need better tools for capturing and interpreting what viewers and voters are thinking.
Gathering Debate Reactions
The audience-response appcalled Democratic Reflectionbegan as a paper prototype. EDV team member Anna De Liddo, a research fellow at KMI and leader of the Collective Intelligence and Online Deliberation group, proposed using flashcards to elicit more nuanced feedback.
Some of the original EDV flashcards used to analyze the Clegg-Farage debate / (c) EDV Project.
The team settled on 18 cards representing three categories: emotion (how debate viewers related emotionally with what they were viewing), trust (whether viewers trusted the person speaking or what was being said), and information need (if viewers had questions about the debate topics).
Collective intelligence systems generally require complex tasks to be broken down into smaller tasks, with the actions distributed across large collectives. Looking at how this could be applied to political debates, De Liddo focused on this question: How can we capture and harvest peoples feedback to the debate in a way that is light and non-intrusive enough so that people may be willing to react, but also in a way that is nuanced and detailed enough so that analysts can make sense of the feedback?  
The flashcards were designed to gather soft feedback, meaning that viewers voluntarily share what they are thinking or feeling. There are no intrusions, and no binary questions such as, Do you agree or disagree with the candidates response? This type of collective intelligence can be useful for analyzing both the viewers immediate experience and shifts over time.
On April 2, 2014, the team invited 15 students from the University of Leeds to demo the cards during a one-hour televised debate between Nick Clegg, then-deputy prime minister, and Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, on whether the UK should remain in the European Union. The BBC hosted the debate in front of a live audience.
The flashcard experiment was annotated within Compendium / (c) EDV Project.
Participants were encouraged to raise a card in the air at any time if it represented how they were feeling. The experiment was recorded so researchers could later code each response. They used Compendium, a software tool for mapping information, ideas and arguments with support for synchronized video annotation.
Pluss said the team initially thought the cards offered too many options. Debates can be complicated enough to follow without the added responsibility of choosing from 18 different reflections. To their surprise, the students not only engaged with the cards throughout the entire debate (researchers cataloged 1,472 times the cards were raised), they even started to combine several cards together to express more complex feelings.
When Pluss reviewed the video, he also realized the students started selecting the cards based on design elements. That gave us a lot of courage because we thought if they engaged with these pieces of paper like that, then maybe if we give them an app, its going to be even easier, he said.
Determining Democratic Entitlements
Around the same time the flashcards were being developed and tested, Coleman, along with two other University of Leeds researchers (Giles Moss, a lecturer in media policy, and Jennifer Carlberg, a doctoral candidate), asked groups of voters and non-voters about their experience with the 2010 televised debates and what they hoped to gain from future debates.
The Leeds team identified five demands, or entitlements, that people said the debates needed to fulfill in order for them to feel comfortable taking part in the democratic process:

They wanted to be addressed as if they were rational and independent decision-makers.
They wanted to be able to evaluate the claims made by debaters in order to make an informed voting decision.
They wanted to feel that they were in some way involved in the debate and spoken to by the debaters.
They wanted to be recognized by the leaders who claimed to speak for (represent) them.
They wanted to be able to make a difference to what happens in the political world.

The design of the focus groups was ambitious. Researchers looked at the relevance of debates in the broadest sense; that is, not whether the debates simply influenced viewers perceptions of the candidates, but what people need in the run-up to and during the debates to propel them to engage. (The interviews are also discussed in this report). This moved the focus from the politicians (suppliers of information) to the public (demanding information).
Why go to such trouble?
We were looking at this on the basis that Britain claims to be, as the United States claims to be, a democracy. In a democracy, you have a public which is in charge and which makes the most important decisions about its future, said Coleman.
Very often when political scientists talk about the public, what they say is, Oh, people cant understand that, or, This is too confusing for people. That wasnt really good enough for us. We wanted to know the answer to the question, What is it that makes this confusing? Is it inherently the case that the electorate is just dumb? Probably not. If not, then there are barriers in the way. If there are barriers in the way, what are those barriers? Are they barriers that are the same for everyone, or are they different for some people? Are they movable?
Coleman said getting to that point was made possible by the decision to go into the focus groups with a curiosity about what norms people would establish for themselves, instead of establishing a set of norms for them to meet. Besides being surprised about how forthcoming people were about what they needed to make democracy work for them, and how much people wanted the debates to involve them as well as inform them, the researchers were a little startled by the lack of interest in digital technology as a solution.
Theres an assumption that people are looking to digital technologies. They werent looking, said Coleman. Theyre looking for particular opportunities to do things rather than particular technologies that they think have got a magic solution.
Focus group participants came up with interesting ideas for improving the debates, said Pluss, including penalties for candidates who dodge questions. While such a suggestion would never pass the negotiation stagemuch like it is with debates in the United States, the debate format in the United Kingdom is decided after a long negotiation between the political parties and the broadcastersthe EDV team began to envision how technology could be used to deliver more of what the public wants.
If one of the politicians says something that has no evidential basis or that is plainly wrong, we can show it, and then make people aware of that, said Pluss. Even though we cant make changes to the debates themselves, with technology we can empower citizens. Thats one of the overall grand goals of the project.
From Flashcards to Web App
The Democratic Reflection app used during the ITV debate on April 2, 2015 / (c) EDV Project.
It took almost a year to turn the Democratic Reflection flashcards into a web-based app. The digital design ended up being similar, but the statements were restructured to extract meaningful insights around the entitlements identified in the focus groups. Coleman recalled arguments over Skype, debating whether to make the questions more colloquial, for example, or the options easier to analyze.
The choices now range from straightforward (This is informative / Im losing interest) to more complex reflections (If s/he understood my situation, s/he wouldnt say this / S/hes provided convincing evidence for this claim).
Peoples reactions are used to make sense and assess the debate, but from a people-perspective, said De Liddo, adding that this collective point of view would be impossible to capture otherwise in such a rich way and, most importantly, in a way that provides very specific insights on the democratic entitlements.
Additionally, people who did not watch the debate can eventually replay peoples reactions, and these can also be part of how they shape their opinion on the debate, she added.
In March 2015, researchers assembled a dozen Open University students and staff in an auditorium to watch the Clegg/Farage debate from a year ago. This time, instead of holding up flashcards, participants could open the Democratic Reflection app on their laptops, tablets, or smartphones and select from 20 color-coded reaction buttons. A second test that month was similarly structured, except participants from the University of Leeds watched the debate independently (on YouTube), at home or at work, to better simulate a real-world scenario.
Everything worked as expected. But all of these tests involved university students or staff, so the users were generally tech-savvy, and no consideration was given to their age, gender, or political leanings. There wasnt money in the budget to repeatedly test the app with a demographically representative sample of voters.
For that, the EDV team would have to wait until the main eventthe ITV Leaders Debate on April 2, 2015a year to the day of the original flashcard test.
One Test Becomes Two
In advance of the Leaders Debate, the EDV team turned to a polling company to recruit more than 300 people to use the Democratic Reflection app. Participants were given a pre-debate survey about their views on the election and a post-debate survey about the event and their experience using the app. At the end of it all, the team gathered data from 242 participants; some didnt watch all of the debate, or didnt complete both surveys.
Pluss said most users were active for the full two hours, with activity peaking near the end, during closing statements. The EDV team was concerned 20 buttons would making viewing more complicated, but that didnt seem to be an issue.
The Democratic Reflection app during the BBC debate (April 16, 2015), when the tool was made available to everyone. For this version, the team modified some of the statements and allowed users to choose the target of their responses / (c) EDV Project.
It leaves the question open to see how many [statements] people would be able to take, said Pluss, adding that some users indicated that they would have liked more options, particularly more emotionally charged responsesthe impolite things people say when theyre watching a debate and something happens that makes them yell at the TV.
On April 16, during a BBC election debate featuring the leaders of the five main opposition parties, the EDV team made the app available to everyone.
It wasnt planned as part of the study, and they did very little promotion, only a couple of tweets and a mention on the Open Universitys Facebook page. The server was optimized to support up to 700 users, said Pluss, and that night, as he watched the number of logins inching upward, he grew anxious. Close to 2,000 people joined in. Sure enough, the server crashed.
Obviously, if we had collected that amount of data without any interruptions, it would have been amazing, but the fact that we got that amount of interest, I think its wonderful, said Pluss. Its not that people were just coming in, taking a look, and leavingthey were actually wanting to interact.
In fact, that interaction is probably what caused the crash. The team had modified the platform, allowing users to view a live feed of other viewers reflections as well as their own responses.
The idea was to create a bit of a more of a social community kind of experience, said Pluss. Technically, thats what got us in trouble, because that stream of information, when you have such a high number of users, is huge.
The server was down for about five minutes. But Pluss considers the extra run a success of sorts: To his surprise, some users returned, and the EDV team ended up with about 400 streams of datanot useful for longitudinal data, due to the gap in the middle, but researchers could still study responses to specific moments of the debate.
Besides harnessing more data, said Pluss, It was amazing to see that people had the appetite for this concept.
The EDV team is open to discussions with media partners in and outside Britain interested in using the Democratic Reflection app in future debates. The entitlements on which the questions are based might be different, and the technology might be applied in different ways, but the ultimate goal of providing debate viewers with the means to express their emotions as well as their needs could be applied in any country, said Coleman.
When we were doing this in April and May of 2015, we were saying to each other, Wouldnt it be great if we could do something for the presidential election in the States in 2016? My guess is it is almost certainly too late for that, said Coleman, adding that Germanys election in 2017 might be a more realistic possibility.
What were looking at is who we can work with for the greatest public good, he added.  
Launching Democratic Replay
Democratic Replay will be made public in May as a tutorial website. It will include an analysis of data gathered from the Democratic Reflection app51,964 pieces of data to be exact, one for each time a viewer clicked on a reflection during the ITV Leaders Debate on April 2.
The EDV team is working on multiple layouts with programmer Alberto Ardito, a visiting research student from the Polytechnic University of Bari in Italy. One shows a timeline of audience responses; click anywhere on the timeline to bring up that point in the debate. Another option shows a histogram as the video plays. Theres also a feedback flower, its size corresponding to how many people chose a particular reflection during each 10-second segment.  
What our analysis will show is what was going on during the debate when people felt that particular entitlements were either being satisfied or being particularly not satisfied, said Coleman.
The Democratic Replay website will enable viewers to re-watch an election debate enhanced with interactive visuals and analytics, including audience reactions gathered through the Democratic Reflection app / (c) EDV Project.
Users will be able to filter the demographic profiles of viewers who provided feedback, making it possible to compare, say, how men and women responded to a candidates statement. Argument maps, fact-checking, and other components will also be available.
The EDV team finished the first iteration of Democratic Replay in October, five months after the electiontoo late to test if the platform could affect civic engagement or influence voting behavior. But between May and the end of the EDV project in September 2016, the team will continue to assess its use.
In the future, it might be possible to produce a Democratic Replay within a week of a debate, said Pluss. Thats well outside the 24-hours news cycle, but the team thinks the value is in turning the debate into an educational resource and a hub of data for journalists and other researchers.
As for the general public, the platform is going to be most useful for those who watched the debate, said Coleman. Both technologies, Democratic Replay and Democratic Reflection, are aimed at people who are taking some notice of whats going on, but who may not have followed everything closely or who have not yet decided who to vote for.
What I dont think Democratic Replay as a technology does is open up a lot of space for people who are completely disengaged from the process, said Coleman. I think that will involve us in a different piece of work.
It can be done, but I think that the problem is to throw everything in and try to take the disengaged, the engaged-but-confused, and then the engaged-but-highly opinionated all together and assume that you can create technologies for all of them. You cant, I think.
After all, this isnt the worm.

This is civic tech: Writing for TechCrunch, Stacy Donohue, investment partner at the Omidyar Network, offers three predictions about the rising fortunes of civic tech in 2016. First, a new wave of citizen engagement tools and platforms aimed at education voters and boosting voter turnout, like Change Politics. Second, more funding opportunities than ever, citing an internal study showing that 23 civic tech companies raised $285 million in 2015. And, third, more governments will embrace civic tech startups, citing the success of CityMart as one example.


Registration has opened for the School of Data, BetaNYCs civic tech and open data conference on March 5 here at Civic Hall.


International internet: In a huge victory for net neutrality activists in India, the countrys top regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, announced new rules today banning internet service providers from having differential policies for accessing different parts of the web, Reuters reports. The decision is a huge blow to Facebooks Free Basics program there. Heres the authoritys full statement.


On Friday, Twitter announced that it had suspended more than 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorists acts, primarily related to ISIS.


That news was quickly overshadowed by Alex Kantrowitzs story for BuzzFeed that Twitter was about to introduce an algorithmic timeline set off a firestorm of protest among loyal users of the app, leading Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to re-assure users that real-time feeds werent going away and that we never planned to reorder timelines next week.


Tech and the presidentials: According to former President Bill Clinton, after staffers from Bernie Sanders campaign took advantage of a database failure to access confidential Clinton campaign voter data last fall, in private they sent an email out saying that the Democratic party had left the keys in the car, and all I did was drive off, reports Jonathan Martin for the New York Times. Clintons harsh comments on Sanders, coming two days before the New Hampshire primary, mark a sharp shift in the ex-Presidents public role in the presidential campaign.


Note to candidates: Google Translate doesnt travel well. After observing how people are live-sharing presidential events in New Hampshire, An Xiao Mina of Meedan takes a close look at how social media works, or doesnt work, in translation. Attacks on the establecimiento sound like you are attacking a physical building, rather than el systema, for example.


How well did Ted Cruz and Hillary Clintons campaigns employ voting science in their get-out-the-vote efforts in Iowa? Harvards Todd Rogers and Adan Acevedo have the answer.

This is civic tech: In Civicist, Kristen Rouse, the founder of the NYC Veterans Alliance, describes how relationships she built after joining Civic Hall helped her win a big legislative victory here this past year.


Also in Civicist, SeeClickFix co-founder Ben Berkowitz offers some hard-won advice for other civic tech entrepreneurs on how to build a successful platform for engaging residents and city officials.


Former Los Angeles chief data officer and Code for America OG Abhi Nemani offers a useful list of 7 tactics for fostering 21st century civic life including creating collaborative hubs, pulling in civic-minded capital, opening up slots for civic innovators to work inside government, focusing attention through contests and dedicated media, educational programs, creating more civic apps, open data, and strengthening user engagement.


Making the rounds: the video presentation of Equipay, the Comedy Hack Day San Francisco 2016 Grand Prize winner. Dont be fooled by its formal description: Pulling data income data from U.S. Department of Labor, Equipay allows you and your friends to split the cost of a meal in accordance with gender and racial income inequalities.


Tech and politics: Some young women are using Tinder to campaign for Bernie Sanders, Joseph Bernstein reports for BuzzFeed.


Molly Longman of Cosmopolitan magazine went on Tinder while attending a bunch of rallies for most of the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, to see what kind of guys were nearby on the app. The results are pretty hilarious.


Classified information was sent to the private email account of Secretary of State Colin Powell and top aides of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, NBC News Ken Dilanian reports, suggesting that Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while Secretary wasnt unusual.


The FCC is close to finished updating rules for the Lifeline service to allow it to begin subsidizing Internet service to low-income Americans, Maria Trujillo reports for The Hill.


Crypto-wars, continued: Oscar-winning documentarian Laura Poitras is publishing a book February 23rd called Astro Noise: A Survival Guide for Living Under Total Surveillance, and as Andy Greenberg previews for Wired, its based on journals she kept detailing what its been like for her to be on the U.S. governments watch list for years.

First Post 



I am frequently asked what key factors have made SeeClickFix a successful platform for engaging residents and officials where others have failed. These ten key principles that have been translated into product and design decisions have led to a rapidly growing platform that constructively solves problems while making government officials look good in the process. We believe these principles can be applied to other civic tech efforts and leveraged for more inclusive, representative governance.
The following is a list of biases and opinions that have been baked into the SeeClickFix platform over the past 8 years. It is not meant to be exhaustive and it is evolving as we learn more about the community we serve.
1) Transparency
SeeClickFix was launched because we were concerned that the opaque 11 protocols (phone calls and email) for managing citizen communication was crippling participation and strengthening distrust in government. Where legally possible communication with government and communication with residents should be immediately available to the public. This is different than an open data or FOIA policy which makes records available after the government has processed them. Real-time transparency maximizes overall efficiency by deceasing the duplication of public communications and internal government work. Feedback Loops have a stronger impact when they are published to everyone.
2) Feedback loops at every step
When you report an issue on SeeClickFix you are immediately sent an email that your issue has been created. In that email you are told who from the government has received the email as well as how many neighbors were sent a message. When you check out your issue you can see how many times it has been viewed and all of the public responses and the number of people who are following along. When the status changes on the issue (Open>Acknowledged>Closed) or a comment is made you receive an update. With feedback loops nothing is lost in a black box. With transparent and immediate feedback loops everyone can see the responsiveness of government and word of mouth spreads to others who are encouraged to show-up and communicate constructively. Twitter, Medium, Facebook and every other successful communication platform leverage stats (likes, follows, reads, shares) to encourage more engagement. This is no different and your government product needs to be thinking about creating feedback loops at every step.
3) Resident experience must rival experience with popular consumer applications
Theres no reason why digital engagement with your government cant feel like digital engagement with your friends and family. The experience needs to be well designed, meaning that a product person is listening and responding to the needs of the market. The experience should also be beautiful. Interacting with government should not feel like a lesser form of digital interaction designed by a time traveler from the late 90s. People fall in love with products that feel like they are designed for their needs and speak to their aesthetics. People can fall in love with their government for the same reasons.
4) Official experience must be as good as resident experience
If you are in local government and you want to engage residents, you need to do it in a way that benefits your co-workers, managers, and direct reports as well. Admittedly, this is not where SeeClickFix started but its where we live today. Incorporating gratitude into the platform for those that are creating the feedback loop can be done in a number of ways. SeeClickFix has a thank you button that residents use to praise local officials when a request is finished. As external communication increases, the product needs to make communication simple, easy and convenient. More residents engaging can translate to more work produced but it does not have to translate to more work done.
5) Understand that residents and officials are users of a bigger ecosystem than one government
Residents and officials live and work in multiple communities served by multiple public agencies. Software needs to acknowledge this and provide officials and residents opportunities to talk to each other beyond the traditional boundaries created by one-off systems. SeeClickFix users can report an issue in their county, their city, a neighboring town and to even smaller entities within towns like universities and housing authorities. Preaching regionalism feels like preaching to the choir these days. Still, many overlook software design and procurement as an opportunity to realize a regional vision.
6) Anonymity
Wherever possible residents and public employees should have the opportunity to participate in two way civic conversation anonymously. Studies have shown that communities that are previously disengaged are more likely to participate if they can do so anonymously. Put good community flagging features in place and terms of service that favor respectful communication and the concerns for trolling will be behind you. SeeClickFix is one of the largest digital platforms engaging people in government but trolling and disrespectful communication is minute, isolated and easily controlled. Anonymity is a baby quickly thrown out with the bath water on the web. In civic tech its a must.
7) Meet users on equal ground
A citizen needs to have equal say in the tools they use to communicate with government if communication is going to be a truly empowering to residents. This means the software that you are using for internal communication needs standardized APIs for other software applications to connect. Its also important that residents are treated as equals. If a request is not resolved, the resident should be given the same opportunity to reopen the issue that a government has to close it out. I think this can apply in others areas of civic tech but maybe this is esoteric to request management and open 311. This is how trust is built in both directions.
8) Features should empower citizens to be more helpful than they previously thought was possible
At SeeClickFix we have enabled anyone to receive alerts, claim responsibility, and help out even when they are not ultimately responsible. As a result neighbors have helped out other neighbors in snow storms, cleaned up parks, helped to spread important civic information and offer suggestions for improving traffic safety and general quality of life. If your engagement strategy is working well residents will feel like they are helping and officials will feel like they are being helped.
9) Be portable
City Hall does its best engagement when it shows up at community meetings outside of the doors of City Hall. Your digital product should take the same approach. SeeClickFix achieved early growth in the community through its widget which can be embedded on a local news site, a community group blog as well as the Citys website.
10) Iterate
At SeeClickFix we persistently take advantage of the ability to push updates to our government partners and resident users continuously. We built dynamic mobile apps where service requests, buttons and other local customizations are dynamic and can be updated remotely without resubmitting to app stores. The days of legacy software installed on premise are gone. Your government software like your government has the ability to respond iteratively to the needs of its community.
In the spirit of #10 I will continue to iterate on this list as we learn more. These values are what make SeeClickFix so powerful. Without them the platform would be a shell of itself, not have created meaningful change and likely failed. As one of our spiritual leaders Micah Sifry once said, Civic tech cant be neutral.

This is civic tech: Conteneos CEO Luke Hohmann previews this months participatory budgeting project for the city of San Jose, where the company has worked with local officials since 2013. The target is 1,000 people in in-person sessions and 50,000 people participating online with our Decision Engine to prioritize how San Jose should invest the portion of its budget devoted to programs and services that affect San Joses neighborhoods, he tells Kathleen Goolsby of Sandhill.com. This is a zero-based budgeting opportunity in which the budget allocation from the prior fiscal year will stay the same, but the set of programs and services will change based on resident feedback.


As part of the Obama Administrations Connect Home broadband initiative, which says that every child should have access to high-speed affordable Internet, Google Fiber has announced that it is giving a few hundred residents of public housing projects in Kansas City free gigabit internet service, promising to do so for residents in all public housing properties that we connect to in that city and boasting that it will eventually reach more than 1,300 families in nine properties. The company says it will bring similar free service to select affordable housing in other Fiber cities. Yahoo! At this rate, free gigabit service from Google will reach the 45 million Americans who cant afford high-speed broadband sometime in 11016 A.D. (Alphabet, Googles parent company, is one of the worlds top two most valuable companies at the moment, worth around $550 billion.)


The Marshall Projects Maurice Chammah reports on how cops in East St. Louis are using HunchLab, a predictive policing tool made by Philadelphias Azavea (a B Corporation), to help them decide which so-called hot-spots in the citys neighborhoods are in need of more attention. As Chammah notes, unlike other companies in the predictive policing marketplace, Azaveas rhetoric is civic-minded; the companys other projects include tools to analyze legislative districts, as well as an app that helps city residents map the locations of trees in order to study their environmental impact. Chammahs article is worth a close readunlike many pieces on predictive policing, it doesnt overstate the value of the technology and it is careful to give voice to critics like the Massachusetts ACLUs Kade Crawford, director of its Technology for Liberty program, who see the whole field as only adding a veneer of technological authority to practices that still disproportionately target young black men.


Tech and politics: DeRay Mckesson, a leading independent activist in the Movement for Black Lives who rose to prominence by his adroit use of Twitter, has announced that he is running for mayor of Baltimore, joining an already crowded field, as John Eligon reports for the New York Times. The Democratic primary there is April 26.


Google is starting a pilot program with NGOs using the companys Adwords grant program to enable them to run ads against terrorism-related search queries of their choosing, in an attempt to boost counter-radicalization efforts by those groups, Ben Quinn reports for The Guardian. (Early reports on this project incorrectly stated that Google would be redirecting search results to anti-radicalization sites.)


Building on a network analysis of 120,000 individuals from the LittleSis database of politically connected Americans and the timing of their campaign contributions to Barack Obama or John McCain in the 2012 election, a Dutch political scientist named Vincent Traag has found that the likelihood of someone donating increases not only when someone in their personal network gives to a candidate (hello, bundlers!), but also when they see people from other networks that they are weakly linked also giving. Our findings suggest that appealing to constituencies of diverse backgrounds may actually aid in diffusing support through networks, Traag tells MITs Technology Review.


Crypto-wars, continued: A United Nations panel , the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has ruled that Julian Assanges confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy in London amounts to his being arbitrarily confined, the BBCs Caroline Hawley reports. The WikiLeaks founder has said that if the panels ruling went the other way, he would leave the embassy and accept arrest. The panels ruling is not legally binding, but as Hawley notes, Previous rulings by the panel have gone against countries with some of the worlds worst human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and Egypt.


A group of political activists and leaders of internet rights groups including La Quadrature du Net and Access Now are criticizing Twitter for alerting them when their accounts are attacked by state-sponsored actors but then releasing no information indicating which country is probing their personal information, Bethany Horne reports for The Guardian.

Kristen, center, holding the pen used to sign legislation creating an independent Department of Veterans Services for New York City.
This blog post is adapted from a short address given by Kristen Rouse, one of four Civic Hall member-honorees, at our first year anniversary party February 1. Rouse is a three-term Afghanistan veteran who founded and runs the NYC Veterans Alliance. The other members honored for their accomplishments this past year are Chana Ewing of littlebigGirl + CO, Marek Banczyk of Cityglobe, and Erin Vilardi of VoteRunLead.
I joined Civic Hall last June when I heard about the Craigconnects scholarship for veterans. I had no income from any of my advocacy work, and I was overwhelmed with writing and editing the first ever in-depth report on NYC veterans policy. It was a lonely process that mostly involved me sitting by myself in pajamas in my tiny Brooklyn apartment, feeling isolated and like I might never see any of this through.
The Craigconnects veterans scholarship got me into Civic Hall, and Civic Hall got me out of my apartment and out of my pajamas, and interacting with a community thateven though most of you arent veteranscould definitely understand what I was going through.
Since then, Ive managed to build an organization and a team of veterans like Elma [Sanchez], Sam [Innocent], and Javier [Alvarado], and bring in service providers and civilian supporters, too. We now have more than 150 dues paying membersincluding Craig Newmark, who made all of our work here possible to begin with.
Because of Civic Hall, I learned about NationBuilder, and chose that as the online platform weve used for our website and for outreach to the NYC veterans community. Weve also used it to create a consolidated Community Calendar that since August has listed more than 250 events for veterans across the New York Metro areasomething that never existed before.
Civic Hall has been where weve brought members and stakeholders to talk about policy issues that matter to them. Last December, some of you came to our Policy Design Workshop, where veterans whove served in every era since Vietnam were able to collaborate in a new way to solve problems for our community. I wasnt sure how to put on a design workshop, but when I mentioned it to [Civic Halls] Jenn Shaw, she connected me with Ange Royal-Kahin from Engine, who showed our team of veterans how to do it and make it a success.
We had some major wins in 2015, with our biggest being the passage of legislation creating an independent Department of Veterans Services for NYC, which we had strongly advocated for in 2015. I got to stand behind Mayor de Blasio in the signing ceremony at the Intrepid last December, and I received the first pen he used to sign that bill into law. Afterward, I was proud to come to Civic Hall and tell this community about our victoryand to show off that pen. Because this community understands how big of a win that is, and how hard we worked to get there.
But were not just telling you about our successyoure taking part in it. Were developing partnerships with [fellow Civic Hall members] Melanie [Lavelle] from Benefit Kitchen and David [Moore] from Councilmatic, and Ive personally benefited from webinars put on by Rhize, and were getting involved in VoteRunLead to hopefully get women veterans into elected office. (And we want our veteran men in office, too!) All of this, I hope, is just the beginning of having veterans involved as an integral part of the civic tech movement.
Just two weeks ago, Ed Potter, Civic Halls Slack evangelist, got us to start our own Slack teamand Im becoming a Slack evangelist, too. In just two weeks, we have more than 40 of our members talking about veterans policy issues on a bunch of channels, and I even have Vietnam veterans on there taking the lead on the conversation.
Id like to give special thanks of course to Craig Newmark, and to Jenn [Shaw], Ellen [Mendlow], Marissa [Mlotek], Jo [Ladzinski], and the other amazing staff at Civic Hall for believing in me and connecting me and my team with this great community. Heres to many more years of Civic Hall changing the game for veterans and for our city, country, and world.

The Uber Bowl: Thousands of Uber drivers are planning to assemble Sunday in San Francisco to disrupt traffic around the Super Bowl, Mike Dean reports for the Observer. 1,000 drove in protest through the city on Monday to protest the companys fare cuts.


Related: Noam Scheiber reports for the New York Times on rising labor conflicts not just aimed at Uber, but also Lyft and Postmates, highlighting the Good Work Code being championed by the National Domestic Workers Alliance as a response. Uber drivers in Dallas and Seattle have succeeded in collectively pressing the company for some policy reversals, Scheiber reports. In Tampa several hundred protesting drivers have started an weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers, he reports, using Zello, an app-based walkie-talkie service, to communicate with each other.


Note to self: In the digital age, a walkout by on-demand workers is to be called a logout. (And I remember when we thought logging in was the radical move.)


Tech and the presidentials: Conversational trends on Twitter and search trends on Google both gave a clear inkling that Texas Senator Ted Cruz was going to finish strong in Iowa, Marcus Gilmer reports for Mashable.


Donald Trumps failure to listen to advisors telling him to invest more in tech and data for voter targeting allowed him to get out-organized in Iowa, Kenneth Vogel and Darren Samuelsohn report for Politico.


Many of the presidential candidates are responding to questions about the internet and cybersecurity, but as Tim Karr of Free Press writes, the bad news is none of them seem to know what theyre talking about.


This is civic tech: The Sunlight Foundation has just launched Hall of Justice, a massive data inventory on criminal justice in America. It includes nearly 10,000 datasets and research documents from across the states and the federal government.


Spying times: The proposed Snoopers Charter legislation in the UKofficially the Investigatory Powers Billis so vague as to permit a vast range of surveillance actions, with profoundly insufficient oversight or insight into what Britains intelligence, military and police intend to do with their powers, writes EFFs Eva Halperin and Danny OBrien. They add, It is, in effect, a carefully-crafted loophole wide enough to drive all of existing mass surveillance practice through.


European and American negotiators have reached a deal renewing safe harbor regulations allowing American tech companies to keep moving peoples digital data across the Atlantic, Mark Scott reports for the New York Times. The deal still has to be approved by the EUs member states. And as Techdirts Mike Masnick cogently notes, the core issue that is still unresolved is whether the US government will stop indiscriminate mass surveillance of personal data of foreigners that moves through US-based servers.


A group of 11 U.C. Berkeley professors are objecting to a new internal web traffic monitoring program put in place at the behest of the University of Californias president, Janet Napolitano, the former national director of the Department of Homeland Security, Steve Lohr reports for the New York Times. My primary concern is monitoring the private information of students and faculty in secret, said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science.

Tech and the presidentials: Sasha Issenberg, pretty much owning the data-driven campaign beat again in 2016, reports for Bloomberg Politics on Ted Cruzs voter targeting operation in Iowa, known inside the campaign as the Oorlog Project (taken from the Afrikaner word for warand as far as we know not an endorsement of apartheid, just some staffers delight in the words sound). Some nuggets: Cruz came against Iowas fireworks law because his analysts had identified 60 votes who could potentially swayed by it, something they discovered by experimenting putting micro-message ads in the Facebook feeds of self-identified Iowa Republicans. Ah, democracy at work.


Perhaps a day late on its relevance, heres Ben Smith, editor in chief of Buzzfeed, reporting on how dethroned GOP frontrunner Donald Trump dominates the media, new and old.

Crypto and privacy: A new study from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard argues that the fears of government agencies that strong encryption will let evildoers go dark are outdated by the emerging Internet of Things, where user privacy is essentially non-existent. As Xeni Jardin cogently points out on BoingBoing, Basically, theyre saying the government wont have any problem tracking us and surveilling our communications, because were freely sharing a lot of very revealing personal data and metadata to third parties, all day, every day, security be damned.


Life in Facebookistan: Facebook has started sharing more audience optimization data and from that Dieter Bonn and Brian Abelson at The Verge have produced the definitive list of what everyone likes on Facebook. Bad news: Government ranks just below Gyms, but ahead of Animated films. Politics is way, way down: just below Justin Bieber but above France.


What sharing economy? Hundreds of Uber drivers in New York City went on strike yesterday to protest cuts in fares made by the company, the New York Times Marc Santora and John Surico report. One driver, Tsering Sherpa, said the lower rates would force him to work 10 to 14 hour days, declaring, They call us partners. But theyre treating us like slaves. Uber says it has lowered prices to get more people using Uber, which is good for drivers because it means less time waiting around for trips.


Dont miss Steven Johnsons eloquent rebuttal of Paul Grahams defense of inequality as the engine of Silicon Valleys tech innovation. Most intriguing is Johnsons argument that the tech sector is actually more egalitarian than most American businesses for how well it rewards employees at all levels, and suggests that a maximum income ratio of 40-to-1 would fit quite easily within the parameters of what most Valley companies now provide their workforces. Johnson writes:
Right now the tech market, even with its admirable pay ratios, is signaling to the world that inventing a new app for teenagers to flirt and banter can be thousands of times more valuable than becoming a high-school principal in a troubled district. That is a ratio with real costs to society. And I say that as a believer in these technologies!

A PB voting site in East Harlem. (Lex Paulson, Democracy 2.1)

Last week the Ash Institute For Democratic Governance and Innovation published Civicist contributor Hollie Russon Gilmans first book, Democracy Reinvented: Participatory Budgeting and Civic Innovation in America. What follows is a short Q&A with Gilman about her new book and what the future may hold for participatory budgeting and other civic technology trends.
Civicist: First of all, participatory budgeting is relatively new to the U.S. Although it started in Brazil in 1989, it wasnt practiced in the U.S. until 2009, and is still quite rare. How is participatory budgeting different in the United States than in other countries?
Hollie Russon Gilman: Thats a great question. Participatory Budgeting (PB) in the United States has so far been working through existing political structures. In some places PB becomes its own structure alongside traditional bureaucracy. The U.S. process has often been implemented on the district level with elected leaders who have capital fundsthings that can fund bricks and mortar. In other places, PB funds sometimes come from a centralized pot and are not always limited to capital funds. The amount of money being put into the process in some places is much higher. For example Paris is putting 426 million euros into the process over a six-year period.
Is there a canonical definition of participatory budgeting?
While there are numerous exact definitions of PB, some that are more or less binding, for the tenets of the book I define PB as: (1) a replicable decision-making process whereby citizens, (2) deliberate publicly over the distribution of, (3) limited public resources, arriving at decisions which are then implemented.
The New York Times has called participatory budgeting revolutionary civics. How revolutionary is it, really?
I think its revolutionary in so far as it is simply about empowering citizens to make governance decisions. In theory, this is not revolutionary at all! But our politics have become so partisan and contested; the very concept of bringing diverse people together has started to seem revolutionary. Perhaps, the most revolutionary aspect is that PB is simply returning politics to a more localized ideal.
The book includes several in-depth case studies; which did you find to be the most interesting or surprising?
Time and time again I saw people who became involved from initial curiosity, or even skepticism, become deeply engaged and staying involved over the course of several months. People stayed because they found the process to be fulfilling and they often forged new connections with neighbors, elected officials, and their community. These relationships were profound and often transformative.
What are some of the biggest challenges facing participatory budgeting and other efforts to increase civic engagement?
A process like participatory budgeting requires resources and time to effectively engage people, including from elected officials, civil society leaders, and people. Further, the funds to run process itself can be difficult to fund raise around. The process is very well structured which takes hard work. In New York City, the Participatory Budgeting Project has worked closely with Community Voices Heard, a local membership based organization that focuses on women of color and low-income families, to support and expand the process.
What are some of the key policy recommendations you make to encourage these kinds of participatory practices?
I have worked with some government officials who are excited to engage citizens in decision making but are also concerned about how to manage the floodgates of citizen input. There is a general concern that in an environment where people are already overworked and understaffed that engaging people without adequate staffing capacity will lead to deleterious results. One potential recommendation is to work closely with allies and strategic partners, including foundations, civil society, and universities, who can lend additional capacity. Another recommendation is to create processes that are fully transparent from the onset. This can help manage participants expectations throughout. People understand that some public sector employees have limited capacity; explaining a process to people, including its limitations, can go a long way.
What should we be looking for in the next few years? Whats the next big participatory thing, do you think? What, if anything, should we be wary of?
We will continue to see experiments combining online and offline tools. I think this can offer many exciting opportunities for reducing barriers to entry and engaging previously marginalized residents. As we often talk about with technology, it can be used to strengthen and support participation but we also need to ensure that it supplements, not entirely replaces, face-to-face participation. As further digital tools are integrated into participatory mechanisms, questions surrounding access, equity, privacy, and digital literacy will be front and center.
Can you elaborate on how PB is incorporating online tools?
In 2015 New Yorks PB used electronic ballot counting and a partnership with Textizen, which started as a Code for America project. The City Council has created a web-based mapping tool for gathering crowdsourced public input for project submissions. The geo-targeted maps enable people to drop a pin on a map and provide ideas, suggestions, and comments. The maps are powered by OpenPlans open source technology. As covered by Jessica McKenzie on Civicist, in the 2015 PB vote, New York City employed a digital ballot experiment with both iPads for mobile kiosks and computers for in-person voting. They partnered with Stanford Universitys Crowdsourced Democracy Team and Democracy 2.1 to test alternative ways of voting with the goal to make voting as easy an ATM. For 2016, New Yorks PB is slated to conduct the first-ever remote online voting with an integrated online/offline ballot.
This reflects the push throughout global deployments of PB to use more digital interfaces and explore the opportunity for SMS to reach non-traditional participants. The first use of SMS was in 2004 in Ipatinga, Brazil. A World Bank pilot in the city of Jarabacoa, in the Dominican Republic, used SMS to encourage face-to-face participation, using a message targeted specifically at women. As Rafael Cardoso Sampaio and Tiago Peixoto note in Hope for Democracy: 25 Years of Participatory Budgeting Worldwide, online voting can be seen as the gateway for politically inactive or less active citizens. The fact that online participation is generally more affordable can certainly be an extra attraction.
I am optimistic for the opportunity to leverage civic tech combined a place-based local approach to engage citizens.

Iowa watch: Joe Rospars, the founder and CEO of Blue State Digital, draws on his seminal experience in digital campaigning for Howard Dean and Barack Obama to produce a very smart analysis in the Washington Post of the dynamics of the Clinton-Sanders presidential battle. Rospars points out that both candidates teams inherited an ingrained culture of constant testing and data-driven optimization that shapes every ad, every email, every call script for a volunteer and every list of voters they call. And both campaigns have built their organizing efforts on the foundation of tech and data infrastructure at the Democratic National Committee that first came together in the 2008 cycle.


Rospars, who is neutral in the 2016 primary, also notes that whether you support him or not, Sanderss campaign is the home of the prevailing grass-roots energy in this race. The most recent financial reports, for the period that ended in October, showed that the amount Clinton raised from donors giving less than $200 decreased from $8 million to $5.2 million, while Sanderss low-dollar take nearly doubled, from $10.4 million to $20.2 million. Clinton raised barely a quarter of the amount from grass-roots donors that Sanders did. Whatever the ultimate result, that shows the Sanders campaign has accomplished extraordinary things in volunteer mobilization and small-donor fundraising, period. The Sanders campaign announced that it will bring in $20 million in January, Matea Gold reports for the Washington Post, calling it an astonishing sum that underscores the power of its online fundraising operation.


While you wait for the Iowa caucus results, you can take a trip down memory lane with Esquires Jack Holmes, who has gathered an oral history of YEAHHHHHHH! from a gaggle of former Howard Dean campaign staffers.

From what Issenberg details, the Clinton team has a customized campaign plan for each of the states 1,681 precincts.


Republican Ted Cruzs campaign is reportedly doing a lot of behavioral targeting, but a mailer sent to some Iowans warning them that they had a failing voting score was denounced by Iowas secretary of state, who says There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting, reports Mother Jones Pema Levy. Hilariously, one of the people who received a Cruz mailer was Iowa State University professor David Peterson, who runs the journal Political Behavior, and who told Levy that his own alleged voting score was inaccurate. (Every one of his neighbors who received the same mailer got the same score.)

This is civic tech: Building on David Moores essay yesterday about the need for open data standards for civic information, Mark Headd of Accela chimes in, asking What organization(s) have the clout, impartiality and durability to bring together disparate interests and help craft a new data standard?


Speaking of open data, the FCC just voted to require all but the smallest cable, satellite, and radio stations to upload their political files, which reveal who is buying what ads and when they run, online. As Libby Watson points out on the Sunlight Foundation blog, these files are technically open public records but only available for viewing on paper at each stations office. This FCC decision will make Sunlights Political Ad Sleuth tool far more useful.


Presidential Innovation Fellows Kate McCall-Kiley, Luke Keller, and Adam Bonnifield go behind-the-scenes on the development of Vote.USA.gov, a new platform they built in just two weeks that helps citizens find out how to register to vote in their state. They also report that Facebook has partnered with the site, using its tools to alert users to state registration deadlines, writing With the help of this Facebook pilot, more people registered to vote in one day than did so in the entire previous two weeks.


Tech and the presidentials: Snapchat has started a political campaign show anchored by former CNN reporter Peter Hamby, Steven Perlberg reports for the Wall Street Journal.


Presidential campaigns are uploading their email lists and voter files to Facebooks advertising network, which then matches real-life voters with their Facebook accounts, Harry Davies and Danny Yadron report for the Guardian. This is allowing campaigns like Ted Cruzs to target voters on a range of broad issues like immigration controls to niche specific causes such as abolishing state laws against the sale of fireworks. The company is also finding users who like lots of political content and share it with their friends, mark[ing] them as political influencers and allow[ing] campaigns to target them specifically.


As the Guardian reports, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks COO, told investors on an earnings call Wednesday that the 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spend, adding Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. And were seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting. Luckily, Facebook is helping more voters register too (see above item).


Whither privacy? With signs that the Federal Trade Commission is going to start policing privacy violations more stringently, business lobbyists are mounting an active campaign to delegitimize its efforts, Chris Jay Hoofnagle, UC Berkeley privacy expert, writes for The Hill.

Something to like: Remember Facebooks experiment in giving its staff a taste of the slow internet service its poorer users experience in the developing world, which was supposed to help them be more empathetic. Well, the guy who signed off on that idea, Chris Cox, Facebooks chief product officer, is now leading the companys push to drop its Like button for a new, more varied feedback tool called Reactions, reports Sarah Frier for Bloomberg Business.

President Barack Obama joins a toast with Technology Business Leaders at a dinner in Woodside, California, Feb. 17, 2011.
 (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)

In long dinners with Silicon Valley titans, [President Obama] has talked extensively about ways to better use personal technology to increase voter turnout and improve civic engagement.

  For Gadget Geek in the Oval Office, High Tech Has Its Limits, The New York Times, January 24, 2016
SCENE: A table in the private upstairs dining room of the White House. Seated around it are BARACK OBAMA (POTUS), REID HOFFMAN (LinkedIn), ERIC SCHMIDT (Google), MARK ZUCKERBERG (Facebook), BILL GATES (Microsoft), MARK PINCUS (Zynga), TRAVIS KALANICK (Uber) and others not listed in the White House Visitors Log. Dinner has just finished, and the President is enjoying his post-prandial drink of choice, an extra-dry Grey Goose martini. Several of his guests are having the same.
OBAMA: So, gentlemen. Youve built some of the most successful companies of the digital age. Billions of people use your products, and youve all made billions as a result. I know I am the poor boy at this table, though with Bill here our average net wealth is much higher than it would otherwise be. <Everyone laughs.> Ive asked you to dinner tonight so we can brainstorm about something bigger and more important than making money, which is the health of our democracy. How can tech help? I mean, barely more than 55% of Americans are going to vote this year. Most people cant even name their own representative in Congress. Like I said about long voting lineswe have to fix that. I want your best ideas.
SCHMIDT: Barack, in my view, pretty soon this wont be a problem any more. Artificial intelligence is going to take care of it. Were heading toward an amazing world where smart machines will do almost everything for us. As I wrote in my book, The New Digital Age, soon we will have information systems that will streamline many of lifes small daily tasks, such as integrated clothing machines (washing, drying, folding, pressing and sorting) that keep an inventory of clean clothes and algorithmically suggest outfits based on the users daily schedule. Haircuts will finally be automated and machine-precise. Its right there in my book. And...
HOFFMAN: Oh, cmon Eric, is that what explains why your hair looks like it was cut by a robot? Who picked out that shirt for you? Just kidding, I know Im hardly the worlds best dresser.
ZUCKERBERG: Wait, you mean I didnt have to wear a suit and tie for this?
HOFFMAN: With all due respect, Eric, this isnt going to be solved by artificial intelligence. We can revive political participation by teaching politicians to maximize how networked they are. If you cant conceptualize and understand networks, you will lose out to others in todays fast-paced and hyper-competitive landscape. You have to use your Facebook profile or your LinkedIn profile as more than a digital resumepoliticians just have to use phrases and keywords with deliberate intention, to maximize your discoverability by the kinds of people you want to be found by. 
OBAMA: Im sorry, but how does that increase voter turnout or civic engagement?
HOFFMAN: Well, the more network-savvy you are, the more you can influence others to get out to vote. Who retweets you? Who comments on your Medium posts? Who shows up on LinkedIn as a first degree connection? Dont forget, you once had 13 million people on your email list.
OBAMA: Im afraid Im not following you.
ZUCKERBERG: I see what you did there, Mr. President. <Everyone laughs.> But seriously, before we talk about being networked like Reid, what we need to do is make sure everyone is connected. Dont forget, even here in the United States, not everyone is online. The Internet isnt affordable to everyone, and in many places awareness of its value remains low. Thats why we want to bring Internet.org, our Free Basics service, to every American. 
OBAMA: I thought that was just for people in the developing world.
ZUCKERBERG: Have you been to some parts of America? Seriously, if you want to increase voter turnout and civic engagement, we have to make sure first everyone is online. With Internet.org, were giving people with smartphones free access to all that Facebook has to offer. If someone cant afford to pay for connectivity, it is always better to have some access than none at all.
OBAMA: Let me see if I understand. Its sort of like saying if someone cant afford a quality private education at Harvard, we should at least give them access to community college? Or is the idea that if they live in a poor city that cant afford to pay for clean water, we at least let them drink from the river? Im not sure I understand...
KALANICK: Actually, what Mark is doing is backwards. Instead of charging people less for a basic service, we should offer them a premium service for more. If you want shorter lines on Election Day, you should set up different lines depending on how much people are willing to pay for the convenience. I dont see why I should have to wait in line with everyone else. 
OBAMA: (Starting to smirk) So you would have something like a VoterX line for regular folks, VoterSelect for people who want a faster line, VoterBlack for people who dont want to stand in line at all? You might want to rename VoterBlack to VoterWhite in that case...
KALANICK: (Oblivious to Obamas joke) Yeah, that would be really baller. And if lines are too long, just implement surge pricing. Some people who want to will pay the higher price to skip the line and others will just choose to come back later, when the lines are shorter again.
PINCUS: Thats ridiculous Travis. You cant set up a fast-lane and a slow-lane for polling stations. Mr. President
OBAMA: By the way, Mark, thank you for contributing to my SuperPAC back in 2012. Much appreciated. Not everyone else here was as generous as you.
PINCUS: (Grinning). I think the problem with getting more people to vote and be civically engaged is that its just not very fun. Lets give people points for showing up at their local public hearing, or for volunteering in their kids school. Call it Civic With Friends.
OBAMA: You mean, we should gamify politics? Dont people feel like its a game already, just not one they can afford to play in? I mean, for example, shouldnt we end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around? And, besides, how would you keep track of whether someone earned their civic points?
PINCUS: Well, if enough people banded together, like with Kickstarter, they could literally buy the presidency. A million people give a thousand dollars apiece. I believe theres a million people whod like to give a fuck you to both political parties. Im mean, look at the game Star Citizenpeople raised $80 million.
ZUCKERBERG: (Interjecting)...We have a lot of that kind of social graph information already on Facebook, actually. Look, if we just put a button on peoples pages saying I Voted and show them pictures of their friends saying the same thing, we can get more people to vote. Weve upped turnout by a couple of percentage points.
KALANICK: (Turning to ZUCKERBERG) Plouffe never mentioned that to mecan we buy that service from you? There are some mayors were having problems with...
OBAMA: Hold on, hold on, hold on! All Im hearing from you is a bunch of pitches for your products, and nothing about how we can actually help people vote or get involved in politics. Dont you have any practical ideas on how we can get more people registered? Or how we can involve people in public meetings so they arent so painful? Or make sure that the people in positions of authority listen? Or do you all just think thats the job of government?
HOFFMAN: The President is right...we need to help government figure this out.
EVERYONE ELSE AT ONCE: Oh, no, we dont believe the government knows how to do anything right, including how to make our democracy work better.
OBAMA: (To his butler)...Please make me another martini. Make it a strong one. Get me the iPad the NSA doesnt know I have. And, on second thought, bring me a cigarette too. Dont tell Michelle...
END SCENE.

This is civic tech: Building on earlier writing (including work he did for techPresident and republished in our book A Lever and a Place to Stand), Matt Leighninger of the Deliberative Democracy Consortium suggests some key goals for the civic tech field. He writes:
To make our democracies more participatory, energetic, efficient and equitable, we should take stock of how civic tech can be part of an overhaul of our whole civic infrastructure. How can online tools help revitalize face-to-face meetings? How can online forums help sustain social and political connections among large numbers of people? How can we give more people  especially those who face barriers related to education, language and economic stability  the skills and support they need to participate effectively, online or off?

Franchesca Ramsey asks a question about police violence at the Jan. 17 Democratic debate  NBC News / YouTube
In 2007, televised presidential debates reached a new milestone: CNN included questions from the public submitted via YouTube.
Were out there to actually see how people who want to be president think and handle issues and questions and people that are slightly outside of their comfort zones, David Bohrman, then-CNNs senior vice president, said at the time.
The move was both welcomed as a step in the right direction and criticized for not going far enough, as it was still up to CNN to determine which questions would be posed to the candidates. Four years later, when Fox News teamed up with Google in 2011 during the primary debates to gather questions from the public, users voted up their favorite submissions for Fox to consider, another small step.
But a year later, despite the Commission on Presidential Debates announcing a digital coalition with Google, AOL, and Yahoo to engage the public, there was no guarantee that questions submitted online would be used during the 2012 presidential debates.
Fast forward to 2016, and the media is still figuring out how to push candidates beyond their comfort zone while also remaining an editorial gatekeeper and profitable debate partner. The difference, as we saw this past Sunday during the NBC News-YouTube Democratic debate in South Carolina, is that questions are now being asked by members of the public with social media followings and audiences that rival those of major media companies. 
The last Democratic debate before the Iowa caucus included questions from four YouTube creators: writer/actor Franchesca Ramsey (220,000+ subscribers), author and lifestyle entrepreneur Connor Franta (5.2 million+ subscribers), tech reviewer Marques Brownlee (3.1 million+ subscribers) and MinuteEarth (1.2 million+ subscribers), a group channel that creates animated videos about science and environmental issues. 
Steve Grove, director of Google News Lab, said this week that the first debate involving YouTube in 2007 was not necessarily as democratic as it could have been, because CNN ended up choosing the questions, but we thought it was a great step forward for getting voices from outside of the Beltway reporter class into these discussions.
Now, the goal is not only to include new voices but to bring in new audiences as well.
Power to the PeopleAnd the Content Creators
One of the phenomena weve seen evolve over the past five or six years, said Grove, is the strength and power of online YouTube creators to really marshal extraordinary audiences on their channels, and who can bring new people into political discussions if they themselves get politically involved.
So instead of looking for well-known creators who cover big-P politics, Grove said YouTube and NBC sought to include creators with interests relevant to debate questions who could also bring an audience that might not otherwise pay attention. 
Diversity, along with audience size, was a key consideration, especially with the debate taking place near the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where a young white shooter killed nine black worshippers in June 2015. Google worked with NBC to compile a list of potential YouTube creators to choose from, with NBC making the final call.
The debate was watched by 12.5 million viewers across all platforms, including 10.2 million who watched live on NBC. It was the second most-watched of the Democratic debates and the only debate of this election cycle so far to livestream on a networks YouTube channel, among other digital platforms. 
The decision to work mostly with creators who are up on current political topics led to questions that reflected a sophisticated understanding of the issues. That has not always been the case, in part because the media tends to pick more strategy-driven questions. 
Ramsey, who often blends social commentary with comedy, particularly around race and LGBT issues, asked one of the most pointed questions of the night: 

I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities. For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice werent indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?

Debate moderator Lester Holt, host of NBC Nightly News, directed the question to Sen. Bernie Sanders. He responded with specifics: 

This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney generals investigation. Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard-working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear. If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable. 
 And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they dont look like occupying armies. Weve got to move toward community policing. And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.

As to the first point, Aaron Blake of the Washington Post called Sanders response a concrete proposal on a question that usually leads to platitudes, and his colleague Janell Ross wrote, Many people and organizationsnamely police unionsdo not agree with this idea. But, its noteworthy that Sanders offered up a specific policy/practice reform that if elected, his administration would advance. In response to Sanders third point about demilitarization,
In response to Sanders third point about demilitarization, Ross offered more commentary and links for further reading. These comments, and others, appear in the Posts annotated debate transcripta terrific feature.
During a post-debate interview with MSNBC, Ramsey praised Sanders response, yet added she was disappointed the question was not addressed to other candidates. She made the same point in the comments on her video. Asked why the question of police violence was of importance to her, Ramsey referenced Sandra Bland and said:

I worry at times that doing the right things and being law-abiding citizens really isnt enough if we live in a country where unfortunately people of color and black people are criminalized and seen as a threat, and then our lives are not taken seriously when and if something happens.

Of course, good questions do not guarantee nuanced responses. Brownlees question about encryption technology and privacy vs. security failed to elicit the sort of conversation one might have hoped for. Time magazines Haley Sweetland Edwards wrote that none of the candidates appeared to understand the controversy over encryption technology that, in recent months, has pitted top national-security officials against the CEOs of Silicon Valleys biggest tech firms. 
MinuteEarths video about climate change and Americas energy future sparked more digs against Republican presidential candidates than detailed discussion, but it wasnt MinuteEarths fault; the candidates werent pushed on the issue. Still, the video, along with the candidates responses, has attracted more than 171,000 views on MinuteEarths YouTube channel. 
Viewers can also watch an alternative video on greenhouse gasses that MinuteEarth said it created at NBCs request, in case the candidates had already addressed the first question. That video has received more than 137,000 views since being posted Jan. 19.
Franta, 23, who has the most subscribers among those selected, raised a question about reaching out to younger voters. (Note to all candidates: A tweet from Franta encouraging his followers to watch the debate was retweeted more than 2,800 times.)
I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, Franta asked, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?
It was the least political question asked by any of the YouTube creators, but Holt directed it only to Clinton (who led off by congratulating Fanta on his 5 million viewers). As if the horse-race aspect Holt set up wasnt already clear, he included a follow-up: Why is Sen. Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?
The Candidates, Now Trending
Throughout the debate, Google provided snapshots of search trendssuch as a graphic showing a 175-percent increase between 2004 and 2016 for how to fix Washingtonalong with real-time updates of trending (or spiking) questions about each candidate and the top-searched issues. (Google today announced its teaming up with Fox News for the next Republican debate on Jan. 28. and will integrate these same tools.)
You can still view data for the most-searched candidate by county, and follow search interest in candidates for each minute of the debate: 
// <![CDATA[
trends.embed.renderWidget("US_cu_LVTAMlIBAAC_5M_en", "fe_line_chart_53d7e80d-ef34-4aa5-9371-90386a9c3b9e", {});
// ]]&gt;
Moderator Lester Holt at one point noted that Google searches for black lives matter had surpassed searches for civil rights movement in 2015 and had become the top trending political issue in South Carolina. 
Search trends over time are obviously useful to both the candidates and the media, said Grove. The data can also help voters understand which topics matter most to people in their state or across the country.
I think the unique thing about Google Search is that it is an unvarnished look at the curiosities of people, said Grove, and were able to anonymize and aggregate that data. These are not public social media posts that are a sort of manicured version of what you want people to think you care aboutthis is what youre actually curious about.
During a post-debate interview with MSNBCs Chuck Todd, Daniel Sieberg, global head of media outreach at Google News Lab, noted that Sanders was the most searched-for candidate during the debate, but it was impossible to know if the searches reflected positive or negative attitudes. Goldman Sachs spiked around 10 p.m. when Sanders referenced big banks, and there was a lot of interest around Iran, healthcare, and gun control.
The real-time data not only highlights the types of issues that spark interest, but it also shows that debate viewers are doing more than just watchingtheyre researching. Grove said that gives him hope that people really do care about the issues, even though were conditioned to think elections are built on controversy and conflict.  
Live from the White House
Two days before the Democratic debate, another trio of young YouTube creatorsDestin Sandlin, Ingrid Nilsen, and Adande Thorneinterviewed President Obama. The video posted to the White House YouTube channel has been viewed more than 1.2 million times in six days.
The wide-ranging discussion, which streamed live, drew on both the personal and the political, from terrorism to Kendrick Lamars new album and the luxury tax on menstrual products. The young interviewers followed their passions, drawing Obama into lively and occasionally poignant conversations. While theres some overlap with issues that are part of the national discussion, theres also a refreshing unconventionality.
The press corps that follows the president and follows the election has a very important role, because they have all the context and know what happens every single day in the campaign, and they can leverage that accumulated knowledge to ask important questions, said Grove. The flip-side, of course, is that outsiders arent bound to those same conventions.
This marks the seventhand likely the finalYouTube interview at the White House with Obama. The video kicks off with a historical review, hosted by Grove, that reveals how much technology has changed and, with it, our expectations for access and authenticity. In 2010, it was the top-voted video questions. In 2012, it was Google Hangouts. In 2016, its #YouTubeAsksObama, with famous creators assuming the role of the press.
The same is true, kind of, on the campaign trail. Grove noted that YouTube creator GloZell Green interviewed Clinton last month (Green also interviewed Obama at the White House in January 2015), and he predicted that well see more YouTube interviews throughout the election cycle.
These creators have enormous audiencesaudiences, many times, that dwarf those of cable news stations. So a hit with a Swoozie or an Ingrid or a Destin can be, in some ways, even more valuable than a hit on cable news, said Grove.
If youre a candidate in todays political environment, youd be smart to pay attention to it, he added, because its a real opportunity to engage with a whole new audience, often times a younger audience, around topics that matter to them.
And who knows better than a YouTube creator how to thank fans and draw attention.

This is civic tech: News from Datamades Derek Eder: Chicago Councilmatic has just relaunched, tracking all things related to the Chicago City Council, joining its cousin NYC Councilmatic.


GovTech.com and Dustin Haisler and Paul Taylor of e.Republic have put together the GovTech100, a list of 100 companies focused on servicing government customers, having developed an innovative or disruptive offering to improve or transform government, or having created new models for delivering services. These companies are active in one or more market segments: administrative, service delivery, intelligent infrastructure and civic tech focus areas.


DemocracyOS, the open-source deliberation platform that originated in Argentina, has a posse in France, as Virgil Deville describes.


93 percent of 89 U.S. mayors from 31 states surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual Menino survey say they are in favor of police wearing body cameras.


Asked about infrastructure needs for their cities, these mayors identified roads, mass transit, and water/wastewater/stormwater as their top priorities were they to get an unrestricted grant to pay for a large project. Broadband was at the bottom of their lists. (The word technology never appears in the full report.)


Asked what three cities these mayors had recently looked to for policy ideas, the top three responses were, in order, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. (h/t NY city councilman Brad Lander)


Privacy watch: Speaking of our inspiring city, really high-speed free Wi-Fi is coming to New York City via the new LinkNYC network being built by the CityBridge consortium, and while the networks speed and availability is going to surprise a lot of users, the Wall Street Journals Joanna Stern warns that you better take some common-sense steps to secure your communications before you join in the party.


Related: Privacy expert Julia Angwin of ProPublica offers her guide to improving your internet security.


Further related: If you are worried about the data that Google and Facebook may be collecting from you, Brian Fung of the Washington Post reports consumer privacy groups are even more worried about the data that your internet service providerVerizon, AT&T, Comcast most likelyis collecting.


Jenna McLaughlin explains in The Intercept why the White Houses recent request of major social network companies like Facebook that they use their algorithms for spotting terrorist content online is highly unlikely to work. The main problem: acts of terror are exceedingly rare. She writes, Many experts, including people with law enforcement, academic, and scientific backgrounds, agree that its practically impossible to boil down the essential predictive markers that make up a terrorist who is willing and capable of carrying out an attack and then successfully pick him out of a crowd.


What sharing economy?: A Pennsylvania State University study funded by the hotel industry found that 39 percent of all the revenue generated by Airbnb guests in 12 major metropolitan areas over a thirteen month period in 2014-15 went to landlords operating more than one unit, Patrick Clark reports for Bloomberg Business.


Diversity blues: Silicon Valley companies say they want to hire more blacks, but as Vauhini Vara reports for Bloomberg Business, getting young coders from an elite historically black college like Howard University jobs at major tech firms is a lot more complicated.

It feels as if we cant escape the culture of fear and extremism that is pervading politics. Political discourse is more vitriolic than ever after San Bernardino and Paris, and during the months of partisan name-calling and ugly mud-slinging among candidates for the U.S. Presidential Race. And clearly, there are no easy solutions to unraveling this vicious cycle.
During the Christmas holiday, I had an experience that perfectly illustrated this to me. My family and I were at a friends house for a holiday event, and I overheard her guests talking as I walked through the kitchen. I heard, The more he says, the more I like him. Then, He says the things we all think but are afraid to say. I started to get that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, hoping they werent talking about Donald Trump. Then I heard, The only problem with building a wall between Mexico and the U.S. is that it will have to be so big that its impractical and expensive. I tried to talk myself off the ledge, saying to myself, Dont open your mouth, just keep walking, dont say anything, it wont help or change anyones mind..... But then as I was about to turn the corner, safely avoiding a conversation that would surely have turned ugly, I heard, Of course we should ban Muslims from entering the country. Look what they did in Paris. So, I turned sharply on my heel and unwisely marched over to the little group sitting around the kitchen table.
Excuse me, I said, but I couldnt help but overhear your conversation, and I wish that you would consider the fact that excluding or persecuting people solely on the basis of their religion or ethnicity is how (voice rising) the Holocaust started. And then, when the response to that grenade lob was dropped jaws and the explanation, It would only be temporary, I looked at them incredulously, probably with disgust on my face, and said, Thats what Hitler said and just in case they didnt get it the first time, thats how the Holocaust started. Then I abruptly left, muttering, This was a mistake, I cant talk about this.....
I found this conversation terrifyingnot only because the thought of Trump as President is terrifying, nor because I was disappointed in myself because I lost my cool, and created an extreme, unbridgeable divide between our viewpoints by invoking the Holocaust. No, this conversation was most terrifying because these people were not bad people. They were the type of people I appreciate: good, kind, hard-working people who love their kids and their family.
So where does that leave us?
I dont have a solution, and indeed, my own extreme reaction during the kitchen table conversation shows that I lack objectivity and am certainly part of the problem. I do, however, as a scientist believe that we can harness what we know about our minds and brains to neutralize this vicious cycle of social and political extremism. Could digital disruption help move us along a path to such change? There might not be an app for that, but below I list three steps I believe could put us on the road towards digital disruption of the political culture of fear.
1. Frame political extremism as an emotion regulation problem. Before any digital disruption can happen, we have to make sense of the problem and have a concept of whats going wrong. We have all had one of those kitchen table conversations I described above. In these conversations, our emotions get the better of us: fear, disgust, anger. This is a problem in how we control our emotions and how our emotions control our thoughts, decisions, and actions, something psychologists call emotion regulation. The problem is that our strong emotions rarely convince our debating partners. Instead, they solidify the views everyone already holds, causing us to cling to them even more strongly and rigidly. Common ground is lost, and the divide between perspectives seems increasingly unbridgeable.
Imagine how a version of that kitchen table conversation happens on the political world stage, sabotaging attempts at diplomacy and mutual understanding. The result is not just upset and angry people. Now the result is that our emotions directly shape political discourse, legal decisions, and policies that can affect generations to come.
Thus, a first crucial step towards disruption of the political culture of fear is to frame political discourse in terms of emotion regulation, applying what we know about what goes wrong and how to fix it on the individual and group level.
2. Use technology to promote empathy. Recent research in political psychology suggests that empathy can help heal rancorous political divides. A recently-published study showed that when political advocates fail to understand the values of those they wish to persuade, this moral empathy gap causes their arguments to fail. However, when political arguments are reframed in the moral terms of the other side, they are more effective. For example, when asked about their views on universal healthcare, conservatives who heard purity arguments (e.g., sick people are disgusting and therefore we need to reduce sickness) were friendlier towards universal healthcare, compared to when they heard fairness arguments, which are more consistent with liberal values.
If we can use technology to bridge the moral empathy gap, we might be able to reduce political polarization and promote better emotion regulation, more compromise, and deepened understanding. Virtual Reality (VR) might be one such technology. I previously wrote about Chris Milks thought-provoking TED talk on VR as the ultimate empathy machine. By creating a sense of presence and of real interactions with people and worlds, VR forges empathic bridges leading to greater understanding and compassion. In his work with the UN, Chris Milk uses VR to vividly portray the plight of refugees to politicians and policy makers. How does seeing and experiencing the suffering of 5-year-old children in the refugee camps influence policy making? Almost certainly for the better.
3. Use technology to calm the fearful brain. As political ideologies become increasingly polarized, neuroscience research suggests that the differences between liberal and conservative viewpoints may extend beyond policy preferences to fundamental differences in the fearful brain.
In a paper I wrote in 2014 with Dave Amodio, a professor at NYU, we found that children of liberal compared to conservative parents showed a stronger N2 brain response to mildly threatening and conflicting information. A greater N2, derived from EEG, suggests more openness to uncertainty, ambiguity, and threat. A culture of fear, in politics or otherwise, is marked by the opposite of this: inflexibility and discomfort in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity, along with resistance to change. These aspects of fear are part of the foundation upon which intolerance is built.
What if we could create computerized interventions that promote our ability to cope with uncertainty and change, perhaps by strengthening the N2 response? My research on the stress reduction app Personal Zen, as well as other research, shows that this may be possible. More research is needed, but if science-driven digital mental health continues to evolve, reducing the political culture of fear could soon be in the palm of our hand.

This is civic tech: Longtime civic hacker Luke Fretwell (founder of the GovFresh blog) announces the launch of Proud City, focusing on delivering open, responsive digital services for cities.


Microsoft is donating $1 billion in cloud services to nonprofits and university researchers over the next three years, its president and chief legal officer Brad Smith writes. Our goal is to support 70,000 nonprofits through this initiative during that time, he says. The effort is a founding initiative of Microsoft Philanthropies, launched last month.


Jason Tashea shares with Civicist some of the key findings from a report he recently completed for John Jay College of Criminal Justice on the current state of criminal justice tech and how to support and grow this ecosystem.


Lorelei Kelly argues that better civic tech, in the form of tools and platforms that allow for greater citizen participation in lawmaking, could help route around the future disputes like the one now roiling Oregons Harney County land occupation. (Something tells me the militia men who think they have the sole authority to interpret the Constitution might not buy into that, but we still could use much better processes for public engagement in lawmaking than the ones we have now.)


USC professor Henry Jenkins, who has long argued for the civic value of popular culture, posts a long, two-part dialogue with Tracy van Slyke, founder of the Culture Lab. Part one focuses on her 2014 report Spoiler Alert. Part two looks at how both progressives and conservatives are focusing on using culture to shift political narratives.


Some apps for helping victims of sexual assault are useful, like Circle of Six, which sends an urgent help message to six contacts with a single tap. And others, like a new batch from a company called We-Consent, are positively awful, writes Nora Caplan-Bricker for Slate.


The U.S. Census Bureau is embracing open source, FlowingDatas Nathan Yau reports.


The Points of Light CivicX Accelerator is accepting applications now for its Spring 2016 cohort.

San Franciscos Office of Civic Innovation is looking for two new 2016 Mayors Innovation Fellows and the deadline to apply is February 2.


Tech and the presidentials: Some of the emails housed on Hillary Clintons home server while she was Secretary of State contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a higher level than previously reported, according to a letter to Congress from the intelligence communitys inspector general, NBC News Ken Dilanian reports.


Wired magazines editors came up with a list of the 20 tech insiders having the greatest influence on the 2016 campaign. While many of the people named definitely are players in the political tech sector (oddly missing: the team from Revolution Messaging that is powering Bernie Sanders internal tech), Wired cant help but puff them beyond recognition. Its a silly, silly exercise, starting with this disconnected-from-reality statement: 2016 is the election when Silicon Valleyits players, its policy priorities, and, oh yes, its moneyfinally upstages the old 20th-century power structure and seizes control of the political game. (So that means the top candidates are all in favor of liberalizing immigration policy and strong encryption, right, like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz?) Also, the nature of power itself is changing, Wired claims, citing the example of Mark Zuckerberg throwing his Mandarin skills to impress the authoritarian regime in Beijing and promising to use his fortune to rethink society. Gosh, that sounds like the nature of power hasnt changed at all, Wired editors!


Crypto wars, continued: A U.K. court of appeal has ruled that the detention of David Miranda, Glenn Greenwalds partner, under the Terrorism Act, violated his rights as a journalist, Trevor Timm writes for The Guardian. Miranda had been stopped at Heathrow and detained and interrogated for nine hours without a lawyer after visiting Laura Poitras in Germany, assisting their reporting for the Guardian on the NSA.


Life in Facebookistan: Indias internet regulator has rebuked Facebook for its heavy-handed effort to get its users there to support its controversial Free Basics program, telling the company, Your urging has the flavor of reducing this meaningful consultative exercise designed to produce informed decisions in a transparent manner into a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll. Among other things, it criticized the company for claiming to speak on behalf of users it had prompted to lobby the regulator via nudges on its platform, Rohan Venkataramakrishnan reports for Scroll.in.


Meanwhile in Myanmar, internet usage has exploded from less than one percent in 2009 and 7 percent in 2012 to 62 percent now. And as David Madden of the Phandeeyar Innovation Lab tells Erik Crouch of TechinAsia, Facebook is the internet there. For millions of people, Facebook has become the go-to site for news, discussion, and debate, he says. Publishers will often post news updates and picture stories straight to Facebook, with no link to the homepage, adds Poppy McPherson of the Coconuts Yango website.


I know what you wore last summer: Fitting rooms are going high-tech, reports Kim Bhasin for Bloomberg Business, and this little fact, buried in her otherwise helpful story about improving the clothes shopping experience, may give you pause: In a partnership with eBay, Rebecca Minkoff stores are testing rooms that let patrons flip through lighting templates to show what they look like in the office, on the street, or at a club. Through radio-frequency identification tagging, screens know what clothing is being tried on and display different colors and sizes. Caveat emptor: It isnt just screens that know what clothing is being tried on. This brings new meaning to tag sales.

Technology is creating new opportunities for improvement and reform of the criminal justice system.
In Arizona, a county court created a web and video accessible kiosk where individuals can appear in court 70 miles away. Around the country, the ACLU released apps to crowdsource police oversight. And in Chicago, there is a new visualization showing the financial impact of mass incarceration.
These are just three of the more than 50 projects surveyed in a new reportreleased todaywhich I wrote for the Research and Evaluation Center at John Jay College. The report, Emerging Justice Technologies and the Need for Evaluation, accomplishes three things. First, it introduces justice stakeholders, such as police, corrections, reform advocates, and court officials, to the larger trends of government and civic technology that are behind these new projects. Second, it surveys new criminal justice projects and platforms that aim to improve system efficacy, crowdsource information, and collect and visualize data. Last, it makes five recommendations to better nurture the understanding, creation, and implementation of emerging justice technologies.
The surveyed projects are exciting, innovative, and many hold promise to increase fairness, efficacy, and comprehension of the criminal justice system. However, unlike building a tool to find a cab or a restaurant, technology affecting criminal justice requires more stringent assessment. The criminal justice system is the greatest point of control the government can have over an individual, so the need to get it right is paramount. Therefore, the technologies that compliment or supplant aspects of this system raise unique questions that require a high level of scrutiny and validation.
Currently, however, critical questions about these new technologies go unanswered. For example, do platforms collecting detailed information about those on community release increase re-arrest rates? Can new technologies compound already present racial bias? Regarding user experience, are projects accounting for those with developmental disabilities, a significant cohort in the criminal justice system?
For a number of reasons, technological advancement outpaces the capacity to answer questions like these. First, research for this report revealed that while individual projects exist, there is no centralized organization or university initiative focused on researching these new technologies. Second, the organizations creating many of the tools in this report are not in the business of research or validation. Third, this area of criminal justice is still new, which means limited attention and funding. Together, these hurdles mean that we run the risk of iterating projects without first understanding efficacy and potential negative, unintended consequences.
With this in mind, the Research and Evaluation Center is moving forward with the reports five recommendations to support civic technology and criminal justice organizations to verify and improve the impact of their work.
First, the Research and Evaluation Center will build an initiative that brings together leaders from the criminal justice and technology fields. This will be a venue to convene experts and foster open dialogue about how technology can alleviate the myriad of issues confronting criminal justice. Creating this community will allow criminal justice and technology professionals to learn from each other while promoting new ideas and projects.
Second, once this initiative is created it can begin to identify emerging and best practices through research and evaluation. This research can create a path towards validating practices that will be shared openly among government leaders, technologists, and reformers to improve creation and implementation of projects.
Third, as a result of this work, a cadre of professionals will be created to span the worlds of criminal justice and tech. These individuals will be valuable for their capacity to understand complex criminal justice systems and technology and their ability to translate for those on either side of the criminal justice-technology spectrum.
Fourth, this initiative will be inclusive and incorporate previously incarcerated persons and communities that are acutely impacted by the criminal justice system. Those affected by the criminal justice system possess invaluable lived experience that will improve user experience, project development, and user adoption. Last, this work will be used to educate the public on technologys role in criminal justice and reform.
Collectively, justice stakeholders, reformers, and those affected by the justice system will benefit from a unified home for emerging justice technologies. However, the bar for success cannot merely be the deployment of a new technology; it must be data driven and informed by the best research. To do otherwise will impede technologys increasing role in a fairer and more just criminal justice system.

The annual Burson-Marsteller Twiplomacy study is expanding this year to include other platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Yesterday, they released the the first installment, which covers the use of Facebook by world leaders and their governments.


The report is as full and detailed as ever, even if judging governments and leaders by their social media presence has its limits. (I, for example, would rather judge my presidents effectiveness by something other than Facebook interactions.) Burson-Marsteller found that Barack Obama and Indias Narendra Modi were the Most Liked world leaders, as determined by the number of page likes. Argentinas new President Mauricio Macri was found to be the Most Engaged, with the highest interactions to fan ratio, followed by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Israels Benjamin Netanyahu. Narendra Modi and Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan topped the list of Most Effective world leaders, meaning that they had the highest average number of interactions per post.


I reached out to Burson-Marsteller to ask about bots and whether evidence of bot activity was found or taken into consideration in the results, and a representative replied, We did see some strange activity on one or two accounts but we cannot say for certain whether this was due to bots or if the organisation simply paid to promote the account or the posts with Facebook ads. Since Facebook will not release that information we decided not to mention this. According to the press release, additional installments to the 2016 Twiplomacy study will be released each month until the full study is published in May.

Civic Hall v2.0?: Earlier this month, Torontos Government Management Committee was asked to consider opportunities for the creation of a Toronto-based Civic Hall, based on the civic model which has been developed in New York City (thats us!).

And it is on all of us to see it through. There is only us, the people. And if we truly value solidarity at this company it is a good time to recognize, and remember, and recommit to standing with the people who lost their livelihoods, their limbs, and even their lives, merely asking for something as simple and basic and obvious as equal rights and equal protections under the law. Its quite a statement.

We are pleased to welcome Tom Steinberg as Civicists new senior contributing editor. Drawing on more than a decade of unique experience as the founding director of the United Kingdoms mySociety.org and adviser to several British governments, he will be writing regularly for Civicist on current issues in the civic tech arena.
In my early 20s I worked in a government office that had a variety of thought-provoking statements printed on the walls. They were of a rather higher standard than the usual motivational platitudes, and a couple have remained knocking around my head into my 30s.
One was a quote from Pablo Picasso. It read:
Computers are useless, they can give you only answers.

Being much more techy than most of my civil servant colleagues I initially took this as typical prejudice by non-geeks against their technically-minded cousins. But as I grew older and I read much more about the history of science and innovation, I came to understand what Picasso was getting at: that the most impressive people are often successful because they ask the right questions at the right time.
Recently this idea popped back into my mind as I was reading and then watching a famous speech by the mathematician and computer science pioneer Richard HammingYou and Your Research. In his speech he dwells extensively on the importance of working on important problems, which he explains in this wonderfully lucid way:
Let me warn you, important problem must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didnt work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. Its not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important.

Inspired by this I took a bit of time over the holidays to think about what some contenders for the important problems in civic technology might be, at the moment. Caveat, Reader: these are really stabs in the dark.
The next time that a nation does a major post-crisis constitutional overhaul (think Ukraine or Cuba or Syria in the not-too-distant future) are there any digital ideas so significant that they should actually feature in the new constitution itself?
If, as has been frequently claimed, the affordances of digital technologies really do alter the possible nature of government and politics, we should expect to see important new ideas embedded in 21st century constitutions. But what are the digital ideas we might expect to see debated by constitutional drafting committees? What issues and principles are sufficiently-new, but also long-term, that they belong in these hard-to-change and critical documents? Do any new ideas actually merit inclusion, or has the world simply not changed that much after all?
Can the civic tech movement have any detectable impact on the level of openness and accountability of governments?
One of the things that excited me about civic tech from the very start was the possibility of smuggling public interest values into public service provision, disguised under the cloak of code and design choices. I believed that the moment where an offline digital service (or a rubbishy first generation online service) was replaced by a better one could be a moment where new levels of openness and accountability could be embedded in the day to day business of government.
You can see this in some of the design decisions that I drove in early mySociety products. FixMyStreet makes reporting problems much easier, but it also makes the status of those problems public. The ease of use drove traffic, which automatically led to more transparency over fault reporting, which was supposed to shift expectations about what a normal level of transparency was.
What preoccupies me now is the question of whether this embedding of transparency and accountability values hard into the code of digital public services is going to be widespread or not. It is entirely possible to make a service more usable without making it any more transparent. Was it naive to assume we could smuggle in a bit of better governance through the back-door of software supply? Or is this actually happening quite often?
What will it take for governments to create new public digital institutions that are about issues other than surveillance and security?
In Germany the post-war government created the BPB, a federal agency designed to give rigorously non-partisan information to prospective voters. It runs the truly huge Wahl-o-mat, the Who should I vote for? website that trumps all others internationally in terms of reach and significance. The BPB is highly respected and widely trusted as being non-partisan: it has no parallel in the U.S. or the U.K.
This institution exists to keep Germany workingto keep it successful, peaceful, and prosperous. It is an example of an innovative public institution that doesnt do anything as traditional as running schools or hospitals.
Ive written repeatedly that I think well see new public institutions emerge that have digital ideas at the core. The question is, where are they going to come from, and what confluence of events will precede them?
How do governments get good at providing digital services on a widespread basis?
The already-huge gap between the quality of digital services delivered by the private sector and the public sector is, with a few notable exceptions, widening every day. This ever-growing gulf threatens the very legitimacy of government as an idea.
Despite this threat nibbling away at the base of the social contract, most governments clearly see their digital service provision as good enough and not a significant enough problem to justify any significant reorganisations of staff, power, budgets, or priorities.
This problem is particularly acute at the level of local government, where theres a basic discrepancy between the cost of building good quality digital services, and the small size of the tax base.
So the important problem here is working out ways that governments can catch up in a scaleable, repeatable way, before its too late.
What kinds of civic features can the internet giants offer, and what will induce them to deliver?
There was no concept of the emergency telephone service 999 (or 911 for American readers) before there were telephone networks. But these days the provision of this civic feature is so key that it is a critical determinant of whether a service even officially counts as telephony or not. Television and radio brought with them public service concepts of adult-content watersheds, public service announcements, nuclear attack warnings, and a range of other civic features that were largely incidental to the bottom lines of the companies.
What are the equivalents going to be for the biggest, most mainstream digital apps? And through what processes will they arrive?
Your turn, Reader
Im not really sure that any of the above definitely counts as an important problem. But I hope by writing this that readers will perhaps suggest their own ideas, or changes to what Ive written that would get us closer to something significant. I look forward to seeing your ideas.

Civic Tech 





The proposed bill in New York to require state smartphone vendors to sell only phones that can be decrypted or unlocked by the manufacturer or OS provider has had one unexpected boon: it has drawn New Yorkers attention to, and even generated excitement about, the NYSenate.gov relaunch (which I wrote about last October) and how New Yorkers can use it to express support (aye) or rejection (nay) of proposed legislation, as Zack Whittaker has encouraged ZDNet readers to do.


For the Chicago Tribunes innovation vertical, Amina Elahi reports that Chicagos civic tech scene has in many ways stalled, which Smart Chicago Collaboratives Dan ONeil attributes to a disconnect between activists in the street and civic technologists. This extends to campaign tech, too: There may not be a game-changer in political technology this election cycle as campaigns lean on the widely available and affordable data analytics tools and techniques pioneered by Obamas campaigns in 2008 and 2012, Elahi concludes.


I Quant NYs Ben Wellington crunched the numbers again and found that 28 percent of New York City is not patrolled by the closest precinct house. Reasons that might matter? First of all, it would perhaps make reporting crimes easier, because the logical place to go would be the closest precinct house. Then, Wellington also wonders whether centrally-located precinct houses could improve community-police relations.


Data visualization company 1point21 Interactive has created a map that clearly shows the 6 to 1 ratio of gun dealers to Starbucks in the United States, Tanvi Misra writes for CityLab. Gun sellers (64,747 licensed as of December 2015) even outnumber the total number of coffee shops in the U.S. (55,246 in 2016).


There were multiple explosions in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday, but Facebook did not deploy its safety check feature, Nadine Freischlad reports for Tech in Asia. Following terrorist attacks in Paris and Beirut, Lebanon, last year, Facebook was criticized for activating the feature for the former but not the latter, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that they would activate it for more human disasters in the future.


The Twitter Government and Elections team last night tweeted that Trump dominated 38 percent of the #GOPDebate conversation, a hefty lead over Cruz, at 22 percent, Bush at 11 percent, Rubio at 10 percent, and Carson at 9 percent.


Speaking of Twitter, over at Motherboard, Sarah Jeong has written a thorough and fairly engrossing history of Twitters Rules, from the first 568 to the now 1,334, and all the little additions and subtractions in between. She concludes, in part: In a way, things were easier when Twitter was still the free speech wing of the free speech party. In the golden age of Twitters free speech brand, the company was often lauded for doing the hard thing when standing up to governments worldwide. In retrospect, this corporate hardheadedness was easier to pull off than what theyre doing now, where speech is policed in the name of free speech...The Twitter of today strikes an uneasy balance between its old self and the unapologetic, ideologically-unburdened censoriousness of Facebook and Instagram. It remains yet to be seen whether the company has the vision and creativity to live out its new identity. Its well worth a stroll down memory lane.


In other Twitter news, the widow of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan is suing Twitter for violating the Anti-Terrorism Act, Jonathan Stempel and Alison Frankel report for Reuters.


The app Stolen, which allowed users to collect and trade Twitter profiles, has shut down after being overwhelmed with complaints and concerns about the potential for harassment and abuse. If, like me, you dont understand what the appeal was in the first place, or you want a better understanding of all the things that could or did go wrong, Holly Brockwell interviewed Siqi Chen, the CEO of the company behind Stolen, for Gadgette.


Its never too late for resolutions: Although we missed it when it originally went up, an email from 18Fs Melody Kramer drew our attention to a blog post she co-wrote with Britta Gustafson on 18Fs New Years resolutions, which include developing metrics for measuring progress, improving documentation, improving communication when asking for help; asking for help, make it easier to contribute and to reuse tools theyve built; etc. The full list is worth a perusal.

A United Nations report finds that technology and the world wide web have not led to universalor even expandedprosperity, health, and happiness, as many hoped, Somini Sengupta reports for the New York Times. In fact, she writes, the reports warns that innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment.

One scenario participants were polled on was Free social media: A new social media platform is being used by your former high school to help manage communications about a class reunion...if you choose to participate, you will be creating a profile using your real name and sharing a photo of yourself. Your access to the service is free, but your activity on the site would be used by the site to deliver advertisements it hopes will be appealing to you. A whopping 51 percent of participants said this was not acceptable. This was not always because of the privacy infringements; one participant reported, I have enough social media sites to manage. Id rather they use Facebook, and another wrote, I have no desire to keep in contact with people from high school. The lengthy report has lots more tidbits about when and why Americans will surrender personal information,

Today, Change.org launched Change Politics, a platform where users can create a personalized ballot guidebased on endorsements by the people and organizations they followthat they can take to the polls with them on election day. Ben Rattray, founder and CEO of Change.org, told Civicist that the ultimate aim of the project is to undercut the influence of money in politics by emphasizing trusted endorsements over paid advertising.
The only reason [politicians] care about money is it will convert into votes in some way, Rattray said. If people increasingly base their vote on the opinions of people they trust, because theyre easy-to-access, right on their phone, right before they vote, and not on paid ads, then trust becomes more important than money in politics, and thats the goal.
Screenshot courtesy Change.org
Users can do several things on Change Politics: First, they can pose questions to candidates, and support others questions so that the most popular rise to the top. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Chris Christie, and John Kasich are among the first candidates to agree to respond to questions from Change Politics. Second, users can find people and organizations and see who they are endorsing and why, and write their own endorsements as well. Change Politics has already partnered with a number of national and state organizations, from Americans for Tax Reform to Everytown for Gun Safety, from College Republicans to the Marijuana Policy Project. Finally, before election day users can create a personalized ballot guide based on the people and groups they follow on Change Politics.
In some respects, Change Politics has a lot in common with Votizen, a now-defunct effort to make peoples voting choices and endorsements more socially shareable. (Votizens intellectual property is now part of Brigade.) But Votizen needed to create its user base from scratch. Change Politics is launching with Change.orgs 35 million users in the United States as potential participants in the platform.
Before the February 1 caucus, Change Politics will co-host a digital town hall, with the Des Moines Register, based on the crowdsourced questions for the candidates. Other media partners include the Concord Monitor, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and Town Hall Media.

Although Change Politics is launching just at the presidential level at first, by November Rattray said they hope to have worked their way down the ballot to cover everything from city council to school board elections. A 2015 Knight Foundation report on millennials voting habits found a lack of information about local candidates and issues to be a significant obstacle to voting in local elections.
The goal is [to] turn low-information voters into effectively high-information voters through proxies of friends or people they trust, said Rattray.
Organizations can use the platform to promote their interests and to demonstrate to candidates the influence they have on voters, which is all part of the Change.org plan to make trust count more than dollars.
If youre a candidate, Rattray theorized for Civicist, running for office, and youre considering whether to raise twenty-five thousand dollars, or to convince someone with twenty-five thousand followerswhose endorsement will appear on the mobile phone of twenty-five thousand people who trust them before they votethat trust is worth more than that money.
When asked why they decided to launch an entirely new website, instead of building an extension to Change.org, Rattray explained that they wanted something tailored for the voting experience. We just think that we want to be using the resources and the momentum and mobilization weve already got from Change.org, he told Civicist. But we wanted to optimize an experience specifically around the election.
Before taking a position as senior technology advisor to the White House, the late civic technologist Jake Brewer led the Change Politics project at Change.org. Rattray told Civicist that even after moving to the White House, Brewer remained a close advisor to the project.
He deeply believed in the importance of a more informed democracy and the potential of technology to shift influence toward trusted networks in politics, Rattray added. We hope the impact that citizens have using Change Politics can serve as part of his legacy.

Election 2016Elections 





Tech and the presidentials: On Twitter, the #EmptySeat hashtag was a powerful counterpoint during President Obamas State of the Union speech last night, with hundreds of people sharing the names and pictures of family members theyve lost to gun violence.


Google Trends reports that during the speech, the #2 question most being asked about President Obama was Who is sitting behind Obama?


The Rebel Alliance got @POETUS to deliver a state of the union speech, too.


Speaking of Google Trends, search interest in Bernie Sanders has overtaken interest in Hillary Clinton dramatically in Iowa as polls show the Democratic race tightening there.


MoveOn.org Political Action has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, with what its executive director Ilya Sheyman says was a record-setting 78.6 percent of 340,665 votes cast by its membership. Hillary Clinton got 14.6 percent of the vote, and 5.9 percent favored no endorsement. The group says it has more than 43,000 members in Iowa and more than 30,000 in New Hampshire.


Brave new world: Taking a page from Gary Shteyngarts satirical novel Super Sad True Love Story, the dating app Tinder has an internal scoring system ranking how desirable each user is, Austin Carr reports for Fast Company.

Todays civic tech must-read: mySociety researcher Emily Shaw gives her take on the defining-civic-tech debate. Heres the key graf, IMO:
[I]n the field we are building a clear definition of civic tech. It has to do with the way we believe we improve democratic self-management. We want to improve everyones ability to transmit information about their preferences into government. We want to improve everyones ability to get the information they want out of government. And we want to see what happens as information is processed in the middle. Civic technology seeks to improve government input/output, while opening the process to full view.

First Post 





A screenshot of one of the OCO-2 maps that accompanies each iSeeChange.org post.

Radio producer Julia Drapkin was tired of climate reporting. Not of the subject itself, but of the routine, which she found lacking: First, a scientist must pose a question, conduct research, and eventually publish. Only then can a reporter write a story, maybe interview the scientist, and maybeif she has time, which she rarely doesfind a local anecdote to make the story familiar.
That wasnt working anymore. It never really did, Drapkin told Civicist.
Drapkin wanted to turn that model on its head, to put the local anecdote at the heart of climate reporting. The project she proposed and eventually secured funding for in 2012 became iSeeChange: a citizen-science-slash-journalism project that relaunched last year with a new website, optimized for mobile, and expanded coverage nationwide. The project also received an institutional stamp of approval in the form of a new partnership with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in addition to partnerships with the Berkeley Atmospheric CO2 Observation Network (BEACO2N) and Yale Climate Connections, and with numerous radio stations around the country.
Experts in Their Own Backyard
In 2012, Drapkins proposal was selected by the Association for Independence in Radio (AIR) to be part of the inaugural year of the Localore initiative, a program to support innovation in locally-produced public media. As a condition of the year-long grant, Drapkin moved from New Orleans to western Colorado to lead the iSeeChange pilot at community radio station KVNF-FM in Paonia.
She started simply, by going on air and asking the audience what they were seeing change that season.
We just started getting these phenomenal tips, Drapkin said. They tipped us off to the earliest spring [on record] in the history of the United States; they started talking about wildfires and droughts two months, three months in advance of mainstream news...we were talking about West Nile Virus early.
In many ways, that first year was a proof of concept, all before they even got a website up and running.
People are experts in their own backyard, Drapkin said. We underestimate peoples ability to flag things that are really significant. And if we provide a platform on which people can do that, thats really important.
The first iSeeChange website, The Almanac, launched in February 2013. Posts could be viewed by week, by season, or by year, and the websites whimsical header photo evoked the old-time feel of the weather-forecasting periodical, the Farmers Almanac.

While developing the iSeeChange model, Drapkin also discovered a longstanding tradition of note-keeping in the small Colorado community that dated back to the Dust Bowl, at least.
They read like tweets from the 1920s and 30s, Drapkin said of the daily diary entries of farmers like William Beezley. And you could see that these were climate records...notes from the last major, man-made environmental crisis, the Dust Bowl, [and] you could see the parallels between that time and 2012 happening in near-real-time. It was mind-blowing.
Drapkin believes that iSeeChange is as important a resource for future generations as it is for ours, and that it is a weather-forecasting tool as well as a historical record.
We need to write everything down so that this generation can have a record to pass onto the next, so that we have a baseline to be able to really gauge change, she said.

Not just record-highs and record-lows, she adds, but how we are impacted...because you cant record that from a weather station.
A month after the website launched Drapkins Localore funding ran out.
iSeeChange in Limbo
Without funding, Drapkin had to move back to New Orleans and iSeeChange fell into a lull. KVNF kept the project going in that little corner of Colorado, but the project had otherwise stalled.
People kept using it [the website], but nobody was answering them, Drapkin explained. I couldnt scale myself without any additional resources.
In spite of her success in Paonia and even a feature on This American Life, Drapkin had trouble finding new funding. It was like crickets, she said.
In the course of hustling for grants or other opportunities for iSeeChange, Drapkin was invited to speak at both NASA headquarters and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and something clicked.
I said, we at iSeeChange, in this community, were near-sensing, Drapkin told Civicist. You guys [at NASA JPL] are remote-sensing. How do we connect the dots?
In October 2013, iSeeChange and NASA held a workshop on tackling the challenges and opportunities of citizen science, and how to better connect the scientific community with the general public. The workshop led to a partnership with NASA JPL and a new mission: to integrate satellite data on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels into a new iSeeChange platform.
In late 2014, Drapkin finally secured new funding from AIR to scale the iSeeChange model nationwide and began gearing up for the relaunch.
Observation and Data, Side by Side
Several months earlier, in July 2014, NASA had launched its first satellite dedicated to measuring levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). (The original Orbiting Carbon Observatory crashed into the ocean near Antartica minutes after launching in February 2009, when the payload fairing failed to separate, preventing the satellite from making orbit.)
Data supplied by OCO-2 will help identify and characterize sources and sinks (absorption sites) of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and to quantify carbon dioxide variability over the seasons. And now, through the partnership between NASA JPL and iSeeChange, OCO-2 data will add context to crowdsourced climate observations, and vice versa. Geotagged posts on the new iSeeChange website include temperature and other statistics, including humidity, wind speed, and visibility, as well as the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the area.
For example, when Eliot Walter posted a photo of a mosquito taken on December 30 in Lexington, Kentucky, the iSeeChange website filled in a 7:14:24 pm reading from forecast.io, and a carbon dioxide reading of 403.70 ppm, which had been recorded 93 miles away on November 10. (Atmospheric carbon dioxide only surpassed 400 ppm in 2013, a first since scientists began keeping track in 1958.)
Because of the nature of a satellite, NASA does not have a constant, complete picture of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, they get skinny swaths of data, the science data applications lead for OCO-2, Karen Yuen, explained to Civicist.
OCO-2 makes 14.5 orbits of the earth a day but the spectrometer used to take measurements must be focused very tightly on a small area, which limits coveragethats why the closest carbon dioxide reading for an iSeeChange post could be almost 100 miles away. On top of that, measurements cant be taken through cloud cover. Every day we make about a million measurements but only keep 100,000 of them because of the clouds, Yuen said.
NASA estimates that they get a complete picture of global carbon every 16 days, Yuen tells Civicist.
When you zoom out on one of the carbon dioxide maps on iSeeChange, you see what Yuen means by skinny swaths of data.

But with computer modeling, NASA can do impressive things with that data, including produce short videos like A Year in the Life of Earths CO2.

Making the Invisible, Visible
When we started we didnt know exactly what we were going to be able to do with the data, we had just this basic idea of syncing the data with posts, Drapkin told Civicist.
The trick is that CO2 is an invisible gas, Karen Yuen explained. Short of providing micro-sensors to people, how else can we get people to want to participate in a citizen science project with us where they cannot see the gas? Well, what we can ask people to do is report out what they can see and feel from the ground. By noting changes from the ground such as early bloom, increased dust, temperature, taking a picture of something unusual, the citizen scientist is helping to create their own regional database every time anyone uploads information.
If you take the iSeeChange data about how weather and climate change are impacting your daily life and juxtapose it with carbon, we are telling a story about climate change in a very new and different way, Drapkin said.
Yuen said that citizen science is an ongoing pitch of hers at NASA. Generally speaking, she said, those in management are often fans of the idea but worry about backing a project that seems out of their control. Scientists are an equally hard sell, she said, fretting over whether the information will be up to their standards.
What I told them was thats not the point, Yuen said. Something is better than nothing...when people point out areas where they say we noticed something different, you guys should look at that, thats like a needle in a haystack. Thats really important.
The new iSeeChange website has a feature for precisely that: a button that allows users to flag posts as weird and worthy of additional scrutiny and investigation.
Even without the needle-in-the-haystack observations, or the climate change narrative that could emerge from the juxtaposition of data and observation, the partnership will get this particular data set in front of more eyes, which is one of NASAs organizational goals: to reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind.
Looking for Legitimacy
Citizen science is far from new. In the mid-18th century, for example, a Norwegian bishop called upon a network of clergymen to keep him in observations of and specimens from the natural world. However, the decreasing cost of tools and sensors, not to mention the proliferation of mini-computers that many of us carry around all day, every day, has allowed citizen science to flourish to an unprecedented extent.
In 2007, the public helped classify the shapes of one million galaxies in only three weeks as part of a project called Galaxy Zoo. Before Galaxy Zoo launched, astronomers had estimated that it would take experts three to five years to complete the task.
Lucy Fortson, one of the co-founders of the Citizen Science Alliance (CSA), which oversees Galaxy Zoo and the other projects that populate the citizen-science platform Zooniverse, believes that citizen-science projects should have the capacity to produce peer-reviewed science. Galaxy Zoo was among the earliest citizen-science projects to do so. Since then, CSA projects have resulted in nearly 50 articles that have appeared in peer-reviewed journals.
But Galaxy Zoo is data analysis, not data collection. Every classification is agreed upon by consensus, involving at least 20 individuals.
The challenge with projects like iSeeChange, Fortson explained, is substantiating observations with additional data.The difficulty is if you have someone who could be an expert, she said, who could say Weve never have a second crop of raspberries.
But that just doesnt carry the same weight as 20 people saying, I had a second crop of raspberries, too.
However, Fortson is also familiar with the power of the crowd to find anomalies in a large data set. When CSA created an online forum where citizen scientists could discuss their work with project scientists and with each other, volunteers began making discoveries of their own.
Unlike a machine, a human can say, Ooh, that looks really weird and post about it on the forum, Fortson said. Thats how a group of volunteers discovered what has been dubbed the Green Pea galaxies, for their small size and bright green color.
Her words recall those of both Karen Yuen and Julia Drapkin, explaining the reasoning behind iSeeChange.
A New Citizen Science
ISeeChange does not fit in the clearly defined box of citizen science that Galaxy Zoo belongs to, but its not the first to break down barriers between disciplines, either.
Jeffrey Warren, one of the co-founders of the Public Lab, a nonprofit dedicated to democratizing science in the pursuit of environmental justice, draws a distinction between citizen science and community science. He sees the first as being primarily concerned with getting people to submit data or to perform a simple task, like identifying a type of galaxy or a species of animal.
He defines community science, on the other hand, as the engagement of the public at all levels of the scientific process.
We typically dont call ourselves a citizen science organization, Public Lab executive director Shannon Dosemagen told techPresident in 2014. We dont want to be...posing research questions and then telling people to give us data...We work way outside of what the normal scope of that is.
The same could be said of Drapkins iSeeChange: an entirely people-powered platform, without an explicit research question other than, Hey guys, whats new? Whats different?
One thing thats more challenging with this broader, squishier kind of citizen science is that it is harder to prove success. Lucy Fortson can point to nearly 50 peer-reviewed articles and say Thats what weve accomplished, but with Public Lab projects or iSeeChange, those metrics are less defined.
Warren told Civicist that early onPublic Lab was created in 2011they measured success by participation and engagement.
Now were more mature, people are more interested in outcomesmeasurable impacts on the world, Warren said. [For example], data being used in legal proceedings, [and] regulatory outcomes. But even if they have some concrete successes, there are reverberating impacts that are nearly impossible to measure, like changes in perception, corporations...the EPA, or politicians [becoming] more aware of peoples ability to organize and collect data.
ISeeChange declined to share contributor numbers, but even if they had, the absolute reach of the project would be similarly hard to quantify, because it would include radio listeners and random social media users. (Some stations, in the early years, didnt require listeners to post on The Almanac website and instead had them submit observations on Twitter or Facebook using the hashtag #iSeeChange, which Drapkin said they at one point shared with a weight-loss program.)
Drapkin can point to the numerous radio stories that iSeeChange has inspired, but the impact of those stories is hard to measure. Karen Yuen would like people to be inspired by the project to make changes in their daily lives, to drive less or not to not rely so heavily on their air conditioner. Yuen told Civicist that NASA will at some point publish a report on the project, detailing what worked, what didnt work, and best practices for future collaborations of a similar nature.
The advantage of the dual citizen-science, citizen-journalism qualities of iSeeChange is the built-in broadcast component guaranteed to spread the word far and wide.
Now to see who heeds their call, and what they can all accomplish.

First Post 




Between Christmas and Jan. 2, Taiwan held its first and only vice-presidential debate and two presidential debates in advance of the Jan. 16 election. The first presidential debate was pretty standard: Candidates answered questions from the news media and then took part in three rounds of direct debates with one another.
The second presidential debate, however, included something new: five questions from the public.
The questions, all policy-related, were submitted via the online platform President, May I Ask a Question and voted on by the public. The platform was first used during Taiwans vice-presidential debate; here are the six public questions selected for that forum. 
Watchout spokesman Lin Zu-yi told Taiwans press last month that Watchout would select questions by lottery, drawing only from those questions that received at least 1,000 online signatures. Well have more on President, May I Ask a Questiondeveloped by Google, the newspaper Apple Daily, and Watchoutin a future article.
Plus: Remember Mitt Romneys comment regarding binders full of women during a 2012 presidential debate and the memes that followed? KMT presidential candidate Eric Chus comment during the first debate about being encouraged to run by an unnamed elder woman sparked a similar flurry of responses, including the Facebook parody page Tamsui Grandma. Another site, Taiwan Fugue, is offering stickers for those worried about being held responsible for Chus campaign.
The Tamsui Grandma parody page on Facebook has more than 37,000 likes.
Catherine Chou, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, has a fascinating analysis of the responses, looking at how language interweaves with humor. That Chu would use Taiwanese when telling a humanizing story about an elderly lady is predictable; what is less so is that netizens and new political partiesoverwhelmingly composed of the youngwould respond in the same language, writes Chou.
In other debate news ...
How to Avoid Campaign Fatigue: Not every country is as speedy as Taiwan when it comes to presidential campaigns, but the United States is more like a marathonor two. Brian Dickerson of the Detroit Free Press looks at how other countries manage to keep their campaigns shorter by putting limits on time, spending and/or by offering public financing. Is the U.S. system, which gives more time to candidates to make their case through primaries and debates, more democratic, or simply more adept at supporting all the third-party donors, businesses, journalists, and consultants who benefit from long campaigns?
U.S. Debates Popular in China: The Guojiang Subtitle Group in China, a group of about 70 volunteers who produce subtitles for American TV shows, are translating the U.S. presidential debates. The videos, which are uploaded to a Weibo account and onto Chinese video-sharing sites, have become quite a hit in China, reports Owe Guo in The New York Times. The group was started by Zhou Qianyu, a Beijing high school student, in 2014.
Chinese translation of Republican debate hosted by CNN and Facebook.
Watching the U.S. presidential debates is like watching a football match, said Yin Hao, one of the translators. You see a lot of moves and tactics by the candidates, but eventually it all comes down to who scores. You can watch the debates on Sina Video. Read the Times story for examples of comments by Chinese viewers.
From Parliament to Television: Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a live, televised annual state of the nation debate among party leaders. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron told The Independent they would take part if Prime Minister David Cameron is willing.
That seems unlikely. Downing Street has said it will look at the formal details of any proposal, which is throat-clearing in advance of saying no, writes political columnist Rafael Behr, who takes a broader look at debate participation and the shortcomings of prime ministers questions. The call for an annual debate comes on the heels of a report by University of Leeds researchers showing that the 2015 general election debates increased viewers engagement.
Second Screen Study: A study published in the Journal of Communication found that people who use social media to discuss televised debates are more likely to become engaged in politics as a result. The study, Dual Screening the Political: Media Events, Social Media, and Citizen Engagement, focuses on Twitter use during the 2014 European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom.
Twitter users who more actively participated in the discussion about the debates on social media using hashtags like #NickvNigel, #CleggFarage and #europedebate came away more energized and engaged with politics, the authors of the study wrote in the Washington Post. New York Universitys Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab helped the studys authors identify social media users who tweeted about the debates.
Get Those Second (and Third) Screens Ready: YouTube and NBC News are teaming up for the final Democratic presidential debate before the Iowa Caucus. The NBC News-YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate, hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, will take place Sunday, Jan. 17, in Charleston, S.C., with the action streamed live on the NBC News YouTube channel. The announcement notes that the debate will feature questions from the YouTube community, but we havent seen information yet on what that might involve. Check Civicist for post-debate coverage.
Before Democrats take the stage, FOX Business Network will host a Republican presidential primary debate on Thursday, Jan. 14, also in South Carolina. Happy New Year, and happy debate watching! Sign up for the twice-monthly Rethinking Debates newsletter for the latest posts and news.

Election 2016Rethinking DebatesSocial MediaWorld 




Long-form: Twitter is considering offering its users a 10,000 character limit, up from 140, Kurt Wagner reports for Re/Code. More details from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, here.
On Slate, Will Oremus hot take is that this means Twitter is trying to build a wall to encompass stories that its users may post. Thats because Twitter is struggling to compete with rivals like Snapchat, Instagram, and Tumblr, all of which are designed to keep users in rather than continually sending them out to the broader Web to view content, he writes.
Tech and the presidentials: Donald Trump may appear to be winging his campaign, only beginning to pour millions into traditional TV ads this week. But as Kenneth Vogel and Darren Samuelsohn report for Politico, for several months he actually has been working with an experienced data team to build sophisticated models to transform fervor into votes. True to form, Politico is hyping this story by calling it Trumps data juggernaut but so far the operation looks more like a data rickshaw.
MoveOn.org Political Action is launching a formal vote of its membership to see if should endorse a presidential candidate, starting tomorrow, its executive director Ilya Sherman announced. The group, which has an online membership of about 8 million, endorsed Barack Obama in 2008.
This is civic tech: Capitol Bells launched a new Reddit-like civic engagement mobile app yesterday, and its founder Ted Henderson celebrated with an AMA on Reddit along with Alex Ebert, the lead singer of the band Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, who also happens to be a civic hacker (say what?!).
Judging from the user comments, folks were a lot more interested in Ebert than Henderson, which is a shame because Capitol Bells new app is pretty intriguing. On top of giving users instantaneous updates about pending House or Senate votes, and allowing them to compare their preferences to their representatives (a trope of nearly every such app), CB also has a Lobby where users can anonymously post and poll each other on political gossip. (Think of that as Brigade without the real-name policy.) That said, Eberts new site, The New IRS, is also worth checking out. It gives users the opportunity to allocate government tax collections how they would like them to be spent and then compare that to the actual breakdown of government spending. He describes it as a virtuality. an experience of a more powerful democracy, a talking piece, and a data collection point.
Heres Eberts vision (per his AMA): Political engagement must become facile, swift, and the results must feel and be immediately tangible  just like life. tech facilitates worldwide instantaneousness  a virtual town hall the world over  meaning real participatory democracy is, now, possible. Dude!
Heres Eberts song for Bernie Sanders, The Bern. Should he stick to his day job?
With the unprecedented release of detailed incident-level crime data by New York Citys police department, civic hackers are starting to build some great visualizations. Heres CivicDashboards interactive map showing crime by type, neighborhood, volume, and month. And heres IQuantNYs detailed dissection of the data.
You can now dive deep into the New York Public Librarys special collections of archival photographs, maps and other public domain files, as Jennifer Schuessler reports for the New York Times. Nearly 200,000 high-quality files are available for download, courtesy of NYPL Labs, along with APIs for using them more easily. Heres a photo from the librarys collection of the entrance to Civic Halls 156 Fifth Ave address, from 1911. Kudos to the library for taking such an open approach!
mySocietys second TICTeC 2016, its research conference on the impacts of civic tech, is taking place in Barcelona April 27-28, and the call for papers is now open.

Todays civic tech must-read: The founder of the Govtech Fund, Ron Bouganim, has penned an excellent update on the state of govtech, which he defines as the operating system for governmentthe infrastructure and tools government agencies use everyday to do their jobs. He says the field is booming, thanks to a number of trends including government adoption of the cloud, budget constraints, a massive government personnel retirement cycle and an open data movement have coalesced to create an openness on the part of government agencies to embrace new technologies and a dramatically shortened sales cycle. And he helpfully distinguishes govtech from civic tech, the operating system of the citizen, in which he includes community organizing, petitions, advocacy, connecting with elected officials, politics and campaigns, the citizen journalist, and much more.
Speaking of community organizing, a group of longtime feminist online organizers, including Civic Hall members Deanna Zandt of Lux Digital and Jeanne Brooks of Datakind, along with Tracy Van Slyke of Culture Lab and Sabrina Hersi Issa of Be Bold Media (longtime Personal Democracy Media friends all, I should add), have launched ShineSquad to organize a systemic response to the problem of sexual harassment and assault in social change organizations, as Juana Summers reports for Mashable. Their effort is a direct response to the collapse of FitzGibbon Media but is rooted in a much longer and largely hidden history of abuse and neglect of the issue.
The Sunlight Foundations president, Christopher Gates, is stepping down, the organizations co-founder Michael Klein announced yesterday. Stepping in as interim executive director is longtime Sunlight policy director John Wonderlich. We wish the best of luck to them both!
Trump watch: Donald Trumps new TV ad, the first of his presidential campaign, which you should not ignore because it is going to play constantly in Iowa and New Hampshire for the next few weeks, blatantly conflates being Muslim with being a terrorist, and shows ominous pictures of dark-skinned people while promising to build a border fence that Mexico will pay for. Despite the ads explicit racism, many political commentators have generally confined themselves to asking whether it will be effective. As if they were in the 1930s covering the German parliamentary elections like they were a normal event: Wolf Blitzer: How do you think the new radio ad the Nazis have been runningthe one where they blame the Jews for the economic collapse and Germanys weakness in the worldis going to play as we head into the final weeks of the election, panel? Cokie Roberts: Well, honestly Wolf, the tone is a bit strong but its clearly working for Adolf. German voters seem attracted to his tell-it-like-it-is style. Mark Halperin: Its just another amazing piece of work by Goebbels. Hes really got his finger on the pulse of the German electorate. Etc. etc.
Or, theyve tried to fact-check it, as Politifacts C. Eugene Emery Jr. and Louis Jacobson point out, its image of people swarming a border is actually from footage of migrants trying to cross from Morocco to Spain, and marked the ad pants on fire. Asked about that supposed error, his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told NBC News, No shits not the Mexican border but thats what our country is going to look like. This was 1,000 percent on purpose.
Among the Eight Causes of Trumpism, longtime political commentator Norman Ornstein writes in the Atlantic, one must count the internet. He blames it for a dramatic deterioration of civil discourse and social standards (i.e. comment pages and chat rooms where nothing is too course or off limits anymore), the ease with which conspiracy theorists can now engage in collective action (i.e. Here Comes Every Birther!), and the rise of echo chambers where we can all actively seek out the information sources [we] wantand actively avoid those that provide dissonant information.
Brave new world: Liberty Mutual has just launched a new partnership with Subaru, offering drivers discounts for installing and abiding by a car app that tells them when they are accelerating or braking too fast, and Brian Fung of the Washington Post uses that news to offer a warning about how these new usage-tracking technologies may also endanger drivers privacy, lead to new kinds of legal liabilities and potentially higher rates for non-compliance.
Security researchers believe a power failure that hit regional power authorities in Ukraine last week was caused by malicious code designed to sabotage industrial control systems, Dan Goodin reports for ArsTechnica. This may be the first time a cyber-attack on energy targets actually caused a blackout.

Its not every day that you turn over a rock and find $400 billion dollars. Nor is it every day that youre able to invest in tools that power the glue of society on a global scale. At the Govtech Fund weve been fortunate to be able to do both.
VCs historically ran for the hills whenever they heard the word government and for good reason: software sales cycles were measured in years, governments often required a ton of product customization and a byzantine structure of prime and sub-contractors made it impossible to actually deploy solutions even after a deal was won.
However, in the past couple of years, a number of trends including government adoption of the cloud, budget constraints, a massive government personnel retirement cycle, and an open data movement have coalesced to create an openness on the part of government agencies to embrace new technologies and a dramatically shortened sales cycleour portfolio companies average is just 86 days.
The average sales cycle of our govtech startups is 86 days.
VCs have taken notice: since we launched our fund 12 months ago, top-tier VCs, angels, and strategics have invested $45M alongside our $6M in the Seed, Series A, and follow-on rounds of our seven portfolio companies. A number of our startups already have term sheets in hand that indicate 2016 will see that follow-on investment figure more than double to $100M.
Governments are massive enterprises.
Lets just start with the U.S. government. First, there are 22 million people employed at the federal, state, and local levels. To put that in context, thats roughly 15 percent of the entire U.S. labor force. Another way to think about it: the companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (e.g. Microsoft, Exxon, Home Depot, McDonalds, etc.) employ 6 million people. That means the U.S. government employs roughly four times the number of people as all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, combined.
The U.S. government is the single largest enterprise in America.
Governments spend a lot on technology every year.
So the U.S. government is big. Now add in the governments of every other country around the world and youll get the sense of how big a market opportunity govtech is. In fact, Gartner reports governments spend $400+ billion dollars a year on govtech.
Govtech is the operating system of governmentthe infrastructure and tools government agencies use everyday to do their jobs.
So what tools and infrastructure are government agencies around the world spending $400 billion a year on?

permitting
planning & code enforcement
procurement
law enforcement
GIS mapping
tax collection
fraud detection
budgeting
pension management
bond issuance
asset management
operational reporting
transit planning

...and on and on.
Government employees are just as frustrated by waste as you are.
One of the best parts of my job is that I get to talk to government employees every day. I have yet to meet anyone working in government that wants to waste taxpayer dollars. Rather, the folks Ive met are dedicated to finding ways to improve their respective communities but often have antiquated tools to work with. Theyre embarrassed to read headlines that all to often highlight the inevitable failure of large, over-budget, delayed, waterfall custom IT projects.
New tools for government employees are coming to market.
The good news is that, unlike legacy government vendors, our portfolio of startups offer government customers:

Software As A Service delivered seamlessly in the cloud
cost literally 10-100x less than existing solutions
beautifully designed with the end user as the starting point
single-point solution ie. not a platform trying to do everything for different
departments
B2G focus: government agencies are the direct users and/or customers
multi-agency focus at all levels of government (eg. city, state, federal)
not regulatory wedge plays, no lobbying to secure a sale

And our software startups are being built by some amazing entrepreneurs:

most of our founders are millennials working on their first startups
our founders are graduates from Stanford, Harvard, Princeton and many other
top-tier computer science programs in the US
engineering centric startup cultures
two of our seven startups have women co-founders
building industry cloud leaders

Results from our portfolioour first year:
Our portfolio has had tremendous velocity this past year:

our startups collectively engage with 12,000+ government agencies
one of our startups signed 139 agencies ie. one every three days
one of our startups has grown topline revenue 16 percent per month for 35 months
one of our startups signed its second agency in just 2 weeks! ($293K)

In the past 12 months, weve invested $6M in seven startups and had $45M of follow-on/co-investments by leading VCs. Heading into 2016, a number of our startups already have term sheets in hand that suggest that follow-on figure will more than double to $100M.
Civictech: the other critical technology for our society.
While we exclusively invest in govtech here at the Govtech Fund, there is another equally important movement that is redefining 21st century societies: civictech. Citizen engagement in their own governance is critical to the health of any society and civic technologies will be transformative. As the operating system of citizens, civictech covers a broad range of citizen engagement and personal democracy related activities including community organizing, petitions, advocacy, connecting with elected officials, politics and campaigns, the citizen journalist and much more.
Civictech is the operating system of the citizen, the tools citizens use everyday to engage in their governance.
I am concerned about the sustainability of civictech startups where the business models and paying customers are often less clear than for govtech startups. The most expensive form of investment dollarsthe kind that VCs deployhas difficulty justifying investments in spaces when addressable paying markets are not well defined. So I applaud non-profit transformers such the Omidyar Network, the Knight Foundation and others for having stepped in to fill the funding void but civictech startups need greater support from citizens themselves if we are going to ensure their long term sustainability. I donate a significant percentage of my income to non-profits focusing on civictech and I regularly encourage my Silicon Valley peers to do the same.
Govtech: a multi-decade, $400B global investment opportunity.
These are nascent days for the govtech movement. Regardless of your political leanings and whether you advocate for more or for less government, the fact is that governments play a central role in organizing and delivering services that citizens cannot do on their own. In the modern era of smartphones, self-driving cars and microsatellites, its inconceivable that governments will be able to execute policy without providing their employees the most modern tools available to do their jobs.
Multiple market, technology and demographic drivers have coalesced such that we are at the beginning of a multi-decade, multi-billion dollar technology replacement cycle in governments around the world. Startups that solve critical pain points for government employees will be the beneficiaries and govtech will prove to be one of the biggest market opportunities hiding in plain sight.

News feeders: Politicos Nancy Scola offers a smart look at why so many political players are turning to Medium to post their thoughts, rather than running the gauntlet of old medias op-ed editors. (I have to add: isnt Medium just the Huffington Post with a much better publishing platform and less of an overtly liberal slant?)
On Medium (naturally), Andrew Hayward of MIT Media Labs Electome project offers some first findings from the projects comparison of political news coverage to Twitter conversation (in English) related to the presidential election. Given that Electome has access to the full Twitter hose, theres good reason to expect some fresh insights here from exploring what Twitter users talk about compared to what the media focuses on, but count me dissatisfied so far. Heyward gives us some pretty charts that imply that Electomes data scientists have figured out how to measure such things as Donald Trumps percentage share of media coveragewhen in fact they are only looking at 12 news publications, not the entire universe of news media. Nor does he explain how his team counts the coverage a candidate gets when they are one of several mentioned in a story, or how they weight headlines vs text. But hey, its big data, so enjoy!
CrowdTangle tracks engagement on Facebook, and here lists the top ten progressive Facebook pages in terms of the total engagement they drove in 2015.

No, we havent heard of any of them.
Will Oremus of Slate got an inside look at how Facebook keeps tweaking its News Feed algorithm, and the result is a long piece that impressively manages to avoid asking any hard questions about its workings.

I dont think Ive read a more cogent analysis of just what irks Donald Trump than this witty essay from Megan Carpentier in The Guardian, commenting on his recent declaration that Hillary Clinton had been schlonged in 2008 by Barack Obama: ...in 2015, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination has admitted that hes grossed out by the thought of women urinating, hes disgusted by breast-feeding, he thinks menstruation is a mind-altering phenomenon, and he thinks that the best rhetorical method for referring to a womans campaign loss is to evoke mental images of her getting bested by a penis. One would think that a man who likes to build skyline-altering, metal-and-glass phalluses and slap his name on them couldnt pantomime his sexual insecurities any louder.
Tech and the presidentials: Believe it or not, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both agree about the role of technology in fighting terrorismand theyre equally wrong about it. Thats Brian Fungs point in this smart piece for the Washington Post, where he argues that they each are advocating policies that display a common ignorance about how the Internet and online communications actually work and a naive faith in cyber geniuses. I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts, Clinton said at Saturdays Democratic presidential debate, regarding their ability to solve the encryption dilemma. We should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds, to figure out a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet, Trump declared at this months GOP debate.
David Dayen argues for Salon that the real scandal in the Sanders-NGP-VAN-DNC data war is the partys de facto creation of a monopoly on voter data services, a single-point of failure full of risk for its candidates.
And NationBuilders Will Conway piles on in Medium with a very similar argument.

After the San Bernardino shooting earlier this month, California-based neurologist and social activist Faisal Qazi started a fundraiser for the victims families on LaunchGood, a crowdfunding site run by and for the Muslim community. Qazi launched the campaign before it was even known that the perpetrators of the shooting were also Muslim, but when the fact emerged, the fundraiser gave the Muslim-American community an outlet to demonstrate solidarity with the victims and their families, and to distance themselves from the violence perpetratedan outlet increasingly necessary if American Muslims are to counter the Islamophobia proliferating in public and private discourse right now. More than 2,000 supporters raised a total of $215,515.
This united American Muslim campaign aims to reclaim our faith from extremists by responding to evil with good, said co-organizer Tarek El-Messidi in a campaign press release.
LaunchGood, which celebrated its two-year anniversary in October, and MPower Change, a digital organizing platform that quietly launched this fall, together are carving out space for American Muslims to communicate, collaborate, and agitate online. While other ethnic and religious groups have long had dedicated online platforms for political organizingAfrican Americans have Color of Change; Latinos have Presente; Asian Americans have 18 Million Rising; Christians have Faithful AmericaMPower Change and LaunchGood are among the first digital organizing platforms for American Muslims.
In a recent interview with Colorlines, MPower Change co-founder Linda Sarsour bemoaned the lack of platforms for civically-minded American Muslims:
Well have a social media campaign that will get buzz for a day or two but we lose people immediately after the frenzy. The Muslim community has been able to have a few campaigns that have trended and shift the conversation, but once theyre over we have to start from scratch...We want to create our own online base that we can consistently engage on multiple issues.
The appeal of a crowdfunding site by and for Muslims was two-fold, LaunchGood co-founder and COO Amany Killawi tells Civicist. During the five years she worked as a community organizer, primarily with inner-city youth, Killawi had crowdfunded several programs and had become aware of the transformative power of crowdfunding. She liked that it was decentralized and transparent, that it activated the community, and that it generated publicity for community projects and activism.
As for her co-founder Chris Blauvelt, Killawi said that he was one of the first Muslims to enter the crowdfunding space. In 2010, just over a year after Kickstarter launched, Blauvelt started a crowdfunding campaign there for Bilals Stand, a film about a Muslim teen he helped produce, and which was eventually screened at the Sundance Film Festival. Killawi said Blauvelt saw how crowdfunding campaigns were impacting the mainstream, pointing out that a not-insignificant number of Sundance films start out as Kickstarter projects10 percent in 2012, the year before they started LaunchGoodand he wanted to see the global Muslim community benefit from the same groundswell of support.
The mission of LaunchGood is to inspire everyday Muslims to just do amazing work, Killawi explains, adding that the work does not have to be restricted to the Muslim community. She cites a LaunchGood campaign to help rebuild the primarily-black churches in Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas that were targeted by arsonists earlier this year.
According to LaunchGoods online statistics, 491 projects have been funded, with 30,745 users raising over 5 million dollars. They also boast higher success rates than other top platforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe.
Even so, the fundraiser for San Bernardino families broke site records, Blauvelt told the Los Angeles Times, with pledges at one point topping out at $1,000 an hour. Qazi and co. raised more than $215,000 in total for the victims and their families. Qazi told the Los Angeles Times that the money would be distributed through San Bernardino County and the United Way.
These campaigns start to counter the narrative of who Muslims really are, Killawi said. Youll see on Yahoo news Trump saying Ban All Muslims! and right next to it Muslims Raise $100,000 For San Bernardino. Theres nothing like putting money where your mouth is.
Killawi reports that growth is strong, especially after the slow start for the first six months after launching, and that they are looking to expand to Canada and the U.K. in the near future.
If LaunchGood has become a place for the Muslim community to respond to collective tragedy (among other causes), MPower Change is the place for harnessing collective outrage. Although co-founder Mark Crain tells Civicist that a platform like this has been a subject of conversations between Muslim activists since 2011, it wasnt until late this September that, in partnership with MoveOn, they put out their first online campaigna petition to ban Ben Carson from GOP debates unless he recanted several outrageous statements about Islam.
Other MPower Change petitions released since September include one asking that the AP use Daesh instead of Islamic State, and one asking that the New York Post stop inflammatory reporting on terrorist attacks like the one in San Bernardino. This rapid-response, roll-with-the-media-cycle activism follows in the tradition of MoveOn, where Crain works as a campaign director, and the suite of progressive online organizing platforms that MoveOn inspired and supported in the years after launching.
This sort of model works best in moments of collective outrage, Crain said. And, he suggests, thats good enough for MPower, especially in these early days.
He elaborated:
Once weve established ourselves, and our membership has really grown, and weve spent some time cultivating relationships with those members, and weve identified the emergent leaders out of the bunch, theres going to be an opportunity for us to invest in some long-term campaigns. But this model is probably best suited to work in rapid response moments, moments where egregious statements are made or egregious actions are taken by someone and its sort of in the zeitgeist, its being popularly covered by the media or its taken over social media...and people are looking for an opportunity to respond. Were here to give them that vehicle to respond.
In order to do so, Crain said that as an organization they need to demonstrate a theory of change for why the requested actionsigning a petition or similaris actually going to make a difference.
Take the petition responding to the New York Posts flawed reporting on San Bernardino. Maybe theyre not going to issue a retraction, Crain said, but over time, our presence as an organization thats mobilizing people to push back and say this is unacceptable, is going to change the way in which [journalists]...cover this issue.
When asked how MPower Change will resolve conflicting views in their membership base, Crain said, Were not required by any means to take on every issue that has ever plagued the Muslim community.
Our job, he added, is to identify those moments in which our membership is united around taking an action and then to give them an opportunity to express themselves.
MPower Change is preparing to hire its first campaign manager. Although they are a new addition to the online progressive sphere, with support from organizations like MoveOnnot to mention the grassroots organizations many of MPowers leadership come fromthey are surely a player to watch, especially in the current political climate.

OrganizingPetitions 



Taiwans three presidential candidates have agreed to take part in two televised debates before the Jan. 16 election.
One of the debates will feature questions from the media, and the other will include questions from representatives of civic groups, Alex Huang, director of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Department of News and Information, told the Taipei Times.
Candidates will also answer questions from the public submitted via President, may I ask a question?, an online platform launched by Google, the newspaper Apple Daily, and Watchout, which works to engage citizens and hold politicians accountable.
All three are among the nine debate sponsors. Other media sponsors include the Central News Agency (CNA), Sanlih E-Televison (SET-TV), Public Television Service, and three other major dailiesthe United Daily News, the China Times, and the Liberty Times.
As we noted last week in the Rethinking Debates newsletter (have you  signed up?), Taiwans political parties agreed to three debates following contentious negotiations over the format and hosts. The presidential debates have since been finalized for Dec. 27 and Jan. 2. The vice-presidential candidates will meet first, on Dec. 26.
The presidential and vice-presidential campaigns received the official greenlight to start, well, campaigning just this past Saturday.
Besides being amazed by the 28-day campaign limit (what would we do with all the free time?), well be watching to see which questions are answered when voters use the ever-so-polite President, may I ask a question?
A Winning Performance
Spain is confronting a new political reality after Sundays election broke the countrys two-party dominance and left the selection of prime minister in question.
Seven debates were organized in the run-up to the election, with some of them embracing social media and innovative formats. A youth-focused forum in November, for example, was billed as the first digital debate on Twitter, with real-time questioning and commentary. Sponsored by Twitter and the European Youth Forum, representatives from six political parties took part:

Later debates featuring opposition party leaders were broadcast on YouTube and on the website of the countrys largest daily newspaper, El Pais.
Incumbent Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy agreed to only one debate, a sit-down with Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez. Held on Dec. 14, it was the campaigns final debate, and it did not go well for Rajoy.
The Podemos party, which was founded in 2014, made stunning gains in the election, but it would not have come as a huge surprise to those who were closely following the debates. Even though he was not invited to the final debate, Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos party leader and founder, won the El Pais debate, according to a poll sponsored by the newspaper.
Televised Debates Play a Civic Role
So how much do televised debates matter? In the UK, quite a lot, according to new study.
University of Leeds researchers concluded that the 2015 general election debates performed a crucially important civic role, both by reaching younger and first-time voters and by helping citizens acquire information needed to make meaningful choices. The authors are calling on party leaders to commit to debates in 2020.
Researchers first organized a series of focus groups to ask voters and non-voters about the 2010 televised debates and what they hoped to gain from future debates. They came up with five demands or entitlements people said they needed from political debates to be democratic citizens:

They wanted to be addressed as if they were rational and independent decision-makers.
They wanted to be able to evaluate the claims made by debaters in order to make an informed voting decision.
They wanted to feel that they were in some way involved in the debate and spoken to by the debaters.
They wanted to be recognised by the leaders who claimed to speak for (represent) them.
They wanted to be able to make a difference to what happens in the political world.

The researchers then set out to determine how voters evaluated the 2015 debates in terms of meeting their needs. They noted that more than 30 percent of viewers of the first debatea full debate between all seven leaders of the main partiessaid they became more interested in the election campaign.
And of those who said after the election that their vote was influenced by a media source, almost half (48 percent) referred to the televised debates as being among the most helpfulthe highest percentage for any source of election information.

Tech and the presidentials: Hillary Clintons campaign is still angry about how Bernie Sanders campaign is talking about the NGP-VAN data breach, especially at insinuations suggesting that they too may have accessed data inappropriately, Jennifer Epstein reports for Bloomberg Politics.
NGP-VANs chief competitors, John Phillips of Aristotle and Jim Gilliam of NationBuilder, both sound off in this New York Times story by Emma Roller on the controversy. They argue that individual campaigns should control their own data, not parties. (Note to NYTimes editorswhen quoting competitors of a company, shouldnt they be described as such?)

Crypto wars: The best minds in the world cannot rewrite the laws of mathematics, Apple says in formal comments submitted to the British Parliament, which is considering legislation that would force the company and others to deliberately make their consumer products open to snooping. As David Sanger reports for the New York Times, the company is pushing back hard on arguments like that of FBI director James Comey: Some would portray this as an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement, it told the Parliament. Nothing could be further from the truth. Law enforcement today has access to more datadata which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justicethan ever before in the history of our world.

System reboot: The first Democratic presidential primary data war ended quickly, with the Democratic National Party officials restoring access to the national voter file to the Bernie Sanders campaign Saturday morning, and Sanders apologizing personally to Hillary Clinton at the start of Saturdays Democratic presidential debate. But as Bloomberg Politics Michael Bender, Jennifer Epstein and Andrew Harris report, the grudging settlement of the dispute came after a day of recriminations. That included the Sanders campaign suing the DNC in federal court, and the Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook charging that their data was stolen.
Indeed, it remains unclear whether the Sanders team actually took advantage of the temporary failure of NGP-VANs firewall to access actual lists of voters that the Clinton campaign had identified, or just summaries of those lists. As Pat Reynard writes for the Iowa Starting Line blog, the search logs made available by NGP-VAN show that Josh Uretsky, the fired Sanders data director, ran multiple searches for 40 minutes of Clinton turnout and persuasion scores in key early states which he calls an obvious attempt to glean valuable data from your rival. He adds, Running lists of turnout scores can tell you how many people the Clinton campaign believes will turn out to caucus. Querying their persuasion scores can get you a rough estimate of how many supporters they think they have in a state.
Heres DNC CEO Amy Daceys careful recounting of the steps the committee took as the news of the data breach spread.
Politicos Nancy Scola explains the history of NGP-VAN and why nearly every Democratic campaign uses it.
The Sanders campaign has suspended two additional staffers involved in accessing the Clinton campaigns data, Fredrik Schouten reports for USA Today.
The Clinton campaign is still highly vexed over the possibility that Sanders team got an unfair advantage from the data breach, as Clinton pollster Joel Benenson told Glenn Thrush and Annie Karnie of Politico. I dont think any of us will know until this audit is completed how serious this all is, Benenson said. All of [the data] is extremely valuable, it is work produced by tens of thousands of volunteers. ... it is part of a roadmap to how we are running and strategizing in our campaign and how we get to the totals we need to win in Iowa and New Hampshire, especially,
Top Democratic campaign veterans had lots to say about the controversy, though some of them were hardly objective observers. For example, former Obama 2012 national field director Jeremy Bird of 270 Strategies tweeted They stole millions of dollars of research. This isnt a small thing.
Jim Messina, who ran Obamas 2012 campaign, tweeted, Sanders camp reaction is silly. Fess up, apologize, and move on. Rule breakers arent victims. (Bird and Messina both worked for the Ready for Hillary Super PAC.)
Former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, now advising Uber, tweeted, Think if one company accessed and stole anothers customer data. This is no small thing. Sanders camp should be careful playing the victim. (Plouffe endorsed Clinton in October.)
Taking everything down a notch, Brigade VP Adam Conner (and a longtime Personal Democracy Media friend) writes a tongue-in-cheek version of All the Presidents Data. Best line comes from Carl Bernstein: So what exactly got stolen again? Some kind of files? How much paper are we talking here? Boxes? Enough to fill the van?
While the data war dies down, journalists and editorial writers looking for a larger lesson in what seems to be the ultimate inside baseball story might ponder this question: How do national voter files filled with fine-grained data points on the political preferences of hundreds of millions of voters, combined with sophisticated data analytics, change politics? Add in the psychographic modeling and behavioral targeting reportedly being perfected by Ted Cruzs campaign, and what role is left for ordinary citizens?
Political technologist Michael Marinaccio raises a bunch of related questions about whether big data in politics is going to far, giving this as one example of whats now possible: I sat in a recent meeting where we were discussing potential messages to use and were planning to segment two different audiences and send them similar, but opposing messages. (Newsflash: it is insanely normal these days to send your pro-life segment a Yes, Pro-life! message while sending your pro-choice crowd a Yes, Womens health! one.)
Why you have to read the small print: If you ever bought anything from the Delaware Crossing online Americana store, you may not realize it but you were shopping from the National Republican Campaign Committee, which now has your data, as Theodoric Meyer reports for Politico.
This is civic tech: Data scientist Dave Goldsmith shows how to use open data to reduce cycling deaths in Los Angeles.
Trump watch: If the short-fingered vulgarian wins the Republican presidential nomination, GOP stalwarts would likely rally behind a more establishment candidate running as an independent, longtime political observer Jeff Greenfield writes for Politico.

Welcome to the data-driven campaign: Bernie Sanders presidential campaign has lost its access to the Democratic partys 50-state voter file after its staff allegedly accessed internal voter data from Hillary Clintons campaign that became available while NGP-VAN, the company that manages the file on behalf of the party, was applying a software patch Wednesday, Rosalind Helderman, Anne Gearan, and John Wagnerr report for the Washington Post. The DNC has blocked Sanders use of the voter file until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed, they report. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says the campaign didnt download or print any data and is blaming NGP-VAN for the breach.
The Sanders campaign has fired one staffer involved in the incident, who accessed some modeling data from another campaign, its spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement. But, as Maggie Habermas and Nick Corasaniti report for the New York Times, ...according to three people with direct knowledge of the breach, there were four user accounts associated with the Sanders campaign that ran searches while the security of Mrs. Clintons data was compromised.
Covering the same news for BuzzFeed, Evan McMorris-Santoro and Ruby Cramer report that it was the Sanders staff that alerted NGP-VAN of the breakdown of its firewall between the campaigns. As they note, The incident could pose a devastating setback for Sanders so close to the start of the Democratic primary: Until access is restored to the NGP-VAN, the candidates organizers will have to perform the basic functions of the field programphone banks, voter contact, visibilitywithout an electronic system centralizing their efforts.
The staffer who was fired, Josh Uretsky, told CNNs Dan Merica that he wasnt trying to access any proprietary Clinton data, but just trying to understand how badly the Sanders campaigns data was exposed. He added, We knew there was a security breach in the data, and we were just trying to understand it and what was happening. To the best of my knowledge, nobody took anything that would have given the (Sanders) campaign any benefit....This wasnt the first time we identified a bad breach in the NGP-VAN system. In retrospect, I got a little panicky because our data was totally exposed, too. We had to have an assessment, and understand of how broad the exposure was and I had to document it so that I could try to calm down and think about what actually happened so that I could figure out how to protect our stuff.
NGP-VANs president Stu Trevelyan posts a statement this morning explaining that the data breach was quite limited. For a brief window, the voter data that is always searchable across campaigns in VoteBuilder included client scores it should not have, on a specific part of the VAN system. So for voters that a user already had access to, that user was able to search by and view (but not export or save or act on) some attributes that came from another campaign.
Former Obama campaign data director Ethan Roeder tells Civicist that Its becoming increasingly apparent to me, the more I learn about this story, that theres no there there, explaining that theres little information the Sanders campaign could have usefully gleaned from seeing some Clinton voter scores.
The DNCs decision to cut off the Sanders campaign access to the national voter file is highly unlikely to last long, in my humble opinion. If it does, it will undermine the confidence of many other lower level Democratic candidates in using NGP-VANs vaunted system. As Ben Jacobs writes for the Guardian, The move by the DNC raises eyebrows as many Democrats, including Sanders and fellow presidential candidate Martin OMalley, have long accused the DNCs chair, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, of attempting to rig the presidential process to benefit Clinton. In particular, they have raised questions about the relative paucity of debates, which have been scheduled for weekend evenings and to coincide with other events such as a major University of Iowa football game.
As Simon Rosenberg of the New Democratic Network tweeted this morning, [I] am not a Sanders supporter, but cutting off his campaign from data access after their own software errors an extreme act by DNC.

Multiple female employees have come forward with accusations. Perhaps most disturbing, they report that FitzGibbon was previously disciplined, but not fired, when accused of harassment while he was working at Fenton Communications. After the accusation and the firms investigation, other female employees came forward with similar harassment complaints, they report.

Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders Campaign Field Office In Nashua NH 09 by Michael Vadon
The political media is buzzing this morning over the news, first reported by the Washington Post, that the Democratic National Committee has suspended the Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns access to its national voter file, after its data director allegedly took advantage of a breach in the firewall keeping its data separate from other campaigns data to look at the Hillary Clinton campaigns voter models. The firewall problem was quickly reported by a Sanders staffer to NGP-VAN, the vendor that manages the valuable system, and Stu Trevelyan, NGP-VANs president, says this morning that its clients voter scores were briefly available across its system until the bug allowing the access was fixed, and no other data was available.
However, now the DNC is insisting that the Sanders campaign somehow prove that it didnt download any proprietary information from the Clinton campaign, something it denies doing. Sanders data director, Josh Uretsky, has been fired by the campaign, and tells CNN this morning that he was just trying to understand how badly the Sanders campaigns data was exposed and that it wasnt the first time we identified a bad breach in the NGP-VAN system. 
Losing ongoing access to the NGP-VAN system could hobble Sanders field organizing efforts as the campaign approaches the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primaries. But theres something out of whack about this story, as former Barack Obama 2008 and 2012 data director Ethan Roeder explains to Civicist. The truth is that theres very little advantage to be gained by the Sanders campaign from perusing its opponents voter modeling data, if indeed that is all that it was able to access. If, on the other hand, the Sanders team got its hands on, say, the actual list of voters Clintons team has identified has 1s in Iowameaning, the voters who are definitely planning to caucus for Hillaryit would have a clearer picture of its competition there.
Roeder tells me, As for the strategic value of the voter models, its very limited. Pretty much all presidential level campaigns, and certainly the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, build their own individual-level support models and they use the same data to do itage, gender, race, income, etc. I find it very doubtful that the Sanders campaign could learn anything truly new about the Clinton campaigns strategy through model scores. But even if they could, all indications here suggest that they couldnt even export these scores if they wanted to. Its becoming increasingly apparent to me, the more I learn about this story, that theres no there there.
Another Obama campaign veteran who asked for anonymity commented, It would be very hard to back out of a score to the actual logic behind the model but I suppose with enough scores on enough voters you could infer some thingsbut in the end after a ton of work, I bet it would just confirm what you already knew.  Seeing some counts on how many 1s Clinton has might be interesting or seeing where her support is distributed might give some insight into where to focus energy in your own caucus strategy, but honestly, if Bernies team needs that, they are all but dead.
Update: MoveOn.orgs director of analytics, Milan de Vries, says The DNC should immediately audit its vendor to ensure compliance. In the meantime, as it investigates the situation, it should restore full access to the Sanders campaign. If, in fact, the data is not secure, then access should be suspended for all campaigns until the problem is rectified. MoveOn has endorsed the Sanders campaign.
Midday Friday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver issued a statement that continued to push on NGP-VAN for running an insecure service, but also promising further disciplinary action against other staffers who may have accessed Clinton voter information in addition to Uretsky. Clearly, while that information was made available to our campaign because of the incompetence of the vendor, it should not have been looked at, he declared.
But Weaver also threatened to sue the DNC if it did not immediately restore the Sanders campaigns ability to access our own information, information which is the lifeblood of any campaign. He said, This is the information about our supporters, our volunteers, the lists of people we intend to contact in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere. This is information that we have worked hard to obtain. It is our information, not the DNCs.
He added, In other words, by their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign. This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign  one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.

Their international profitsnot to mention a substantial chunk of the U.S. economydepend on the free flow of information across borders. Foreign officials, political activists, and judges who limit these flows to protect their citizens from U.S. surveillance strike at the heart of these companies business models. The ECJs Safe Harbor ruling has now forced Washington to decide whether it values its unrestricted ability to spy on Europeans more than an open Internet and the economic well-being of powerful U.S. businesses.

There was no first-time-ever-for-a-digital-audience moment, as there was during the previous Democratic debate, but CNN and Facebook, hosts of last nights #GOPdebate, took advantage of several interactive toolsplus emojis.
CNN touted the thousands of people who stepped inside the cross-country Campaign Camper to record video questions for the candidates and the millions who weighed in on Facebook.
How many questions made it into the debate? Three.
While it was good to include different (and younger) voices, and the questions pushed the candidates for more nuance on their positions on refugees, military action against ISIS and how to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the use of regular people mainly reinforced the debate narrative. We need a more direct form of public engagement to drive different questions and to elicit more informative answers.
During the debate, viewers were encouraged to go to CNNs Facebook page to vote on such questions as Whats the greatest threat to U.S. security? and Did Trump do a good job defending his plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.? Facebook users could also answer How are you feeling about the debate right now? by selecting the appropriate smiley face, ranging from angry to excited (complete with double hearts!).

Sanders Trumps Trump:  CBS and Twitter, which teamed up for last months Democratic debate, worked together again last night, with Twitter providing real-time insights on CBSnews.com.
Heres the final analysis of the debate conversation, which Donald Trump won, the largest follower growth, which Sen. Bernie Sanders won (!), and the most tweeted momenta not-compliment from Trump to Bush. For more on the debate and the many mentions of the internet, read todays First Post at Civicist.
Plus: Are Twitter and Facebook improving the debate experience? It depends, writes Callum Borchers in the Washington Post. That is, of course, a well-rehearsed non-answer. But you should probably be used to that, given thats the kind of answer Bill from Reno and Susan from Carson City could very well elicit.
U.S. Debate Viewership Soars: Meanwhile, nearly 7 in 10 adults (69 percent) say they have watched at least some of the televised debates, according to a new Pew Research Center poll. That number is up from 43 percent in December 2007, the last time we saw contested nominations in both parties.
Almost two-thirds of viewers (65 percent) say the debates have been helpful in learning about the candidates. That finding is consistent among all age groups, though young adults under 30 are less likely than older adults to have watched a debate (58 percent compared to 72 percent).
Just over half (51 percent) of debate viewers have found the debates fun to watchwith liberal Democrats (57 percent) and conservative Republicans (59 percent) enjoying the debates the most. Yet only about a third (34 percent) say the campaign has focused on important policy debates, while 58 percent told Pew it has not. View the full report.
It May Never End: Donald Trump last night said he is totally committed to the Republican Party, but if he changes his mind again, he could remain part of the presidential debate field. If Trump makes an independent run, he would need to draw at least 15 percent support in national polls, writes Angela Grieling Keane at Bloomberg. The same goes for Sen. Bernie Sanders, though he has been consistent about not running as an independent.
Fifteen percent in this crazy year were in, its not entirely inconceivable that someone may come along, said Mike McCurry, co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Our job is to make sure the candidates Americans are considering for president are there on the stage.

Election 2016Rethinking DebatesSocial Media 







In early December, Airbnb made headlines by releasing some data on how people are using the companys platform in New York City.
In doing so, the company has provided an object lesson in the critical role that data plays (and will continue to play) in government regulation of private companies in the 21st century, and highlighted how ill-equipped governments are to obtain and use this data.
Airbnb and the State
Over the past year, the use of Airbnb to rent properties in New York has received intense scrutiny from government regulators because of suspicion that a non-trivial amount of rentals listed on the site were in violation of state or city rules. In late 2014, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman released a report examining Airbnb rentals in New York that concluded that most short-term rentals booked [through Airbnbs service] in New York violate the law.
The recent data release by Airbnb was meant to make good on a promise by the company in response to the Attorney Generals report to be open and transparent, and to underscore its contention that the vast majority of the users of its service do so in compliance with state and local laws.
From the start, the release of this data was viewed with skepticism by some journalists, activists, and others that closely watch the sharing economy. In order to view it, interested parties needed to make an appointment to review the data in person at Civic Hall, where Airbnb is an organizational member. The data was highly redacted, was not published to companys data website, and those viewing it were not allowed to copy it to review it more closely after their scheduled appointment.
In the weeks that followed the release, outside reviews of the data seem to contradict Airbnbs primary claim that most of its hosts are using the service lawfully. Others have cited the need for more detailed information to draw definitive conclusions. Though Airbnb has indicated that it would like to share similar data on usage for other cities, there is no indication that the company will release more detailed information for New York City.
It seems clear that the ultimate question of whether Airbnbs service is being used lawfully will be determined by examining data on how people use the service. State regulators and others know this and have used legal and other means to try and get this data. Airbnb also knows this, and it has carefully constructed its limited release of data (and its public outreach about this data release) to assert that they are in compliance with the law.
But if data is at the heart of governments ability to regulate Airbnb and other sharing economy companies, why are they so ill-equipped to obtain and use it?
Regulating the Sharing Economy
At its core, the sharing economywhether defined by the example of Uber, Airbnb, or one of the other standard-bearers of this emerging class of businessrepresents a change in the way that people consume goods and services that is enabled by advances in technology. This change in consumption results in a challenge to an existing, entrenched market actor (for Uber, the taxi industry; for Airbnb, the hotel industry) that is subject to existing government taxes and regulations.
The challenge for public officials and regulators is to avoid stifling new innovation that can result in better services but at the same time to ensure the fair and equitable application of rules that have been set up to regulate business operations and protect consumers. This is an issue that can have significant political implications. Striking the proper balance between competing needs can indeed be tricky.
But this challenge is not a new one for governmentstension between regulators and private interests spans the history of collective governance.
Supporters of the sharing economy commonly criticize existing government regulations as outdated and ill-suited to support innovation by 21st century technology companies. Reputation systems are often pointed to as a 21st century alternative to traditional government regulation, to ensure that sharing economy firms and similar types of companies act in the best interest of consumers.
But there are a number of common examples where consumers engage in transactions for which they have an abundance of reputational information where the company providing the services is also highly regulated by government. Consider the example of dining out at a restaurantnever before have consumers had as much information as we do now about the quality and cleanliness of food service establishments. And yet, restaurants and food service establishments are highly regulated by multiple levels of government.
In addition, recent research specifically examining reputation systems used by technology companies suggests that reputation systems and more traditional central regulation can work beneficially in tandem. A recent study from the Ohio State University examined the reputation system used by eBay in conjunction with a buyer protection programa centrally managed program to provide protections to buyers and recourse if they are dissatisfied with purchases (an approach strikingly similar to the notion of centralized regulation). The study concluded that:
[W]e estimate that the total welfare rises by 2.9% after the introduction of the buyer protection program. This increased welfare demonstrates an efficiency gain by having the two mechanisms, the eBay Buyer Protection and eBay Top-Rated Sellers, in place. [Emphasis added]
Sharing economy supporters also claim the the growth of companies like Airbnb, Uber, Taskrabbit and others has led to a fundamental change in the economy, with more people opting to become freelancers whoto paraphrase the words of sharing economy companiesbecome masters of their own destiny. But another recent study from George Mason University suggests that the freelancer phenomenon began long before the advent of sharing economy companies like Airbnb and Uber:
Our data support the claim that there has been an increase in nontraditional employment, but the data refute the idea that this increase is caused by the sharing-economy firms that have arisen since 2008. Instead, we view the rise of sharing-economy firms as a response to a stagnant traditional labor sector and a product of the growing independent workforce.
The George Mason study helps to clarify the role that sharing economy companies can play in a changing economyas opportunities for traditional employment become scarcer, the sharing economy may play an important role in providing employment for a changing workforce.
But we should not allow these potential benefits to be offset by other negative consequences that may arise if sensible regulations are not applied sharing economy companies.
Information Asymmetry
The exercise of regulating private interests by government almost always involves an information asymmetry. Governments seek to discover the occurrence of specific activities that are subject to regulation and to apply relevant rules and taxes to those activities.
Prior to the digital age, governments sought to (and still seek to) address this asymmetry by hiring groups of trained employees like auditors, inspectors and agents. The job of these individuals is to investigate certain kinds of activities and transactions to determine if the activity in question falls under the authority of a specific regulation or regulating entity, and then to enforce any applicable rules or taxes.
With the rise of the internet and the dawn of the digital age, governments have employed a wide range of new tools to help ensure that the activities of private interests comply with rules that have been adopted by elected and appointed bodies. The steady march of technical advancement has also made compliance with government mandated taxes and rules easier and more efficient for businesses than ever before.
The tension between how technology alters production and consumption patterns, and how these new patterns square with existing government rules is not new.
In the 1960s, the rise of mail order retailers began a protracted debate on the application of state and local sales taxes to remote salesa debate that has raged through the time when internet retailers like Amazon developed and flourished, and that still rages today.
In the early 2000s, a new class of businessbolstered by the increasing availability of broadband internet accessbegan to offer consumers new options for telecommunication services that bypassed the Publicly Switched Telephone Network. In a scenario that is remarkably similar to the sharing economy, these new VoIP companies competed against large entrenched industry incumbents that were heavily regulated by government by offering customers improved service, a better customer experience, and lower prices.
The tension between the new service being offered to consumers VoIP companies and existing government rules was ultimately resolved by an order from the FCC.
So while the tension with existing tax and regulatory requirements created by technical advances is not new, and existing government institutions have shown they are capable of resolving these tension to the benefit of consumers, things are a little different when we consider the companies that make up the sharing economy.
Sharing economy companies self identify as technology companiesnot dispatch companies (in the case of Uber) or hoteliers (in the case of Airbnb) that happen to make heavy use of internet technologies. They position themselves not as providers of a service, but as enablers or connectors that bring together individuals that want to transact with each other.
The issue with respect to government regulations as they relate to sharing economy companies is not so much that existing regulations are outdated as some have claimed. Instead, it is that the infrastructure for ensuring compliance with these regulations was not constructed for the 21st centuryor, at best, the infrastructure has been minimally and very unevenly built.
Government regulations need to speak the native language of these companiesin the 21st century, this language is almost always data in JSON or CSV format delivered over HTTP.
A New Infrastructure for Regulation
Consider Airbnbs recent data releasewhat if the State of New York, as part of its request to the company to share data, had offered Airbnb the ability to publish data to its open data portal?
The state could have provided the company with a user account and requested that they publish their data using that account at regular intervals to allow for scrutiny by regulators and other interested parties. They could have provided Airbnb with existing guidelines for ensuring privacy as well as metadata guidelines to help ensure data quality.
Even if Airbnb didnt opt to publish data to the states open data portal, the request to do so would have helped to better qualify the deficiencies in the data the company actually did release. The states portal already contains scores of data sets with detailed information from dozens of agencies. Are technology companies like Airbnb less equipped to publish data on their core business operations than the State Liquor Authority? Really?
With very few exceptions, government open data portals are one-way vehiclestransporting data unidirectionally from government agencies to external consumers. Governments largely dont view their open data portals as platforms for comingling data from different data producers, much less as vital instruments for successful 21st century regulation.
But what if they did?
With complete enough data, the question of whether an Airbnb host is in compliance with the law is fairly easy to spot. The issue is that in the absence of a standard mechanism for sharing this data openly, companies like Airbnb can define their own terms for behaving in an open and transparent way.
We need to expand the way we think about open data so that its not just about agencies publishing data to an open data portal, but instead is an integral way that we collectively help ensure the health and stability of our communities. We need to expand our notion of government as a platform to go beyond just building new civic apps to helping ensure efficient compliance with rules that are adopted collectively through democratic processes.
Weve started to assemble some of the building blocks for this new infrastructure, but we now need to put the pieces in place.
For example, some governments publish data on zoning rules as open data. But we need to go beyond simply publishing this data and expose these rules through an interface that allow them to be encapsulated in a transaction. This work has only just begun and is,for now,largely driven by actors outside of government.
Imagine an infrastructure that would allow companies like Airbnb to instantly determine if a potential short-term rental was authorized under local zoning and rental regulations, and to determine if a rental tax was due on the transaction and the amount.
We are woefully short of this goal.
In fact, in jurisdictions that specifically require short-term renters to register with the local government, there is no interface that supports an automated check to determine if a specific property has a permit and is authorized to conduct such a rental. The absence of this essential infrastructure to enforce local regulations may go a long way toward explaining the dismal rate of compliance.
It seems clear that governments will not be able to successfully regulate these new companies without the infrastructure necessary to do so.
Building the infrastructure for 21st century regulation will require us to expand our ideas of open data and government as a platform. Checking for compliance with tax and regulatory requirementsby either party in a sharing economy transactionshould be as simple as making an API call.
Constructing this infrastructure wont be done overnight, and it probably wont be inexpensive. But the stakes for state and local governments have never been higher.

Hacking Star Wars: Were interrupting this mornings programming for an urgent message: The U.S. Rebel Alliance is real. And as Civic Halls civic imagination fellow Andrew Slack explains in this new post for Civicist, as we speak, the dream life of Star Wars and the waking life of politics is merging. And heres a new video starring Mark Ruffalo, Darren Criss, Heather McGhee (of Demos), Baratunde Thurston (of the Daily Show), and a host of YouTube stars, explaining more.
While were on the topic of culture hacking, heres Cats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber with his version of RepubliCATS.
And heres actor Mandy Patinkin, taking issue with how GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is embracing his role in The Princess Bride.
Tech and the presidentials: The internet was mentioned a whopping 18 times during last nights GOP presidential debate, but if you were paying attention and know anything about tech, you were probably cringing most of the time.
With millions of people watching last nights GOP presidential debate, Twitter reports that the candidates who gained the most followers during the debates first hour were, in order: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz. You read that right: Bernie Sanders, a Democrat who wasnt in the debate, gained more followers than every other Republican candidate save Trump. (If you watched the debate live online at CBS News site, you saw these insights in real-time, by the way.)
Since you wont find out most of these things from watching debates, the New York Times Interactive department has built a nifty tool for finding out where the presidential candidates stand on a host of top national issues.
Net neutrality opponent Marco Rubio has now added his name to a letter attacking the FCC for trying to help municipalities set up their own publicly-run internet services, Brian Fung of the Washington Post reports.
If you doubt the impact of Citizens United on this presidential election cycle, check out this one stat: Super PACs and other independent groups have run 35,743 TV ads on broadcast and cable TV, compared to just 291 by traditional advocacy groups, Matea Gold reports for the Washington Post.
Brave new world: Google and Facebook could face huge fines amounting to billions of dollars if they fail to comply with tough new European Union privacy rules, Elizabeth Weise reports for USA Today.
Security researchers found a huge hole in Targets gift-registry app, one that allowed anyone to access reams of personal information, Dan Goodin reports for ArsTechnica.
FBI Director James Comey testified yesterday on Capitol Hall, calling on tech companies to change their business models and stop providing their customers with encryption by default, Dan Froomkin and Jenna McLaughlin report for The Intercept. Told by Senator Mike Lee that encrypted apps would still exist, Comey acknowledged that the sophisticated user could still find a way.

Kamua Bell explains the #WhitesAgainstTrump movement, which has started trending on Twitter.
What sharing economy? Quartzs Alison Griswold reports on the continuing controversy over Airbnbs business practices, centering her account on the companys hyper-controlled approach to data transparency in New York City (they are offering limited viewing hours to internal spreadsheets at a data room they occasionally set up here at Civic Hall). The best line in the piece goes to NYC council member Helen Rosenthal, an Airbnb critic. She tells Griswold, When I met with Chris Lehane (Airbnbs recently appointed head of policy and a former Bill Clinton aide), he said flat out that he did not agree with our laws. I did not realize that a $25 billion company can just decide which laws they do and do not agree with.
Richie Ross, a veteran labor organizer who worked under Cesar Chavez, is championing legislation in California that would enable gig workers to self-organize and negotiate with the companies whose apps they are working through, George Skelton reports for the Los Angeles Times. He notes, astutely, that Ross legislation is unlikely to pass, since business wants to keep these workers exploitable as independent contractors and labor unions want them redefined as traditional employees subject to current labor laws.

First Post 







The biggest pop culture moment in memory is upon us. The Wall Street Journal estimates that the opening of Star Wars Episode VII: the Force Awakens could be the highest-grossing release of all time. As the Journal reports, the movie is expected to attract hard-core fans who will go to multiple screenings and casual moviegoers who rarely go to the multiplex, along with senior citizens who remember seeing the original in 1977 and their grandchildren who first glimpsed Darth Vader on YouTube.
Some theaters are staying open round the clock to handle the expected demand. Some economists are even worried that the economy will suffer from the aggregate of people skipping out of work to go see the film. Other movie studios are nervous that their holiday movies will be forgotten. There is a growing fear in Hollywood that the first Star Wars movie in a decadeand one that returns stars including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher to roles they havent played since 1983isnt comparable to any film that has come before, the Journal reports.
We Americans find Star Wars dreamyjust look at this fan artin the most compelling way possible. A way that can move us to action. As I have come to understand after a decade of work spinning activism from the silk of our fantasies, while we personally dream at night, our collective culture dreams through books and movies and stories. Working with those stories is cultural dream work.
At the moment, there is only one other blockbuster competing for our attention, one whose stakes seem to be getting higher every day: the 2016 presidential election. And though American politics feels increasingly surreal with each passing decade, the election is not part of our dream life, but our waking one. The kind of excitement we are seeing in the mass rallies for both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders suggests that here, too, there is an energy that could be a true blockbuster. The GOP debate in September was CNNs most watched program ever and yesterdays debate undoubtedly also drew in tens of millions.
Why are so many people flocking to Trump or Sanders? Despite their deep differences on values and policy, maybe theres a common reason: millions of Americans have come to believe that they are shut out of the political process by wealthy elites. Trump voters appear to hate the elites more; Sanders voters appear to loathe the wealthy more. But either way, the passion swirling around their campaigns is also suggestive of a search for something we seem to be losing: a sense that the people who actually run America are no longer listening to ordinary people.
For ten years, I have worked to drive new kinds of civic engagement by figuring out where the psychological energy may be blocked in the culture, and then moving to release that energy in positive ways. I call this cultural acupuncture. Stories like the Star Wars mythos are the proverbial needles; stories, not dry facts, are what resonate. Stories are what can expand our civic imagination and allow us a transformed sense of agency.
Im now proposing to test that theory by launching the U.S. Rebel Alliance. Working with groups like the Harry Potter Alliance, Civic Hall, Culture Labs, Funny or Die, and over 40 other amazing partner organizations aiming to ride the wave of excitement for the return of the force to see if Americans can be called into greater action to save their real Republic. (By the way, were not the only people looking to hack Star Wars to help shift the political culturea whole bunch of so-called conservatives, from William Kristol to the Washington Free Beacons editor Matthew Continetti, have been joking about actually rooting for the Empire and arguing, I kid you not, that the destruction of Alderaan by the Death Star was justified and not a war crimesomething my close friend and I wrote a rebuttal on here).

As we speak, the dream life of Star Wars and waking life of politics are merging. One of historys most popular authors, JK Rowling tweeted she believes Trump is so evil, that even in her deepest imagination she could not come up with someone as terrifying. Darth Trump is spreading on YouTube at Ludicrous Speed. This is not to mention that Ted Cruzs campaign is offering a chance to see the film with Cruz (and they have him with a light saber). Bernie Sanders fans are saying, Youre my only hope, libertarians are comparing Obama to the Emperor, and the internet is chock full of Star Wars Hillary Clinton memes that truly cross into the surreal.
The force of psychological energy for effective cultural acupuncture runs strong when Star Wars meets American politics. And heres how we think Star Wars can help us build a real U.S. Rebel Alliance, spoken in the vernacular of the movie but written against the backdrop of our political reality:
We need to defeat the Empire of Big Money so that we may live in a Republic that is of, by, and for the Forcethe Force of interconnectivity that is We The People, when all of our voices are heard.
Right now, the Empire of Big Money has struck back against We the People, silencing our voices with the force choke of Darth Vader. It is up to us, to step up as Jedi-in-training and join the U.S. Rebel Alliance, the way Luke starts his journey in A New Hope. Remember, when Obi Wan invites him to get off of the outer rim planet of Tattoine, he is resistant:
Look, I cant get involved. Ive got work to do. Its not that I like the Empire; I hate it, but theres nothing I can do about it right now... Its all such a long way from here.
Similarly, 84 percent of Americans polled believe that the Empire of Big Money is a problem but probably less than 1 percent feels agency to do something about it. It is time to awaken the Force of We The People and that is what we intend to do with the U.S. Rebel Alliance.
In the United States, we are 330 million people, all of us heroes waiting in the wings, wishing to go an epic journey but nervous to take on the Empire. And while activists work on issues around gun laws, taxes, climate, religion, racial justice, and economic equality, its pretty clear that regardless of where we stand on these issues, should any of us want to be effective on them, we need to recognize that the Empire standing in our way is Big Money.
To paraphrase both Joseph Campbell (whose concepts profoundly influenced the writing of Star Wars) and Ben Cohen from Ben and Jerrys: if you want to understand what empire you are living in, look to the tallest building in the city. In the 1400s in Western Europe, the tallest building was the Church. By the time of the American Revolution, the tallest building became the political palace, the nation state. By the end of the 20th century, the tallest building in the city became the multinational corporation in the financial district.
We now have an empire that is of, by, and for the corporations. The Empire of Big Money. In the words of one presidential candidate, Congress does not govern Wall Street. Wall Street governs Congress.
But it doesnt have to be this way. As the saying goes, it is far, far better to light even the smallest candle than to curse the darkness. This past November, both Maine and Seattle won ballot initiatives setting up small-donor public financing systems. We the People spoke up against the Empire; candles were lit. Regardless of the Empires Dark Side, we can spread the light of those candles across our Republic. And that is what we are doing with the U.S. Rebel Alliance.
We are asking people to sign the Jedi Pledge to end the Empire of Big Money, to share this video starring Mark Ruffalo, Heather McGhee (head of Demos), Darren Criss (star of Glee), Baratunde Thurston (The Daily Show), and more. This Sunday from 7pm ET to 10pm ET, were holding a live webcast to geek out about the new film, and well be holding a meme contest on fighting Darth Money.

By signing the Pledge, thats all just the warm up. As we roll out on Twitter as @usrebelalliance, as well as on Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube, youll hear about actions to get President Obama and the candidates to sign the Jedi pledge and use that to create accountability. We want to help make the very needed issue of Big Money center stage in the U.S. primary. Imagine getting the debate moderators to ask the candidates, A lot of Americans are comparing Star Wars to the Empire of Big Money. If the Death Star is as they suggest, made by Darth Money and Super Pacs, how do you respond?
In defiance of the notion that serious topics must only be addressed seriously, we are aiming to turn this winter into a Star Wars U.S. Rebel Alliance party to create change. We plan to use storytelling through social media, guerilla theater actions, and even U.S. Rebel Alliance hotlines in a where we are the heroes in a real world choose your own adventure.
But You are Our Only Hope! We want your ideas on strategy regarding the larger campaign, social media, guerilla theater, pragmatic asks, and more. We want to work with you on how to get people who have never been engaged in civic life to be working alongside veteran activists.
It is time for the franchise that brought us Obi Wan Kenobi to invite 330 million American heroes waiting in the wings to go on an adventure that balances the Force of We the People. It is an adventure to bring down the Empire of Money in politics while lifting up the heroic agency that flows deep in each of us. It is time to make good on our childhood dreams of becoming the heroes in films like Star Wars.
May we use the common thread of Star Wars to Awaken the Force that is We the People. May our light emerge from the Dark Side and the Empire. And #MayTheForceBeWithUS.

Civic EngagementElection 2016Organizing 




Government as its own worst enemy: The Government Accountability Office has found that the EPA engaged in covert propaganda when it rolled out a social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Thunderclap to battle public opposition to its clean water rule, Eric Lipton and Michael Shear report for the New York Times front page. While government agencies are allowed to promote their policies as long as their role in doing so is disclosed, the GAO found that using Thunderclap violated the law because as the promoted Thunderclap message spread online across Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, people receiving wouldnt have known it came from the EPA. I can guarantee you that general counsels across the federal government are reading this report, Michael Eric Hertz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, commented. And thats not a good thing for everyone who wants government to open up more by using social media.
The GAO says (on page 13 of its letter to Senator Jim Inhofe, who requested its investigation into the EPA) the problem with how the agency used Thunderclap is that While EPAs role was transparent to supporters who joined the campaign [by signing up for the Thunderclap], this does not constitute disclosure to the 1.8 million people potentially reached by the Thunderclap. To those people, it appeared that their friend independently shared a message of his or her support for EPA and clean water. This is a truly odd way to think about how information spreads today thanks to the online public sphere: back in pre-internet days, if the Surgeon General said smoking was dangerous to your health, and then some random person used that same phrase in a newspaper story or a conversation over the office water cooler, no one thought that was covert propaganda. It was just the effect of an idea spreading, one that happened to come from an authoritative government source.
The GAO also slammed the EPA for a blog post about the impact of clean water on surfers and brewers by a communications staffer that including links to two advocacy organizations (the NRDC and the Surfrider Foundation) who were themselves supportive of the clean water rule. Both of those third-party sites included calls to take action, including buttons that would take a user through the process of contacting Congress, leading the GAO to conclude that the EPA had violated anti-lobbying provisions of relevant legislation.
Both of these rulings by the GAO are likely to chill government communications offices and cause them to pull back from engaging in the online public sphere. Lets hear it for nitpicky government lawyers. Its worth remembering that back in 2008, when questions arose about the Department of Defenses years-long plying of retired military officers with special conference calls, meetings, paid travel and privileged access to senior Pentagon officials, all in service of helping to generate favorable news coverage of the Bush administrations war efforts, the GAO found that there was no evidence of any covert propaganda effort, since the Pentagon didnt specifically contract with or pay those retired officers for positive commentary. (The fact that many of these same ex-officers were simultaneously employed by major defense contractors as lobbyists was deemed beyond the scope of the GAOs investigation, as was the fact that the Pentagon spent millions to carefully track what they said to media outlets.)
So, just to be clear: if a government agency gets Americans to voluntarily share its message on social media and doesnt disclose in every instance of that messages appearance that it came from the agency, thats covert propaganda according to the Government Accounting Office. But if a government agency gets Americans to voluntarily share its message in news media and doesnt disclose in every instance that they wined and dined these Americans, who they handpicked because they knew they already shared the agencys point of view, thats...just fine.
While were pissed off at government, department of: The Internet Archives Brewster Kahle has posted an angry open letter to the National Credit Union Administration, announcing the voluntary liquidation of his Internet Credit Union project, and its quite a doozy.
Tech and the presidential: It will be interesting to see how the presidential candidates try to insinuate themselves into this weeks big cultural event, the release of the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens. Already, Ted Cruz is calling on users of his mobile engagement app to step up their volunteering in the hopes of winning tickets to see the film opening weekend. Cruz tells ABC News, I grew up on Star Wars. I collected all the Star Wars action figures, I had them all in a Darth Vader carrying case and with my friends we would play and fight them back and forth. I had a giant millennium falcon.
By the way, now that we know that everything the Cruz campaign does is shaped by behavioral scientists testing the effects of different messages on targeted audiences, it becomes possible to read his campaign moves in a whole new way. Call it reverse engineering of data targeting. Thus, last weeks New York Times story by Matt Flegenheimer about Cruzs efforts in Iowa to Make Friends with Ordinary People becomes more understandable. As Flegenheimer reported, While many candidates stick to their stump speech script, a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated, down to the dramatic pauses deployed identically from event to event. He is folksy by memorization, ticking off tales of college football woe or a drawling West Texas farmer with the precision of mass repetition.
This Des Moines Register story by Jennifer Jacobs suggests that Donald Trumps ground game in the state may be faltering, though it is using the Ground Game 2 mobile canvassing app.

Tech and the presidential: Ted Cruzs presidential campaign is now openly bragging about its use of psychographic data for voter micro targeting, as Tom Hamburger reports for the Washington Post. Using data from peoples Facebook profiles along with consumer data, the campaign tailors its outreach to individuals with care. Hamburger writes, For example, personalities that have received high scores for neuroticism are believed to be generally fearful, so a pro-gun pitch to them would emphasize the use of firearms for personal safety and might include a picture of a burglar breaking in to a home. He also nicely notes this: Cruz, a critic of excessive government data collection, has been notably aggressive about gathering personal information for his campaign.
Hate search: Using weekly Google search data from 2004 to 2013, Evan Soltas and Seth Stephens-Davidowitz write that they found a direct correlation between anti-Muslim searches and anti-Muslim hate crimes. They also estimate that negative attitudes against Muslims today are higher than prejudice against any group in any month since 2004, when Google began preserving detailed data on search volumes. The only silver lining in all their findings: after President Obama mentioned that Muslims in America include many top athletes and soldiers, searches on those word combinations also spiked.
Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, posts on Medium that Lets not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world.
Monica Potts story for The New Republic on homelessness in Palo Alto is powerful and heartbreaking.
What open government? Steve Adler, chief information strategist of IBM, writes that, despite being a big fan of the Open Government Partnership (OGP)a signature international transparency initiative galvanized by the Obama Administratonthe entire project needs a reboot. He adds, We are increasing membership but not increasing open government, and civil society is increasingly cynical about OGP. Many are saying it is a whitewash, lipstick on a pig, giving national governments a nice pretty facade of openness behind which they write laws restricting access to executive emails, forbidding foreign funding of journalism, empowering universal surveillance, and even worse. And he asks some really good questions, like Why is an organization dedicated to transparency having secret leadership meetings?
Watching their words: Angie Drobnic Holan, a fact-checker with Politifact, offers some tantalizing evidence that the online fact-checking movement is having an impact on politicians, with some vetting their prepared statements more carefully and giving their campaign ads extra scrutiny, and media organizations highlighting fact-checking in their coverage because so many people click on fact-checking stories after a debate or high-profile news event.
This is civic tech: A boycott app named Bingdela has taken Taiwan by storm, giving Taiwanese a way to vent their anger at a court ruling clearing a major manufacturer of a food scandal, Paul Mazur reports for the New York Times.

Castle Square in Warsaw (Wikipedia)

The poster child for European integration seems more like a moody teenager.
This sentence, from last weeks issue of The Economist, refers to Poland, which was under the Communist Regime until 1989 and only joined the European Union in 2004.
In the past six months, the country went through a significant power shift that saw the populist Law and Justice party take control of the Polish political scene: last May, their candidate Andrzej Duda, a lawyer and former MEP, was elected President. Just a few months later, in October, the party won the absolute majority in the Parliamentary elections, a first for the 26-year old democracy.
But in less than a month, the new government has prompted many people to take to the streets to protest the partys first, very controversial steps towards controlling the judicial power.
Polands ruling party misunderstood its democratic mandate is the message spread by the We Are Watching You coalition (in Polish: Patrzymy na Was), an informal, nonpartisan group of citizens, many of whom are active in non-governmental organizations, including Panoptykon Foundations Katarzyna Szymielewicz and Jakub Gornicki, of Fundacja ePanstwo, a partner of Personal Democracy Media and the organizer of the Personal Democracy Forum PL-CEE.
The group has been leading protests in the capital, Warsaw, as well as in other cities, calling for democratic standards, human rights, and the rule of law in Poland: the governments actions, they claim, are seriously endangering the separation of powers in the country.
Checks and balances
The political clash started when the new parliament voted in five new judges of the Polish Constitutional Court (the highest judicial authority of the country) taking advantage of a legal conundrum.
But the critical point was reached when, as reported by Associated Press, President Duda quickly swore in four of them in the middle of the night before the court itself could rule on the validity of the earlier appointments by the previous government.
The controversial road that the Law and Justice party (in Polish: Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc, abbreviated in PiS) is taking, had been paved by the previous government, led by the more moderate Civic Platform party, that had elected both the previous President and Prime Minister.
At Politico Europe, law professor Maciej Kisilowski explains:
Because of scheduled retirements, as many as five slots on the courtone-third of the total makeup of 15opened around election time. Three judges retired in early November, a few days before the new parliament convened, but after the election day. The remaining two will step down in early December.
In an aggressively partisan way, Civic Platform passed a law allowing the outgoing parliament to choose all five judges. Last Thursday, the Constitutional Court decided the law was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the election of two December judges. The other three judges, however, were chosen properly and, in early November, should have started their term in office.
On December 3rd, the Constitutional Court ruled that three of those earlier appointments were valid, but two were not.
Whore you gonna call? A SuperCitizen!
At the moment, the political opposition to the Law and Justice party is also protesting in streets and squares. We Are Watching You, though, is not built on political partisanship, but rather on civic action, Gornicki tells Civicist.
Jakub Gornicki is a journalist, open data advocate, and longtime civic activist at Fundacja ePanstwo. We spoke via Skype on Thursday morning, before a meeting of the We Are Watching You coalition.
We are not against this government, he says, but against the standards its setting.
Currently, the citizens coalition is choosing to organize and disseminate information through social media and not to have leaders.
This appears to be both a strategy and a necessity: given the deeply polarized public debate, which is reflected in the mainstream media, not putting anyone as the face and voice of the protest will make it harder for the government-supporting media to attack people in the coalition and undermine their stances, Gornicki explains.
Instead, they have created the figure of the SuperCitizen (in Polish: SuperObywatel) as a voice to share information while emphasizing the civic aspect of their protest.

Who is the SuperCitizen? Heres how he/she is described on the coalition website:
The SuperCitizen [...] draws its power from the Constitution and from human rights. [...] She knows what rights are and is not afraid to use them. She avoids political disputes, because she knows that it divides rather than unite, it breaks things, instead than repairing them. For her, the most important things are standards and she expect them to be implemented by all officiating authority or those who are in opposition.
In the video of one of the protests, people shout Constitution! and Democracy! and wave signs that mean freedom of expression and freedom of information.
The voiceover says Citizens have to exercise their rights.
Many members of the coalition, though speaking in a personal capacity, are active in non-governmental organizations and have a long record of defending human rights: therefore, Gornicki explains, they are used to scrutinizing the actions of every government, criticizing if necessary, and always try to create a dialogue with them.
But the president broke the law and now it seems impossible to talk with the government, he adds.
The active citizens that form the coalition are also worried about the new course of the ruling party for soon-to-come reforms. In their public statement, they write:
...it only seems to be the beginning of a total makeover of various areas of public and private life. PiS has announced immediate adoption of the new anti-terrorist law. Another change expected within a month will affect public media, focusing their role on promoting national values. PiS is also planning major changes in Polands social and educational policy, including rolling back school reform as well as introducing financial benefits for parents with two children or more, the latter involving collection of sensitive data in a central database of all beneficiaries.
It is not clear whats next.
Currently, a petition on Change.org has about 2,000 signaturesbut this might not mean much: even if citizens were able to gather signatures for a referendum on these issues (the law in Poland requires one million signatures from a population of 38.5 million), such referendum would still have to be approved by the Parliament to happensomething that does not seem likely to happen, given the absolute majority that the Law and Justice party holds.
On Thursday night, when I asked the activists if there were any expected developments or actions set for the weekend, one of them half-jokingly replied: With the extremely dynamic situation we have here in Poland you never know whats gonna happen in next few hours.
On Friday morning, Civicist was informed that the government is refusing to print the Constitutional Court ruling in the official gazette, therefore confirming that it will not acknowledge as legal the decision of the highest court in the country.
The center-left leaning newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reports:
Yesterday the President of the Constitutional Court President Andrew Rzeplinski confirmed to us that Minister Kemp [Beata Kemp is the Justice Minister, elected with the Law and Justice party] sent him a letter in which it informs that the publication of the judgment in the Official Gazette is paused because it was issued by improperly constituted court and is therefore invalid.
As the only option seems to be taking the protest to the streets again, Gornicki makes clear that We Are Watching You will keep being a strictly civic force, independent from media and political parties: Its better for us to build a movement, he concludes.

Tech and the presidentials: Ted Cruzs presidential campaign, now surging, is using a data analytics firm whose prime product is a database of millions of Facebook users whose profile information was harvested largely without their permission, Harry Davies reports for The Guardian. The firm, Cambridge Analytica, which specializes in behavioral microtargeting, claims to be able to match Facebook data to existing voter data. Its Facebook database was reportedly obtained by an academic who paid Mechanical Turk users to let him access their Facebook profiles, which allowed him not only to harvest their personal data and likes, but also those of their friends.
The ACLUs chief technologist, Christopher Soghoian, said the Guardians findings were troubling, adding, What it essentially means is there is no one regulating campaigns privacy data and security practices. So it means you have a wild west, where the campaigns can do whatever they want and get away with it. Its worth noting that in 2012, the Obama campaign built a similar (but much larger) dataset of Facebook users through its Im in app and Targeted Sharing project.
A coalition of liberal and Muslim advocacy groups organized by online advocacy group CREDO Action are calling on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to back away from retired General Wesley Clark, a campaign surrogate who recently called for the internment of some American Muslims, Alex Seitz-Wald reports for MSNBC.com.

As Twitters director of news Adam Sharp told her, For 55 years, weve all been yelling at the screens in presidential debates...This is really the first time the screen talked back.
Media and democracy: If, as Craig Newmark of Craigslist likes to say, the media are the immune system of democracy, then this article by Marc Levy in the Cambridge Day, decisively debunking an attack on a local Muslim city councillor by Breitbart.com, is a great example. Were going to need a lot of this kind of journalism, because anti-Muslim hysteria in America has never been greater. Notably, the Breitbart story appeared in the sponsored news feeds of many Cambridge residents, suggesting that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergs promise to defend Muslims may need a little work.

Well, not all people. I wonder if Pfeiffer knows about GoFundMes refusal to let women use the site to fund abortions, while permitting pro-life campaigners to use it to raise money for their causes.
Oh, yeah. Remember Meerkat?

This is Christine Cupaiuolos first report for the Rethinking Debates project. While the vast majority of stories will be about the ways that debate producers around the world are experimenting with using interactive technology and social media to make these events more meaningful and responsive to public concerns, this story highlights an unexpected breakthrough here in the United States: the first time in which a member of the viewing public was able to talk back virtually to the candidates in real-time.
Political debate watchers in the United States have been offered more ways than ever this year to view the presidential primary debates and to interact with the host networks and the candidates.
Yet after six debatesfour Republican and two Democratand tens of thousands of questions submitted via Facebook and Instagram, real-time opinion meters and polls, streaming Twitter reactions, live coverage on Snapchat, and livestreaming in virtual reality, only one attempt to engage the public broke through the wall dividing candidates and viewers.
It happened Nov. 14 during the Democratic debate in Iowa, when a real-time comment on Twitter was posed to a candidate. While it took all of eight minutes for debate organizers to select, vet, and read on air a #DemDebate tweet rebuking presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, it could be argued that the lead-up took decades.
For 55 years, weve all been yelling at the screens in presidential debates, said Adam Sharp, head of News, Government and Elections at Twitter. This is really the first time the screen talked back.
CBS, host of the first-ever televised presidential debate in 1960, teamed up with Twitter for the event at Drake University, marking the first time the social media platform was an official partner in a U.S. debate (Twitter has advised other networks hosting debates).
The two media companies started working in tandem over the summer, said Sharp, testing out curation methods during the other networks debates and building on ways Twitter has been used in previous election cycles and in other countries.
Past debates, for example, may have included a counter showing number of tweets per minute. This time around, online viewers saw a graphic cycling through the volume of conversation as well as each candidates share of the conversation. Visuals also captured the topics people were tweeting about and debate moments that drove conversation (here are the top moments). Twitter collaborated with Postano, a social visualization and measurement platform, to display data on a huge digital video wall in the spin room.
Using Curator  a tool Twitter rolled out earlier this year to help media publishers search, filter and curate tweets for display on web, mobile or TV  CBS producers could select and display a scrolling timeline of tweets that ran alongside the candidates on CBSNews.com.

Thats where it started, with the data telling a story, said Sharp.
As the debate was happening, producers saw a spike around Clintons comment linking Wall Street campaign contributions to her work as a senator helping to rebuild downtown Manhattan after 9/11. Sharp said CBS used Curator as well as TweetDeck and Twitter itself to gather perspective on how Twitter users were reacting. Upon noticing that the majority of tweets were highly critical, the search was on for a tweet that would represent the consensus that was forming.
It was immediately apparent that this was the moment that was driving conversation, this was the moment people were going to be referring to at the water cooler the next day, said Sharp. Finding a tweet that referenced that wouldnt be just picking a face in the crowd, it was actually picking a voice of the crowd.
Then a comment by University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal surfaced:

Have never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations. Until now. @HillaryClinton #DemDebate
 Andy Grewal (@AndyGrewal) November 15, 2015

I couldnt believe the tone-deafness, Grewal later told the Des Moines Register. I felt compelled to make an actual critical remark.
Grewal had fewer than 200 followers when producers found the tweet, so it wasnt the most re-tweeted comment when it drew CBSs attention (its now been retweeted more than 2,800 times and liked by more than 3,000 Twitter users). Being an Iowa voter helped.
The fact that it came from an independent voter, added Sharp, in Iowa City, in his pajamas, who had never live-tweeted an event before, really just highlights, I think, the potential moving forward.
Before submitting the comment for air, CBS producers had to quickly vet Grewal, verifying his bio and reviewing past tweets for any sign he might be working for another campaign.
Thats where it gets important to have both that algorithmic layer and that human editorial judgment paired together, but neither can exist without the other, said Sharp. The reality is, with many millions of tweets about one of these primary debates, a human without help from the algorithm would drown under the volume. The key is, how do you get them at least to the right part of the haystack so they could start poking around a little bit more.
The candidates had already moved on from Wall Street contributions and were discussing gun control when the debate moderator, John Dickerson, interrupted them:
JOHN DICKERSON: Sorry, Im gonna bring in [CBS News Congressional Correspondent] Nancy Cordes with a question from Twitter about this exchange.
(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)
NANCY CORDES: about guns but also about your conversation on campaign finance. And Secretary Clinton, one of the tweets we sawsaid that Ive never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until nowthe idea being that, yes, you are a champion of the community after 9/11. But what does that have to do with taking big donations?
HILLARY CLINTON: Well, Im sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild. And so yes, I did know people. I had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds, say, I dont agree with you on everything. But I like what you do. I like how you stand up. Im going to support you. And I think that is absolutely appropriate.
The tweet was shown on a screen above the candidates as it was read, making it visible to all debate viewers. Reaction online was swift, with praise coming from other media outlets.
Micah Grimes, social media strategist for NBC Nightly News, tweeted:
Stellar use there by @CBSNews of a showing a real-time tweet from a general audience person to press a follow-up question.  Micah Grimes (@MicahGrimes) November 15, 2015
CNNs Brian Stelter, retweeting Grimes, wrote:

This is what @Twitter has wanted from news for years. Not just were reading your tweets but were reacting https://t.co/OWIoBZLiII
 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 15, 2015
Grewals tweet led to a short exchange involving Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley about Wall Streets economic and political power. Yet the comment also had a longer-lasting effect, giving the controversy over Clintons Wall Street ties more volume and validity in the post-debate narrative.
It was the level of impact Twitter officials had hoped to achieve going into the debate. Sharp said they wanted to show other news outlets that a Twitter-enabled debate could be meaningful and relevant.
For every prior debate since August, [CBS] producers have been using these tools to surface tweets around those debates. They have a very good handle of what type of content and what quality theyd be able to raise during their own broadcast, said Sharp.
And now, undoubtedly, producers of future debates know, Oh, I can get a great question from Twitter, and I can get it in real-time. I dont have to either take something stale thats weeks old, or something thats more stunty or kitschy, because that codes now been broken, if you will.
(In other words, there would be no doubt about the appropriateness of the question, the way there was, say, in 1994, when President Clinton was asked boxers or briefs during a MTV town hall. Answer: Usually briefs. I cant believe she did that.)
Dismantling the Debate Divide
Yet we still have a ways to go in U.S. political debates before technological innovation revolutionizes public engagement. Jennifer Stromer-Galley, a professor at Syracuse University and author of Presidential Campaigning in the Internet Age, cited numerous factors that deter innovationincluding risk-averse candidates used to controlling everything from podium height to lighting, and news outlets that see themselves as solely responsible for pressing candidates on tough issues and deciding which questions get asked.
Of course they are paying attention to what the public is saying and feeding that back to the candidates when it resonates, said Stromer-Galley. But if it doesnt match the politicians agenda or the journalists agenda, youre not going to get new kinds of questions, new kinds of voices, new sorts of topics.
Theres still something to be said for incremental change, she added. When you think about it, we had a debate in 1960 and we didnt have a televised debate again until the 70s. Weve had debates routinely after that, and the formatagain, very slowlyhas evolved to include more voices. And now with digital media, the information infrastructure that we live in opens up additional opportunities for the public to be more directly involved.
The next Republican debate is scheduled for Dec. 15 in Las Vegas and will be sponsored by CNN and Facebook. The Democrats follow on Dec. 19 in New Hampshire, in a debate sponsored by ABC News, WMUR-TV, and the New Hampshire Union Leader.
Sharp said Twitter expects to be involved in more debates but wouldnt provide specifics. Viewers, however, should expect future collaborations with news networks to be equally substantive and gimmick-free.
We dont want to give another excuse to dismiss the voter and centralize access to the candidates, Sharp said. By demonstrating that you can have this popular involvement and engagement in a meaningful, relevant way, it actually opens that door for, I think, a broader civic dialogue to be able to take place.

Trump watch: A very big swath of civil society in America is signing onto the We Are Better Than This statement, which decries the rising tide of hatred, violence and suspicion in America and pledges to stand with any community that is targeted by hateful rhetoric and violence. The statement was initiated by MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, United We Dream, the Center for Community Change, Demos, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Arab-American Association of New York SEIU and Color of Change. Andrew Rasiej and I are signers on behalf of Civic Hall. Please add your name.
White supremacists like David Duke and Stormfront founder Don Black say Donald Trumps campaign has revitalized their movement, Politicos Ben Schreckinger reports. Black says he is upgrading Stormfronts servers to deal with the steady increase in traffic he has seen since Trump began campaigning. Hes made it ok to talk about these incredible concerns of European Americans today, because I think European Americans know they are the only group that cant defend their own essential interests and their point of view, Duke says.
An online petition aimed at the British Parliament calling for Trump to be refused entry based on laws against hate speech has received more than 400,000 signatures, well beyond the 100,000 needed for it to prompt a parliamentary debate, Dan Bilefsky reports for the New York Times.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posts that I want to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world, adding that As a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities....If youre a Muslim in this community, as the leader of Facebook I want you to know that you are always welcome here and that we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you.
Facebooks head of global product policy Monika Bickert has responded to a Change.org petition calling on its to do more to delete accounts supporting ISIS or praising terrorism, saying there is no place on Facebook for terrorists, terrorist propaganda, or the praising of terror.

What sharing economy?: Remember that Freelancers Union study claiming that 54 million Americans are freelancers? Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, points out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a much lower estimate of 14.8 million self-employed workers. How to explain the difference? Mishel writes, the Freelancers Union estimate is of anyone engaged in supplemental, temporary, project- or contract-based work, within the past 12 months and even includes people who freelance but do not have any 1099 incomestretching this group beyond recognition. In contrast, the BLS estimate reflects those whose primary job is or primary income comes from self-employment. Why does this matter? Because, as Mishel carefully lays out, the Freelancers study has been used to claim that the gig economy is exploding, with tens of millions supposedly supporting themselves that way. And that doesnt appear to be the case.
Likewise, a new study from Intuit and Emergent Research finds something similar: the typical on-demand worker is a part-timer, working 12 hours a week via his or her primary platform and collecting 22 percent of their household income from work obtained through online marketplaces or applications that connect providers to customers.

Trump watch: Donald Trumps call to stop allowing Muslims from entering the United States was denounced by most of the Republican field along with the chairmen of the Republican state parties in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Yahoo Politics Jon Ward reports.
The one major Republican presidential candidate who has so far refused to denounce Trumps proposal is Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whose rise in the polls in Iowa may have triggered Trumps latest blast, as Margaret Hartmann reports for New York magazine.
Speaking in South Carolina, Cruz only said this about Trumps call: That is not my policy. Ive introduced legislation in the Senate that would put in place a three-year moratorium on refugees coming from countries where ISIS or al Qaeda can control a substantial amount of territory. How reasonable.
It is also worth noting that until Cruzs remarks on Saturday, promising to carpet-bomb ISIS into oblivion and asserting that I dont know if sand can glow in the dark, but were going to find out, the last major American presidential candidate to suggest using nuclear weapons on one of our adversaries was Barry Goldwater, who ran in 1964. The Republican Senator from Arizona suggested using low-yield A-bombs in North Vietnam, to defoliate forests and destroy infrastructure.
In the wake of Trumps latest shart on the political process, the Huffington Posts proprietor Arianna Huffington writes that the news site will stop treating him as an entertainment topic (if you recall, the sites editors had made a big deal back in July of putting coverage of his campaign in their entertainment section). Huffington didnt mince words:
Now that Trump, aided by the media, has doubled down on the cruelty and know-nothingness that defined his campaigns early days, the can you believe he said that? novelty has curdled and congealed into something repellent and threatening  laying bare a disturbing aspect of American politics. We believe that the way we cover the campaign should reflect this shift. And part of that involves never failing to remind our audience who Trump is and what his campaign really represents.

Our borderless world: Speaking at a private fundraiser for Hillary Clintons campaign, former President Bill Clinton made a smart point about Trumps desire to insulate America from the outside world by building walls and banning immigrants: Even if Donald Trump builds his wall at the Rio Grande, the Internet will pierce it, he said, as Gabriel Debenedetti reports for Politico.

Opining in the New York Times online, Googles Eric Schmidt offers some interesting ideas for how to insure that the global Internet remains a force for open society: We should make it ever easier to see the news from another countrys point of view, and understand the global consciousness free from filter or bias. We should build tools to help de-escalate tensions on social media  sort of like spell-checkers, but for hate and harassment. We should target social accounts for terrorist groups like the Islamic State, and remove videos before they spread, or help those countering terrorist messages to find their voice. Without this type of leadership from government, from citizens, from tech companies, the Internet could become a vehicle for further disaggregation of poorly built societies, and the empowerment of the wrong people, and the wrong voices. Not clear from his oped is who we are and how we decide who the wrong people are.

Back to the Internet election: Ever since an obscure Southern governor named Jimmy Carter surged to national attention by winning the Iowa caucuses in 1976, the political class has treated the state as an outsized kingmaker in our crazy-long presidential selection process. But as Emma Roller writes in a smart oped for todays New York Times, with the campaigns spending little of their money (just 3%) in Iowa, and candidates like Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum dropping out or teetering at the edge despite making strong pushes in Iowa, it now appears voters are more likely to engage with a candidate on Facebook or Twitter than on a rope line. This, she says, feeds a campaign process that rewards going viral and winning the media primary by being as outrageous as possible.
Following an online poll of its members, along with the votes of its nine state affiliates and four national organizational partners, the Working Families Party has endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for president.

"Citizens of Sarpallo VDC in Mahottari district waiting for the VDC office to open." (LIG report)

The money was supposed to buy bicycles for ten girls attending public school in Mahottari, Nepal. The head of the village government allocated 150,000 rupeesabout $1,400for the project, which he said would encourage girls from the marginalized Dalit (so-called untouchable) community to attend school. An auditor signed the paperwork and the money left the governments coffers.
Not a single student in the village got a bicycle, says Pranav Budhathoki, the founder and CEO of the Local Interventions Group. Budhathoki received an anonymous report of the missing funds during the pilot of an anti-corruption project he is looking to launch throughout the country of Nepal. He immediately sent his regional representative, a respected journalist in Mahottari, to find out what happened to the money.
Budhathoki is trying to curb corruption in Nepal by publishing information about local government budgetsabout where money should have goneand then eliciting feedback from citizens about what projects actually happened. In urban, wealthy contexts, people can use smartphones and apps to crowdsource information about corruption, but Budhathoki knew that wouldnt work in rural, undeveloped parts of Nepal. So he came up with an alternative: People could submit reports of corruption using very simple toolstext messages and phone callsand he would use technology on the back end to aggregate, analyze, and publish the data. This is the key to development, he says: not to increase funding or develop new projects, but rather to give citizens the information and the tools they need to demand accountability.
The problem is not resources, he explains. The problem is citizens not knowing how much the government has allocated in their name. To solve the problem of corruption, he says, its necessary for people to be engaged and involved and reporting what they see around them, the malpractices and corruption issues.
According to Budhathoki, the Nepali government sends money to Village Development Committees to address every imaginable social injustice, but up to 60 percent of that allocated budget gets sent back to national coffers because the local governments dont spend it, he says. Local news reports corroborate that claim. As a result, Budhathoki says, health centers are running without medicines and doctors, and kids are attending schools with no books or teachers.
Budhathoki founded the Local Interventions Group in September 2011. Since then, hes launched an app aimed at reducing police abuses and increasing police effectiveness and has used the open-source software Ushahidi to address cheating and violence in the 2013 Nepali elections and to ensure that earthquake relief services and supplies reached the right people after this years earthquake. His newest project tackles corruption head-on by publishing information about budgets and then crowdsourcing reports of corruption. He ran a pilot project last year in two of Nepals 75 districts, and, over the next two years, he plans to scale up the program so it will reach the entire country.
Heres how it works: First, the Local Interventions Groups regional representatives, all well-connected reporters, ask government officials how much money was earmarked for, say, schools or clinics in a certain area. Then, the Local Interventions Group crowdsources reports about what is needed, what is being done, and the quality of the work.
During a three-month pilot, Budhathoki solicited reports in each of three categories: absenteeism of local officials, misspent or disappeared development funds, and missing pension payments. At Mobile Help Desks, volunteers gathered information from text messages and phone calls. Budhathoki received 1,300 citizen reports. Then, the regional representatives verify the reports with local government officials and threaten to make the information public unless the grievance is resolved. Over the course of the three months, the Local Interventions Group verified about 600 to 700 genuine, specific, and actionable reports.
Take the bikes for female students, for example. Budhathokis contact in Mahottari took the report of the stolen bicycle funds to the district government. Within three days, he got a call from the chief district official, Budhathoki says. The Village Development Committee secretary admitted responsibility and promised to return the money. It took three more months, but the 150,000 rupees was finally returned back to the national coffers, Budhathoki says. No girls have gotten bicycles, since theres a new government with new priorities in office, but the money is back where it belongs.
As Budhathoki scales up his anti-corruption project to the entire country of Nepal, he hopes to streamline his interactions with the government. His NGO will collect, vet, and verify grievances; map them onto a GIS platform; and then share the reports both with government officials and civil society organizations. That way, each district official, head of the village government, [will] see these reports at his desk, on his computer, early morning every day so that he can talk to his colleagues on the ground and do something about that, Budhathoki says.
Several researchers who have investigated anti-corruption programs say such collaboration is the key to success. Carla Miller is the founder and president of City Ethics, a nonprofit that aims to help local governments develop programs to prevent corruption, and has prosecuted federal corruption cases involving elected officials. Shes found that anti-corruption programs entirely internal to the government with no line to citizens can themselves be corrupted, while citizen groups can lose momentum and dont necessarily understand the inner workings of government. Ultimately, you have to have communication, collaboration, she says.
The spirit of collaboration with government officials was behind Budhathokis decision to take down a map of crowdsourced corruption reports hed initially published on the Local Interventions Groups website. We put it up for a month and then we shut it down because the government was getting antsy because they didnt want citizens to know theres a lot of corruption in the government agencies, Budhathoki says. Of course everyone knows that theres a lot of corruption in government agencies at the local level but they didnt want that to be up on the website for everyone to see.
So, in the end, Budhathoki came to the conclusion that taking the map down was the right decision. Were okay with that because my approach has been collaborating with government officials rather than confronting them, he saysand, now, he adds, he can walk into government offices and say, Alright, lets try to change something on the ground.
This is a controversial approach. Some analysts, such as Miller, agree that taking down the map was the right call. Maps of corruption and press and then a reaction from the government is just a short-term solution, she says, that doesnt integrate citizens into long-term planning and identifying those issues faster.
Yuen Yuen Ang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has looked at the platform I Paid A Bribe, which crowdsources reports of corruption in India, and similar platforms in order to identify what works and what doesnt. She agrees that working with the government should be Budhathokis priority.
Budhathoki made a pragmatic choice in agreeing to the governments requestwhich, importantly, was a request, not a demand, she wrote in an email. By doing so, he avoids antagonizing the government, making it more likely for state authorities to work with his organization to take concrete steps in fighting petty corruption.
The purpose [of crowd-sourcing initiatives] is not to shame the government or individual officials, because, as Budhathoki himself points out, everybody already knows there is a lot of corruption, she adds.
The Local Interventions Group isnt combating corruption within elite circles, which Ang says would call for a political response, but rather what Ang refers to as petty corruptionthat is, low-stakes, diffused corruption that directly affects the lives of regular citizens. Changing out government officials has no effect on small-scale corruption, Ang says, since its a systemic problem. Instead, the best way to approach the problem is through procedural changes: for example, reducing bureaucratic discretion, centralizing budgetary management, reforming public compensation practices, etc.
Budhathoki was able to make such a collaborative procedural change when it came to paying pensions. During his pilot, he found many people didnt get their pensions on time, or at all. The government officials decided that, when the next month of pension payments came due, theyd have the Local Interventions Groups regional representatives oversee the process, verifying who was owed a pension and who received one. That way, we know how much money is being given to whom, Budhathoki says. The whole process [is] transparent.
Thats the kind of change he hopes to continue to make in the future. That happened because were seen as partners, he concludes.

First Post 




Before Black Twitter, there was Afro-Netizen, an email listserv-turned-blog started in 1999 that rose to prominence when political blogs achieved more mainstream acceptance and popularity in the run-up to the 2004 election. Last month, Afro-Netizen founder Chris Rabb announced that he is running to be the Democratic candidate for State Representative in Pennsylvania.
As a new media expert and experienced citizen of the internet, it comes as no surprise that in a recent article about a new crowdfunding platform for politics, Chris Rabb was mentioned as one of the first to announce a candidacy largely because of support shown on the platform.
Earlier this week, Civicist reached out to Rabb, now an adjunct professor at Temple University, to ask if Crowdpac, the company behind the new crowdfunding platform, had as much influence on his decision to run as the USA Today piece suggested. We also discussed the limits of digital tools, how he would address structural inequality, and what he would like to see done to close the digital divide.
The thing that Crowdpac did the most for me was to have a platform to accept money without having to officially declare, he told Civicist. Crowdpac is meant to ease the path to candidacy for political outsiders by making it easy to gauge support, by either nonmonetary endorsements or financial pledges, before officially declaring, at which point pledges go to the candidate as campaign donations.
Without Crowdpac, Rabb said, I couldnt ask for money, or people would have to give me money personally which means they would have to trust that I would actually use that money to launch a campaign, and if I didnt to give it back.
Rabb also appreciates that the Crowdpac platform promotes people as viable candidates based on breadth of support, not depth. That means that a popular candidate supported primarily by small donors will show up as doing better than one with a single backer who gave $50,000.
It promote[s] participatory democracy, he told Civicist. In any other circumstance I would be looked at as an underdog.
Chris Rabb remains clear-eyed about the limits of platforms like Crowdpac. It wouldnt have worked if I didnt have a heck of a lot of digital capital, he said.
He pointed out that he has around 4,200 Facebook friends to call on for supportfar more than his competitors are likely to have, he saidand that those friends are mostly diverse, well-connected, politically-engaged, and have disposable income. Rabb said that he is incredibly active on Facebook, and because his activity is often related to politicsas opposed to someone often posting pictures of their children or animalsit lends itself to his developing political platform.
But even without that, he was emphatic that his success online is a direct result of his own privilege: from a comfortable upbringing to the connection at the Democratic National Committee that helped him get a media pass to the Democratic convention back in the day.
People with privilege are going to do much better on Crowdpac than people who dont have those access points, Rabb said. The networks that I have would be valuable whether I use Crowdpac or not, or whether I use Facebook or not. Those things just amplify the privilege I already had.
As for how he would address structural inequalities if he were elected, Rabb said that he wants to see Pennsylvania use tax policies to encourage companies that create community wealth and shared prosperity that lifts all boats. This would include civically-oriented businesses, those that foster participatory democracy, build communities, and diversify media, for example.
Rabb pointed to the controversial tax breaks given to the telecommunications giant Comcast (saving them more than $29 million from 2008  2013 alone) as an example of fostering corporate wealth rather than shared community wealth. Hes not alone; those breaks have been the subject of protests in Philadelphia and some have blamed a flailing public school system on the loss of tax revenue.
Speaking of telecommunications giants, when asked what he would like to see done about the digital divide, Rabb said, the government should negotiate very carefully with internet service providers to make it ubiquitous and affordable. He added that he thinks it should be a public utility.

Election 2016 




This is civic tech: Its been a roller-coaster of a week in America, bookended by mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado and a social service center in California. Our brains and the media nervous system that feeds (on) them are more on edge than usual, it seems. The news from last Friday, that gun sales on Black Friday broke national one-day sales records, reverberated darkly. But reflecting back on the data, and how the media covered that news, I couldnt help but notice something else: Giving Tuesday, which was founded just three years ago as a response to the mass consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, has taken off like wildfire. Its far more than a hashtag campaign. Arguably, its become the most successful civic tech culture hack of the decade. But the media, so far, isnt telling that story. To wit:

Number of gun sale background checks on Black Friday, 2015: 185,345
Number of gun sale background checks on Black Friday, 2014: 175,754
Percentage increase, year to year: 5%
Number of stories in the U.S. mainstream media touting the 2015 gun sales as an all-time record: 43
Number of donations made to non-profit organizations on Giving Tuesday, 2015: 1.08 million
Number of donations made to non-profit organizations on Giving Tuesday, 2014: 296,000
Total raised in 2015: $116.7 million
Total raised in 2014: $45.7 million
Percentage increase, year to year: 255%
Number of mainstream media stories headlining the record-breaking 2015 Giving Tuesday results: 0
Percentage of Americans who said, according to a recent poll by the Templeton Giving Survey, that they were familiar with Giving Tuesday: 18%
Percentage who said they were familiar with Black Friday: 93%


Its great to see such positive results from online donations: This is truly a cause for celebration, Henry Timms, one of the co-founders of Giving Tuesday and the executive director of 92Y, told the Chronicle of Philanthropy. In addition, beyond these numbers, there are offline donations not measured hereas well as the impact of volunteer efforts; campaigns that encourage acts of kindness or donations of goods (like food and coats); classroom programs that are growing the next generation of philanthropists; and regional campaigns in towns, cities, and states that generate civic pride and bring communities together around giving. All of those outcomes are equally important measures of success.
In other civic tech news: Code for Sacramentos civic hackers have launched OpenBudgetSac.org, where a series of visualization tools helps users more easily understand the citys budget.

Queens College sociology professor Andrew Beveridge, the president and co-founder of SocialExplorer.com, produced these visualizations to show how radically this would shift representation, district by district, across the country.

Code for Americas Catherine Bracy says, in a symposium in the New York Times online, progressive activists should relax and see what Zuckerberg and Chan do with their philanthropy. Government shouldnt be the sole funder of work in the public interest, she argues. Amen to that.
The best part about this new post from Zuckerberg, where he further explains the reasoning behind making the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative an LLC (it can fund nonprofits, invest in for-profits, and engage in policy debates), is reading his responses to random comments in the thread.

In 2005, as a political science student at the University of Maryland, I was asked us to go off-campus and into two nearby communities. One was home to golf courses, the other to recent immigrant populations. The assignment was to collect data and observations on the local grocery shopping experience. We were asked to record the price of staples like milk and orange juice, and also to pay attention to the general experience of shopping, from the state of the parking lot to the presence of security staff to the hue of the lighting. This assignment did more to underscore the inequality between Langley Park and Bethesda, Marylandonly a few stops apart on the D.C. Beltwaythan any number of damning statistics presented in the same class.


A core theme thats emerged across our Microsoft Technology & Civic Engagement teams work is making it easier for more and more people to enter the field of civic technology. As many others have noted, the field needs a talent pipeline to succeed at scale. Its why we built the Civic Graph and launched the Tech Jobs Academy with the City University of New York. Its clear from the number of open positions and the amount of work to be done to modernize democracy that we need to attract more talent, and more diverse talent, to this sector.


Through conversations with students attending colleges across New York City, we realized that many classes cover subject matter that could, in their projects and assignments, introduce an entire generation of students to civic tech.


There are a growing number of college- and graduate-level courses focused specifically on civic and social innovation. Theyre taught by civically-minded academics like Susan Crawford, Dan Nguyen, and Sasha Costanza-Chock, and in programs like MITs DUSP. These courses are great for students with an existing interest in applying their skills to shared challenges, especially when they encourage students to get building.


But there are many more courses teaching even more students statistics, policy, computer science, and many other topics. Students efforts throughout a semester represent a huge and unrealized amount of latent value, in the work they produce in the short-term as well as the career paths they take in the long-term. The faculty instructing these mainstream courses could compound their educational impact over decades by embedding examples where the existing subject-matter gets applied in civic tech. This wouldnt require changes to the curriculum, simply a link between the topics theyre teaching and the professionals applying those same topics to improve society in the real world.


For example, students learning statistics work with a fair amount of sample data. Rather than work with hypothetical or random data, the students could be instructed to download raw data from their citys open data portal. They would end up learning not just the statistics lesson itself, but also that open government data exists, and how to download and do something with it. Students learning Javascript could build a sample application that calculates the speed of a bus sitting in traffic.
Civic Tech Case Finder


To make it easier for faculty to introduce their students to applied case studies from civic tech, were designing a civic tech case finder. Its a lightweight aggregatormost of the cases themselves will continue living where they were originally published by their authors. Our task is to make it easier for instructors to easily identify relevant cases to bring into their curriculum in a short amount of time.


 Instructors can select the subject and approximate grade level they teach, or just browse all cases. 

Were prototyping the application now and collecting feedback from civic-minded academic faculty across a wide range of fields. Weve started with the civically-focused faculty weve come across in our work, but would love to spread the word and get this in front of professors without current connections to the field.


Long-term, we need to collect more cases and find an appropriate home for the project. Get in touch if youd like to try it out and provide feedback in a user interview, or better yet, share it with the professors in your life.


Props to John Paul Farmer, who came up with the civic tech case finder, and Saron Yitbarek, who has led the technical development of the case finder as well as the user interviews.

Civic TechEducation 




Giving it away: This years Giving Tuesday broke records, with more than 1 million recorded gifts and at least $116 million raised from about 700,000 donors, its co-founder Henry Timms of the 92nd St Y reports. Thats more than double what was raised last year.
While InsidePhilanthropys David Callahan offers some tempered praise for Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chans pledge to donate most of their megazillions to charity, and in particular to promoting equality, he still thinks its darn scary. Heres why:
Todays economic inequality may be nothing compared to tomorrows civic inequality as more activist mega-donors emerge with big money and big ambitionsat a time, I should add, when government will be spiraling down into fiscal paralysis due to soaring entitlement costs as the boomers retire. If the 20th century was the era of Big Government, the 21st Century is shaping up as the age of Big Philanthropy. This power shift is one of the most important stories of our time....Close your eyes for a moment and imagine that yesterday it was the Koch brothers who had pledged to use their entire fortune (of $85 billion) to shape the direction of U.S. society. The picture would look a bit different, right? Philanthropy is not a meritocracy, nor is there a moral litmus test for entering. Anyone with enough money can play. And as more billionaires enter this gamewhether we cheer them or fear themits getting harder for the rest of us to be heard in the public square.

The New Yorkers John Cassidy points out that by (eventually) giving their Facebook stock to an LLC, Zuckerberg and Chans giving comes at a cost to the taxpayer and, arguably, to the broader democratic process. If Zuckerberg and Chan were to cash in their Facebook stock, rather than setting it aside for charity, they would have to pay capital-gains tax on the proceeds, money that could be used to fund government programs. If they willed their wealth to their descendants, then sizable estate taxes would become due on their deaths. By making charitable donations in the form of stock, they, and their heirs, will escape both of these levies.

Baby talk: In tandem with the birth of their daughter Max, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, are creating a new organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In an open letter to Max, they have pledged to donate 99 percent of their Facebook stock, currently worth more than $45 billion, to charitable purposes including personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities, as Vindu Goel and Nick Wingfield report for the New York Times.


Heres the text of the Zuckerberg-Chan letter describing their pledge to Max. Dont miss the congratulatory comments from the likes of Shakira, Maria Shriver, Arianna Huffington, Gavin Newsom and Katie Couric.


Seriously, the Zuckerberg-Chan letter is quite an evocative statement of what, in a different context, the writer Anand Giriharadas has called the Aspen Consensus (i.e. the winners of our age must be challenged to do more good, but never, ever tell them to do less harm.) We can advance human potential and promote equality and lift hundreds of millions out of poverty through scientific advances against disease, personalized learning, and more internet access, Zuckerberg and Chan write their daughter. Theres no mention anywhere of systemic forces that destroy human potential, ravage communities, or increase inequality. Nor do they contemplate the possibility that much stronger medicine (taxes? regulations?) might be needed to promote equality than just improving education.


Responding to Zuckerberg and Chans announcement, Nathan Schneider, co-organizer of the recent Platform Cooperatives conference, tweeted: What if, instead of picking pet charities, Zuckerberg returned his shares to the users who made Facebook feel like a commons?...The wealth Zuckerberg wants to give away is the wealth of our relationships, our wisdom, our milestones, our communities.

What sharing economy? Hubert Horan, one of the architects of trucking deregulation in the 1970s, has written (in the form of a letter to Pando Daily) a long and absolutely fascinating critique of Uber and other unicorn companies with a similar business model, like Convoy, which is trying to be the Uber of trucking. The tl/dr version: Unlike Amazon and Ebay, Uber and Convoy are not transforming the consumer product they provide, nor is there much evidence of bloat and waste in the industries theyve entered. Instead, their raw political power and ruthless marketplace behavior is all they actually have. Heres the key paragraph:
Extreme wealth accumulation and corporate power has been historically tolerated because of the perception that the Bezos and Omidyars of the world (like the Carnegies and Rockefellers of the past) created huge public welfare improvements en route to their wealth and power and the (more problematic) perception that the size and power of this class will be constrained by economic reality at the end of the day. Uber-type unicorns are purely exploitativethey create fabulous wealth for a handful, while destroying economic value in aggregate (assets have been shifted from more efficient firms to a less efficient firm, artificial market power is used to exploit drivers, suppliers and consumers, etc.). Wealth accumulators whod built companies on legitimate economic strengths needed political power defensivelyto protect their pot of gold, and to slow down the market forces that would inevitably erode those strengths. Uber-type investors need much more political power, and they need to use it as an offensive weapon immediately on start-up. If the unicorn investing class thinks Uber has proven that tens of billions of private value can be created purely with PR and political strength, then Unicorn manufacturing becomes an industry unto itself. Lots of investors will attempt to replicate the formula time and time again, and each new unicorn creates the need to increase raw political power used to enrich these investors, and to destroy any possible political opposition.


Trump watch: Channeling Marshall McLuhan, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff argues that Donald Trump is the ultimate internet candidate, not in how he is using the network to organize his supporters, but in how digigenic his performance is. He writes:
Theres no great network of Trump Meetups or series of Reddit exchanges. Yet Trump is an internet spectacle nonethelessa political Charlie Sheen who seems to know exactly how to ride the crest of trending topics, or even create them. On television, his speeches are incoherent mashups, without a clear story or theme. As clickbait, though, they are perfect: short, angry slogans, each more explosive than the last. With Sheen it was tiger blood and winning; with Trump, its Jersey City Jihadists and also, possibly, winning.


FWD.us, the pro-immigration group backed by Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and other tech moguls, is planning to spend as much as $10 million over the next year to tilt the political system toward reform in 2017, Blake Hounshell reports for Politico.

Opening government: Advocates for greater transparency and accountability in government are celebrating yesterdays corruption conviction of New York states former assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, and there is a delicious irony buried in this story by Vivian Yee and Nate Schweber for the New York Times on the jury deliberations. Silvers defense attorneys had argued that nothing he didincluding steering $500K in state money to a longtime crony, who then referred some of his patients with potentially profitable legal claims to law firms that paid Silver millions in legal feeswas illegal, and that in fact this was just business as usual in Albany. (Yes, that was their defense.) The last juror to hold out on a guilty verdict wasnt convinced this pattern of transactions was scheming or manipulation until she noticed that the name of one of the law firms was hidden in Silvers legislative financial disclosure forms. I was wondering, why wouldnt it just be out in the open just like the other things, why was this kind of hidden, she recalled later. Within the hour, the jury had reached its unanimous verdict. Those of us with long memories recall that it was Silvers failure to be fully transparent on his annual disclosure forms that got federal investigators interested in him in the first place. The next time you hear someone say that increased transparency doesnt help with fighting corruption, ask them if they know how Silver was caught.

First Post 



A few days ago, Tom Steinbergthe founder and former director of mySocietywrote a fascinating piece on power that was meant for people developing civic technology.
In a post on Medium, Tom clearly describes the nature of power as it relates to technology and implored civic technologists to think more directly about how shifts in power are affected by the development and adoption of new technologies. He uses the analogy of a nuclear bomb and the contraceptive pill to describe the different kinds of power shifts that can occur when technology becomes more broadly adopted.
Technologies that are like the Bomb can dramatically shift power between different parties, but this shift is a temporary oneonce the technology becomes more broadly adopted the advantage of having it dissipates. The effect of the power shift is temporary.
On the other hand, innovations like the Pill can shift power in a way that does not dissipate when it becomes more broadly adopted.
Women making use of the Pill became relatively more powerful than they were previously. But once the pill was universally available they did not lose relative power again.

The effect of the power shift created by these kinds of innovations is more permanent.
This is an interesting way to think about technology in general and civic technology specificallynew innovations alter existing power structures, and those of us in the world of civic technology should think carefully about how what we do shifts power. If we care about the long term impact of what we do, then we should focus our efforts on the kinds of things that will create more permanent shifts in power, and more directly benefit those that do not currently have it.
Open Data as the Pill?
When I think about innovations that are more Pill-likespecifically in the realm of civic technologymy mind is immediately (and probably not surprisingly) drawn to open data. Open data can shift power from the bureaucracy to the individual, providing access that previously might have required resources to obtainfor example, via a FOIA requestor through a political connection or special relationship. And the benefit of open data to any one user doesnt dissipate if it is used by others or if more open data is published.
I believe the power shift created by open data has legs.
But this power shift goes beyond just greater permanencethe framework of Bomb versus Pill can miss a key benefit that is provided by open data, and other innovations like it. I think we can improve this framework for describing the power shifts caused by new innovations by adding another categorythe Shot.
The Power of the Shot

Perhaps no other innovation in the last 100 years has provided more benefits to the disadvantagedthose without powerthan vaccines. The burden of infectious disease falls disproportionately on the poor and those without resources. The development of vaccines that cure and prevent infectious diseases can extended life expectancy, empowered women in poor countries, andamong other thingshelp promote peace, mobility, and stability.
All of these outcomes provide outsized benefits to those without power and resources (because those with power and resources are more likely to already enjoy those benefits). There are clear power-shifting impacts inherent in the work to eradicate infectious diseases.
Like the Pill, the power shift caused by vaccines does not dissipate as it is more broadly adopted. The effectiveness of a vaccine that protects against a specific disease doesnt diminish if it is used in one country or 100. But the magical thing about innovations like vaccines is not that their power doesnt dissipate as they become ubiquitous, its that their power and benefit can be enhanced as the become more widely adopted.
As vaccines become more broadly adopted, the population can benefit from so called herd immunity. According to the World Health Organization, herd immunity occurs when:
The decline of disease incidence is greater than the proportion of individuals immunized because vaccination reduces the spread of an infectious agent by reducing the amount and/or duration of pathogen shedding by vaccinees, retarding transmission.

This reduces overall disease incidence and benefits even those that do not (or can not) take vaccines directly.
On an individual level, the Shot can cause a power shift that has permanence in much the same way as the Pill. But as the adoption of this innovation becomes more broad, the depth and breadth of this benefit is enhancedbroader adoption creates a more fundamental power shift.
Open Data as the Shot
Open data can create a power shift by giving individuals with limited resources or without political connections or special relationships access to information about their government and elected officials. Like the Pill, this power shift doesnt dissipate as open data becomes more broadly adopted. Andmore importantlylike the Shot, the power shift caused by open data can be broadened and deepened as more and more governments begin to adopt open data.
On an individual level, I benefit from open data by having new insights into the operation of my government. As more governments begin to adopt open data, I can gain additional insights by understanding how well my government operates in relation to other governments across the country, and around the world.
If my government releases information on infant mortality or educational attainment, it may provide new insights into the state of my community. If other governments release similar kinds of data, it can provide additional insights as to how my community compares to jurisdictions in other places. Like the Shot, broader adoption of open data can lead to a more fundamental power shift.
This is not meant to suggest that every open data set creates the kind of power shift we should be looking for, or that open data can not be used to protect those that already have power. There is much more work to be done to realize the true promise of open data.
Its also true that not every vaccine has the proper focus or potency to achieve a shift in power. But this doesnt take away from power disrupting potential of this innovation.
The adoption of open data can result in a shift in power from those who have it to those that do not. As open data gets more broadly adopted, its potential to shift power in lasting and fundamental ways is increased.
For those of us that work in the world of civic technology, its important to understand how new innovations can shift power. Will our work produce innovations like the Bomb, the Pill, or the Shot?
Its up to us to decide.

Civic TechOpen Data 





Todays civic tech must-read: Former mySociety director Tom Steinberg calls on technologists to focus on building tools that permanently shift power. He argues that the power-shifting effects of fundraising apps and targeted political ads have been temporary (the other side catches up), whereas mobile computing is a power shifting technology that permanently empowers the security services.


Parija Kavalanz reports for CNN Money on how Hive, a NY-based start-up funded by the United Nations Refugee Agency, is using predictive data modeling to find the Americans most likely to support refugees.

Brave new world: The Los Angeles city council wants to to access a database of license plates captured in certain places around the city, translate these license plates to obtain the name and address of each owner, and send to that owner a letter explaining that the vehicle was seen in, an area known for prostitution.

The letter comes with a personal knock on the door, offers of social services and a warning of the enhanced penalties a subject may received if arrested again for a violent crime. Crawford writes that this data-driven initiative seeks to use cops as guardians rather than warriors, building public trust and legitimacy through pro-active interventions, but with the Chicago police union currently standing firm behind the cop who shot Laquan McDonald its hard to see why anyone should trust that these predictive models arent biased at their base.


The Indian radical writer Arundhati Roy describes what it was like for her, American actor John Cusack, and Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg to meet NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in Moscow. Two observations from her worth pondering: the first is how both Ellsberg and Snowden were, originally, totally devoted to patriotic missions (for Ellsberg, to save his country from communism, and for Snowden, to save it from Islamic terrorism). And second, how the debate over Snowden and the NSA leaves out other countries, other cultures, other conversations.

Brave new world: Sasha Issenberg reports for Bloomberg Politics on the work of data-mining start-up Applecart, which has built a social graph of the voters of New Hampshire in an attempt to figure out not just who is connected to who socially, but who has the greatest influence on who. The companys data comes from library visits nationwide (to cull yearbooks, church lists, sports rosters and the like) to the scraping of websites that contain things like law-firm directories. Issenberg writes:
On Applecarts social graph of New Hampshire, each voter is treated as a node in a network with each of their known contacts webbed around them. (Around a dozen voters in the state were found to be hermits, with no meaningful interpersonal links.) Nuclear family, extended family, friends, professional acquaintances, and non-professional acquaintances are each assigned different statistical weights, then mixed with other values such as geographical proximity to calibrate a connection score between the voters in question.
The company is working on behalf of John Kasichs presidential Super PAC. Applecart has also built a social network analysis of large donors to moderate Republican presidential candidates in the past, giving Kasich fundraisers a list of targets to woo.

Todays civic-tech must-read: Joshua Tauberer, a 15-year veteran of open government platform-making (he runs GovTrack.us), has posted a well-reasoned rant explaining why people trying to fix democracy with new tech tools or platforms are almost universally going to fail. IMHO, Tauberer is a bit too harsh, but he is right to argue that most people approach this arena with little sense of how hard or expensive it is to make a dent in the problem


Related: Longtime press critic Michael Massing takes note of recent efforts by the New York Times to cover the one percent, like a front-page story focused on the 158 families that have given nearly half the money raised by presidential candidates, but argues that more such attention is needed. He writes:
In American journalism as a whole, the coverage of the superrich is far too sporadic, fleeting, and unimaginative to make a real difference. News organizations need to develop a new methodology that can allow them to document the structure of wealth, power, and influence in Americato show how the ultrarich make their money, what they do with it, and to what effect. The coverage needs to be more sustained, ambitious, and broadly conceived. And digital technology can help.


Massing points to some exemplars (without hyperlinks in the original, thoughwhats up with that, New York Review of Books editors?): Muckety, along with three other eye-on-the-elite groups, LittleSis, SourceWatch, and RightWeb, are all useful, but they are underfunded, overmatched, and (at times) ideologically oriented. A new site with an experienced staff of reporters, editors, and digital whizzes could burrow deep into the world of the one percent and document the remarkable impact they are having on so many areas of American life. As information on them is gathered, it could be incorporated into a database that could become the go-to site for information about the nations elite and their power. Of course, such a site would cost a bit of money to create. Where might such money be found?

Attendees of the Basic Income Create-a-thon.

A social-enterprise-marketer-slash-Lyft-driver recently started something called the My Basic Income project, a crowdfunding campaign to financially support one person (or more) for one year. Inspired by an existing project in Germany with the same premise, if the crowdfunding campaign is successful, the My Basic Income project will hold a raffle to determine who will receive $1,250 a month for twelve months. As part of the project, people signing up for the raffle would be asked to say what the income would allow them to do.
The project was started at the Basic Income Create-a-thon, which ran from November 13  15 in San Francisco. The Create-a-thon was put on by the Universal Income Project, a new nonprofit sponsored by the Roosevelt Institute. Interest in basic income has been rising worldwide, but the recent Create-a-thon and the resulting projects indicate that at least a small number of Americans are ready to stop talking and start taking things into their own hands.
This video was produced over the course of the Create-a-thon.
Cameron Ottens, the Lyft driver and small business owner who helped start My Basic Income, is fairly new to the idea of a basic income. He tells Civicist he first started reading about it six months ago. Once he was sold on the idea, however, he realized he realized we shouldnt hold our breath waiting for our government to get to it.
I thought the crowdfunding they were doing in Germany was a great ideato just start, instead of waiting for a gatekeeper or politician to do it, Ottens says. (The founders from the project in Germany actually attended the event.)
The ultimate goal is to spread the idea of this from a personal angle, Ottens says, which is why he is asking people to share what they would do if provided with a basic income. Ottens thinks that it will help dispel the belief that a guaranteed basic income would make everyone (else) lazy.
In the introduction to the crowdfunding campaign, Ottens writes:

Imagine if you could give someone $1,250 per month with no obligations, no limitations, and no strings attached for one full year. How would that change their life?
We want to find out! What would happen if everyone had an amount of money that covers their basic needs? Would people be lazy or would they use it to take on new risks? Would they waste it in one night or invest with intention in their futures? We dont know, but what if we funded a full year of basic income for a complete stranger, to find out?

I asked if there would be some kind of report at the end, to prove the success of projects like My Basic Income. He acknowledge the inherent contradiction in requiring someone to do something in exchange for no-strings-attached cashhis hope is that recipients (if not all than some) would be moved to help spread the word.
The Basic Income Create-a-thon was attended by more than 60 people actively working on various projects, and more than a hundred came Sunday to see the final presentations (with another 350 watching a livestream). Jim Pugh, one of the organizers of the Create-a-thon, tells Civicist that organizers in Los Angeles and Minneapolis, Minnesota, have already reached out about conducting Create-a-thons in their respective cities.
Jim Pugh, the CEO of Share Progress, says that he connected with other advocates for universal basic income earlier this year, and the Create-a-thon is the result of their conversations. They originally came up with the idea of hosting a hackathon but as a group decided they didnt feel comfortable having it be exclusively tech-focused. A Create-a-thon allows for input from artists, writers, filmmakers, and other non-techies.
I havent worked specifically in the arts space before but recognize the value of those people involved if you want to make an emotional appeal for a new idea, Pugh says. He tells Civicist that, as a Bay Area resident, he realizes that a more automated future is almost guaranteed, and the basic income is a feasible solution for when full employment isnt feasible or necessarily desirable.
As for Ottens, he says that with a basic income he would spend a little less time driving, and a little more time growing his business.

Governing attitudes: The Pew Research Center is out with a new report on Americans attitudes toward government. While many of the findings are familiaronly one in five trust the government always or most of the timesome are startling.


27 percent of registered voters say they think of the federal government as an enemy vs. 36 percent who see it as a friend, with 35 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of independents, and 12 percent of Democrats describing it as an enemy.


The top rated government agencies are the U.S. Postal Service, the National Park Service, and the Centers for Disease Control. (Veterans Affairs and the IRS are the lowest rated.)


A 55 percent majority say that ordinary Americans would do a better job of solving the countrys problems than their elected representatives. (Bring back Athenian democracy and pick our reps by lottery!)


Asked to name the biggest problem with elected officials in Washington, Democrats and Republicans alike put the influence of special interest money at the top of their list. Three-quarters overall say there should be limits on campaign spending.


One-quarter of the public has an unfavorable view of both major parties, up from 12 percent in 2008.




The Economist reviews the results of the open data revolution and asks why more has not been achieved. The answers it offers: First, the data that have been made available are often useless. Second, the data engineers and entrepreneurs who might be able to turn it all into useful, profitable products find it hard to navigate. Third, too few people are capable of mining data for insights or putting the results to good use. Finally, it has been hard to overcome anxieties about privacy.


Internet companies have tripled their spending on lobbying in Washington, D.C. in the last five years, and while much of that comes from giants Google and Facebook, new companies reliant on freelance workers in the on-demand economy are accounting for a rising chunk, reports Cecilia Kang for the New York Times.


Scaremongering: Keep an eye on Trump Card LLC, a guerilla campaign aimed at destroying Donald Trumps presidential candidacy, being launched by Liz Mair, former online communications director for the Republican National Committee (and a friend of PDM), as reported by Beth Reinhard and Janet Hook for the Wall Street Journal.


Asked about the initiative on ABCs This Week show, Trump said that if the Republican establishment knocked him out of the race by not treating him fairly he would be open to running as an independent, Laura Meckler reports for the Wall Street Journal. He also declared his support for bringing back waterboarding, and doubled down on his claim that thousands of Arab-Americans living in New Jersey celebrated when the World Trade Center towers fell in 2001.


Keep calm and tweet a cat: When Belgian authorities asked social media users to stop sharing details of the anti-terror lockdown underway there in the wake of the Paris attacks, people responded by flooding the #Bruxelles and #BrusselsLockdown hashtags with cute cat memes aimed at relieving the stress of the moment and mocking ISIS, Alia Dastagir reports for USA Today.


This suggests that Ethan Zuckermans cute cat theory of digital activism needs amending. If you recall, he argues that its good that activists rely on popular public platforms that most people use for sharing mundane media like cute cat photos because their very popularity makes it harder for governments to shut those platforms down. Here the government effectively shut down a popular news channel, but since that action was widely supported, people responded by sharing more cute cat photos. Ipso facto, the more something attracts cat memes, the more popular it is. Or, perhaps more simply: the opposite of terror is a cute cat.


In Sundays New York Times, technosociologist Zeynep Tufecki offers a sober explanation why weakening encrypted communications tools like WhatsApp wont stop terrorists.


This is civic tech: Seamus Kraft of the OpenGov Foundation posts an update on the work they are doing with the Chicago City Council to modernize its legislative systems. He writes: Together, were overhauling the internal policy-making process to include Google Docs-style collaboration with a commitment to open data formats. Citizens will be able to stay on top of (and be heard in) city council business through a user-friendly system. Were creating a scalable software suite to support more efficient, effective and accountable legislative operations with fewer paper-based headaches and hassles. Success is a flexible open source operating system built with the Chicago City Council that is fully adaptable to the unique realities and culture of any city, state and county legislative body.

In 2011, Philadelphia was roiling over proposed changes to a retirement program for city employees that had cost the city $258 million in the decade after it was implemented in 1999. Mayor Michael Nutter wanted to cut the program all together, whereas Council members (some of whom benefited from the plan) wanted to merely scale it back. Mjumbe Poe, then a Code for America fellow, recalls that with the way it was being covered, I wasnt really getting what was going on. So he started digging for primary source material, trying to get at the root of the issue. Thats where he ran into trouble.
My options were limited, Poe tells Civicist. Generally pretty poor. The citys legislative portal, Legistar, was even less user-friendly then than it is now.
In addition to looking for background information, Poe wanted to be notified when things he was interested in came up in City Council meetings. That February, at one of the weekly hacknights he organized as a Code for America fellow, Poe led an introduction to scraping and, as an example, scraped the council minutes and agenda from Legistar. At another hacknight later that month, a team took his idea and built the first subscription service, an RSS feed that would send items with your search terms to an RSS reader. It was the earliest iteration of Councilmatic, an open government tool that was implemented in Chicago in 2013 and New York City just this year.
NYC Councilmatic, which launched earlier this fall at the Code for America Summit, is a project by the nonprofit Participatory Politics Foundation (PPF) in partnership with the civic technology company DataMade, and supported by Rita Allen Foundation. Like the original Councilmatic in Philadelphia, people can use NYC Councilmatic to find and track laws, resolutions, and other City Council activities on a more user-friendly platform than the official Legistar portal. In addition, David Moore, the executive director of PPF, is adding or boosting features meant to increase public participation, for example: highlighting legislation on the home page to draw visitors in; reaching out to local community groups to invite them to use the comment forum; and partnering with a text-messaging service to make the platform more accessible.

Improving on a citys official legislative portal is a relatively easy task, but NYC Councilmatic aspires to a higher bar: to demystify the New York City Council.
Pure legislative transparency alone isnt going to give a site as much impact as we want it to have, Moore tells Civicist. (Full disclosure: David Moore is a Civic Hall member.) Open data alone isnt enough.
But, Moore adds, if you provide official information in a shareable format with participation tools, you can see communities organically coming together to take action. To illustrate his point, Moore points to a 2010 techPresident article by Civic Halls Micah Sifry about how the unemployed were coming together on platforms like OpenCongressan open government platform at the federal level that PPF developed and operated until it was acquired by the Sunlight Foundation in 2013in de facto, organizing networks and self-help communities. In the same piece, Sifry noted that three bills about unemployment benefits had garnered more than 130,000 comments on OpenCongress.
Its been proven that on sites like OpenCongress and OpenGovernment.org [like OpenCongress but for states], people come together around their interests, to share information, says Moore. This is the model that weve been working to bring to city governments for the past four years and with Councilmatic its finally happening.
Councilmatic started as an off-the-cuff project during a hacknight, so the blocks to make it easily replicable werent in place.
I didnt put a lot of effort into making it easy to deploy in other places, Mjumbe Poe tells Civicist. It was always a desire, but it was a side project from the beginning.
It took longer than expected, says Derek Eder, of repurposing the platform in Chicago. Derek Eder co-founded the civic hacking group Open City, which got Chicago Councilmatic up and running, and founded DataMade, which is a partner on NYC Councilmatic.
In addition to not being familiar with the code base, Eder points out that significant differences in the way Chicago and Philadelphias city councils work necessitated extra features. Eder says the Chicago City Council can go through 1,000 pieces of legislation per meeting. He and Forest Gregg, a colleague at both Open City and DataMade, decided to automatically tag items as routine or non-routine, to make it easier for visitors to find their way to things of interest.
Eder and Gregg launched the platform in Chicago in June 2013, on the National Day of Civic Hacking. That month, Eder wrote a guest post for the Sunlight Foundation inviting hackers from other cities interested in doing something similar to get in touch. It was also on a list of suggested projects to tackle during a replication marathon that took place earlier this year.
It still took two years to get it up and running in New York City. This is not to slight the work that Eder, Gregg, Moore, and others have put into the NYC Councilmatic platformand as mentioned before, it does include new features and an updated user-experiencebut to draw attention to the challenge of putting out high-quality replications, even when the creators and developers along the way have the best, open-source intentions. Moore says the project would have moved faster, and that Councilmatic would have more features, if they had had more financial support.

NYC Councilmatic now runs on the Open Civic Data (OCD) standard. The Open Civic Data project, an initiative to make open data sets more consistent across organizations, didnt even exist until late last year. Now that it does, Moore says getting Councilmatic up and running in other cities will be much easier.
If a city started publishing in OCD tomorrow, he tells Civicist, we could have them up on Councilmatic...in under a month.
Would Councilmatic be easier to replicate in other cities if it scooted a bit further into govtech territory? If, for example, Moore and co. sold the platform to governments instead of hosting it as a nonprofit organization?
A nonprofit aura makes people participate in ways, says Moore. So were willing to host those conversations on our pages whereas on government websites, that might get too risky or controversial.
But, Moore points out, the influence of sites like Councilmatic can be seen in government technology. For example, the bill status bar that Moore designed for OpenCongress is now a feature of Congress.gov. Moore says they were also the first site to highlight most-viewed bills, and Congress.gov now does the same.

Examples of communities organically congregating around issues of shared concern are harder to find on Councilmatic than on OpenCongress, perhaps because they havent been marketed or presented as engagement tools. Moore points out that NYC Councilmatic is the first to spend resources on filling out a public comment program: reaching out to local groups and inviting them to comment on legislation; partnering with the text-messaging platform HeartGov to further spread the word; etc.
And if the platforms are driving civic engagement offlineincreased attendance at City Council meetings, for exampleits hard to prove.
As for whats next, Mjumbe Poe and Derek Eder are planning on updating Philadelphia and Chicago Councilmatic respectively to include the changes in NYC Councilmatic, which Poe reiterated is a major departure from what came before.
Moore has ambitious goals for getting the platform into more cities around the country. He says hes looking for funders to help fortify the public comment program in New York City and looking for national open data funders to help spread Councilmatic nationwide. Lucky for him, theres no shortage of fields to plow: Theres 20,000 municipalities in the U.S., he tells Civicist, and right now nearly all of their legislative portals are a pain point.

Editorial comment: While the focus of Civicist and this First Post morning round-up is on civic techthe use of technology for public goodwe believe it is also important to pay attention to larger trends as well. Civic tech cannot be neutral. It is for improving the lives of the many, not just the few. It is for expanding and improving democracy, not for narrowing or reducing it. It is for comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. It is for creating a more just and equitable society.


It is not civic to try to close state borders to innocent and desperate refugees fleeing a genocidal dictator. It is not civic to single out people of one religion for special state surveillance and control. To be sure, racist and xenophobic attitudes in America didnt appear out of nowhere a week ago, and many good people have been battling these trends for a very long time. But since the Paris terror attacks, American politics has taken a decidedly darker and meaner turn. The civic tech community should not be silent in the face of these developments. Bad things happen when good people fail to speak up. So, please dear readers, do not click away when we talk about these issues. Join in.


Ill tidings: Thursday night, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said he would certainly implement a database system tracking American Muslims, including signing them up at mosques and giving them a special form of identification. Asked by NBC News Vaughn Hillyard if there was a difference between requiring Muslims to register and requiring Jews to do so in Nazi Germany, he said, You tell me.


As Philip Bump reports for the Washington Post, Trump asserted that he was opposed to a federal registry for gun owners but refused to explain why a database of gun sales would be an invasion of privacy and subject to abuse, while those risks dont concern him with an index of Muslim Americans and migrants.


Not to be out-Trumped, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson compared Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States to rabid dogs, Carrie Dan reports for NBC News. He added, We have to have in place screening mechanisms that allow us to determine who the mad dogs are, quite frankly.


Also Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 289-137 to stop allowing Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the United States until top national security officials certify that they dont pose security risks. When CNN Politics reporter Elisa Labott tweeted that news, adding Statue of Liberty bows head in anguish, she was suspended for two weeks. Eight hours later, she tweeted, Everyone, It was wrong of me to editorialize. My tweet was inappropriate and disrespectful. I sincerely apologize.


Many public figures responded on Twitter to Labotts apology, telling her that she was right to speak up and wrong to apologize, including Twitter investor Chris Sacca, Egyptian democracy activist Wael Ghonim, Daily Beast executive editor Noah Schachtman, Atlantic senior writer James Fallows, documentarian Alex Gibney and Reported.lys Andy Carvin.


The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum issued a highly unusual public statement on Syrian refugees, which read in part: Acutely aware of the consequences to Jews who were unable to flee Nazism, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum looks with concern upon the current refugee crisis. While recognizing that security concerns must be fully addressed, we should not turn our backs on the thousands of legitimate refugees. The Museum calls on public figures and citizens to avoid condemning todays refugees as a group. It is important to remember that many are fleeing because they have been targeted by the Assad regime and ISIS for persecution and in some cases elimination on the basis of their identity.


On the compassionate crowdfunding site YouCaring, people are raising money to personally help resettle Syrian refugees.


More crypto-wars: Ex-CIA director James Woolsey says NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has the blood of Paris on his hands and that he should be convicted of treason and hanged by the neck until hes dead, Bradford Richardson reports for The Hill.


GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul told a crowd of undergraduates at George Washington University that, When they stand up on television and say, the tragedy in Paris means you have to give up your liberty, we need more phone surveillancebullshit! as David Weigel and Jose DelReal report for the Washington Post.


Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also tells the Post, Frankly I think the speed with which surveillance hawks leapt ahead of the factsblaming everything from Snowden to encryption to surveillance reforms that havent even taken effect yetis likely to backfire. Its so clearly reflexive and not grounded in any kind of concrete evidence about this specific case. Playing on peoples fears to shut down debate was a pretty effective strategy for many years after 9/11, but I think we saw in the debate over the USA Freedom Act that its lost a lot of its effectiveness.


Tech bubbles: Yesterday, on his Facebook page, tech investor and founder of Code.org Hadi Partovi asked Mark Zuckerberg if the newsfeed algorithm can help decrease Americas political divide. He wrote:
My feed shows only pro-immigrant posts, boosted by Likes from my pro-immigrant friends. Im certain there are anti-immigrants on Facebook, and in their network they may see a unanimous chorus in the opposite direction. Perhaps the algorithm amplifies a divide, and can it somehow make our world slightly more connected? With dialogue we can build bridges not walls, but not if we dont even see posts from those whose viewpoints differ.


An hour later, Zuckerberg replied, arguing that Newsfeed actually shows much *more* diverse opinions than youd typically see on any other media, and citing a 2012 research paper by Facebook data scientist Eytan Bakshy that argued that users in 2010 were getting the vast majority of information..from contacts that they interact with infrequently. Its kind of crazy that Zuckerberg is relying on five-year-old data to argue that Newsfeed doesnt form echo chambersespecially when you consider that Facebook has made several major changes in the Newsfeed algorithm since 2010 (adding more hard news to it, for example).


Pressed by another Silicon Valley VC, Sherwin Pishevar, to consider if there might be creative ways for the feed/algorithm to present opposing views from friends, friends and friends and even strangers, Zuckerberg admitted Theres always more to do and we always think about this in our work. But then he dug in his heels, writing, My point was only that the narrative that social media is dividing us based on our own viewpoints is incorrect. It turns out social media is much better for exposing us to diverse viewpoints than anything weve had to date. If you say so, boss.


Talking with TechCrunchs Andrew Keen, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom says American politics needs systemic change, of the kind that Silicon Valley specializes in. Youll have to watch the video to truly appreciate Newsoms facility with Valley buzzwords.


This is civic tech: New on Civicist: Just in time for the release of the final episode of The Hunger Games, Katie Bowers of the Harry Potter Alliance explains how to use pop culture to increase civic engagement.


Good Jobs First has launched Violation Tracker, a database of corporate misconduct that contains 100,000 cases involving government penalties of $5,000 or more issued by the EPA, OSHA, and 11 other government agencies. You can use it to find out which corporations are big violators of environmental, health and safety laws in the United States. Banking, antitrust and wage violations are to be added later.


Stefan Baack has updated his network map of Githubs global civic tech community, noting that it is an inaccurate proxy for that entire community: Individuals or groups who are not using GitHubs social features (such as following or starring) are underrepresented in this data. Moreover, when we talk about civic tech on a global scale we are not only talking about developers. Naturally, activist groups are not using GitHub as much so they are underrepresented as well. Nonetheless, his visualization of the contributor network to GitHub repos is spectacular.

First Post 




The final film in The Hunger Games franchise hits theaters today. Fans will be flocking to theaters to see the conclusion of Panems revolution, but the Harry Potter Alliance is already helping write the next chapter.
Odds in Our Favor is a campaign by the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA) to hack the Hunger Games hype and get people talking about real life economic inequality. The practice of combining pop culture and civic engagement, which HPA co-founder (and Civic Hall fellow) Andrew Slack calls cultural acupuncture, helps leaders detect and redirect societys psychological energy toward real world issues and action.
During the first iteration of the Odds in Our Favor in 2013, HPA asked fans to send in pictures of themselves holding up a three-finger salute to acknowledge that the economic inequality and oppression seen on screen were real world issues. In 2014, when Mockingjay Part 1 was released, we asked fans to share their personal Hunger Games stories around how issues like class, gender, sexuality, race, education, ability, employment impact their lives. These stories showed the reality of economic inequality in the U.S. With over 12,000 people telling their story, we were left wondering: what can we do to impact such a large and complicated issue?
This year, Odds in Our Favor is focused on sharing both stories of oppression and action. Weve partnered with labor unions, nonprofits, artists and activists to form a Coalition of Rebels which provide fans with ways to take action. These partners share in-depth first person stories from the communities they work with at MyHungerGames.org. Each storyfrom Walmart workers to environmental disaster survivors to Syrian refugeesincludes an action that either the storyteller has taken to create change in their community, or that the reader can take to make a difference. Fans are no longer just consuming or even telling the story; theyre participating in shaping it.
At the Harry Potter Alliance, we believe all fans can be heroes. Fans are passionate, enthusiastic, authentic and imaginativefour words usually missing when we talk about politics and civic engagement. Through cultural acupuncture we are using fandom as a force for goodand heres how you can, too.
Follow the Energy
Cultural acupuncture means you dont wait for people discover to your issueyou bring the issue to where they already are. The Hunger Games trilogy was one of the first major literary phenomena after Harry Potter. The energy and excitement was there, and fans were eager to engage with the story and the issues it represented. The Harry Potter Alliance chose to do something that ultimately shaped our organizing going forward: we followed the energy and did our first non-Harry Potter related campaign.
As the franchise grew to include four feature films, the energy continued to grow and to shift. Fans lamented that this story of economic inequality and revolution was being used to sell make-up and Subway sandwiches. We responded to this bizarre marketing by asking fans to tell the real stories of #MyHungerGames. This year, when the conversation shifted to anger and confusion around the Hunger Games theme park, we asked fans to share ideas for attractions that represent the real Hunger Games. Fans suggested $50,000 tickets, juggling acts where performers balance rent, food, and medical, and roller coasters that require three years of experience in order to ride.
By paying attention to Hunger Games fans, and to this particular cultural moment, we created a responsive campaign for engaging fans around issues of inequality.
Work with Partners
As Odds in Our Favor has grown, weve worked with and learned from incredible partners. Having partner organizations on the campaign has allowed us to share stories from incarcerated young people, indigenous activists, mental health advocates, and other communities whose stories often go unheard in mainstream media. Partners also bring the campaign to new audiences: people who follow the partner organizations and use their services gain a new, creative way of engaging with issues they care about. The power of Odds in Our Favor grows, and partner organizers gain another tool for increasing engagement.
From labor unions to international NGOs, weve see civic organizations use cultural acupuncture in incredible ways:


Project UROK created a special #MyHungerGames video series, where people shared stories about mental health and poverty.


OURWalmart and Fight for $15 have used the Hunger Games as a part of their protests, with workers holding up the three-finger salute and rewriting the lyrics to The Hanging Tree.


AFL-CIO have highlighted present-day labor issues in easy-to-read listicles illustrated with eye-catching gifs from the film.


Campaign for Youth Justice adapted their Hands of Support campaign to include the three-finger salute to demonstrate support for incarcerated young people.


HPA chapters have used the Hunger Games to organize their communities around everything from refugee support to climate change education. Weve seen art shows, hunger (games) banquets, donation drives, teach-ins, and more.


An Outlet for Action
Author John Green has long advocated that stories belong to their readers and that it is the imagination of readers that bring narratives to lifewhich we believe means that fans hold the power to continue the narrative long after the series ends.
Through the work of fans and partner organizations, weve done just that with the Odds in Our Favor campaign. Weve shared #MyHungerGames stories from an impressive array of communities: workers, prisoners, refugees, protesters, mental health advocates, climate change survivors, and many more. Each story we share includes a call to action: sign a petition; start a discussion; join a march; tell your story.
With so many diverse partners and issue areas, these stories and calls to action could have sounded like a disjointed cacophony. Instead, weaving The Hunger Games narrative through each story and action has created the lyrics to a collective song that every civic organization should be singing: our issues are entwined, your liberation is bound up with mine, and everyones actions make a difference. In 2015, were witnessing a revolution, and cultural acupuncture is allowing us to understand what that means and imagine ourselves as heroes in the long narrative of history and change.

The crypto wars are back...and with a vengeance in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris. As David Sanger and Nicole Perlroth report for the New York Times, national security and law enforcement officials are renewing their criticism of tech companies that provide end-to-end encryption of their users communications, even though American and French officials say there is still no definitive evidence to back up their presumption that the terrorists who massacred 129 people in Paris used new, difficult-to-crack encryption technologies to organize the plot.


CIA director John Brennan denounced handwringing in the wake of Edward Snowdens disclosures, saying it has allowed terrorists to flourish, Alex Shepherd reports for the New Republic.


Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, responds, As far as I know, theres no evidence the French lacked some kind of surveillance authority that would have made a difference. When weve invested new powers in the government in response to events like the Paris attacks, they have often been abused.


Also on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio criticized two of his rivals, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, for voting to weaken the U.S. intelligence program and leav[e] America vulnerable, Patrick OConnor reports for The Wall Street Journal.


Rethinking the sharing economy: Last Friday and Saturday, more than a thousand people attended the Platform Cooperativism conference at The New School. The event, which was organized by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Schneider (and grew out of an earlier panel event at Civic Hall this past spring), was filled with passionate debate about the prospects of organizing a different approach to the ownership and governance of the emerging on-demand economy, as Jay Cassano reports for Shareable.


Maybe Uber isnt that much of an economic juggernaut. Thats the argument of economist Lawrence Mishel, writing in The Atlantic, who points out that Uber drivers represent significantly less than 0.1 percent of all full-time-equivalent employment. He adds, Even using [Uber senior adviser David] Plouffes current count of 400,000 Uber drivers, all working 10 percent fewer hours than in 2014, then Uber could account for between 0.1 to 0.14 percent of total full-time-equivalent employment at the end of 2015.


This is civic tech: Mark Cridge, the new director of mySociety, has written an excellent statement on Why we do what we do. He writes:
What links all of our work is the creation of civic technology that enables greater access for citizens to the work of government and the democratic process: Lack of access to elected representatives amongst disadvantaged or underrepresented groups is a key driver of exclusion and inequality, yet governments tend only to become better at serving the needs of citizens when those citizens are capable of demanding better. Simply put, this is our cause.

Tech vs. terror: BuzzFeeds Brendan Klinkenberg reports on how several leading tech platforms, including Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Uber, and Twitter responded to the terror attacks in Paris. Facebook activated its safety check tool, helping 4.1 million people alert their friends and family that they were safe. Uber turned off surge pricing in Paris. Airbnb urged local hosts to make their homes available for free or low cost. Twitter users crowded around the hashtag #PorteOuverte to help Parisians find sanctuary. And Google made international calls to France free via Hangouts.


Facebook faced criticism for not having used safety check for other non-Western crises, and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly responded that in the future, the giant social network will implement its safety check feature for more human disasters, as Alex Howard reports for the Huffington Post. While the option was activated in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, it had not been offered to users in the wake of suicide bombings in Beirut two days earlier.


Facebooks vice president of growth, Alex Schultz, also said the company will explore giving users options to show support for other things that they care about through their Facebook profiles, a reference to the companys enabling users to add the silhouette of Frances tricolor flag to their profiles. As Howard astutely notes, The criteria that will be used to determine which issues and events users will be able to show support for, however, arent clear. No option has been offered to users to show solidarity with the people of Lebanon or Syria, for example.


As you consider Facebooks emerging approach to human disasters, keep in mind that its CEO is still hungry to crack the one global market the company has yet to penetrate: China. He says, We care about all people equally, and we will work hard to help people suffering in as many of these situations as we can. We shall see.


How many gigs in the gig economy? Lydia dePillis takes a behind-the-scenes look for the Washington Post on how an unusual group of tech companies, labor advocates, and think-tankers came together to call for new benefits for people working in the gig economy.


One interesting angle dePillis notes: not all economists agree with the Freelancers Unions assessment that 53 million people are independent workers. Official numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest its more like 15 million. Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute says, Its not true, and I think its in service of making people think that things are changing much faster than they are, and that therefore the legal models that we have shouldnt be applied, says Eisenbrey. Thats Ubers wish, that they escape from employment obligations, that they not have to pay minimum wage and overtime. I think that something like this could be misused.


Debatable: For the first time in my memory, a live presidential debate included a real-time question from someone watching that was in response to something one of the candidates said. As Alexandra Petri points out for the Washington Post, the tweet came in response to Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons assertion that her millions in Wall Street connected donations were because of her hard work helping the financial sector rebuild after 9/11. Ive never seen a candidate invoke 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations until now, wrote Andy Grewal, at 10:07pm the night of the debate. Moments later, his question was posed directly to Clinton. (Grewal, who says he admires Bernie Sanders but thinks his tax plan is too radical, has since jokingly offered to retract his tweet in exchange for 10% of [Hillarys] Wall Street donations.

Todays must-reads: New America president (and Civic Hall founding partner) Anne-Marie Slaughter and Open Technology Institute senior adviser Ben Scott say its time for think tanks to become civic enterprises. They explain:
Civic because it engages citizens as change makersconscious members of a self-governing polity that expects government to be at least part of the solution to problems that individuals cannot solve on their own. And enterprise because of the energy and innovation involved in actually making change on the ground. Civic enterprise blends conventional policy research with local organizing, coalition building, public education, advocacy, and bottom-up projects that generate and test ideas before, during, and after engagement in the policymaking process with government.


They add: The pendulum of American political history is swinging toward democratizing technocracy, giving people more opportunity to participate in self-government. This is particularly powerful in an era when many citizens doubt the power and value of their vote. Civic enterprise is about knocking down the walls and partitions that have grown up between the policy class and the citizens we purport to serve. Amen to that!

Tech and the presidentials: Tech policy hasnt really surfaced yet as an issue in the presidential campaign, but during last nights Republican debate, rising contender Marco Rubio did say this: It took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach 100 million users. [Laughter.] So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Rubio, who opposes net neutrality, wasnt asked how he thought the next Candy Crush would grow that rapidly if we lose the open internet.


Rival Floridian Jeb Bush had this to say about that issue, kind of: On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them. And start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.

I don't want to be photographed. (Josh Levinger)

Civic hackathons, those technology-driven sprints for good, are both popular and potentially problematic. They can be exciting, stirring passions around important social issues. They offer the promise of improving lives. But they also risk squandering resources, producing tools that are often quickly abandoned, or at worst create unintended harm.


A common and valid criticism of hackathons is that they often rely on technologists with little or inaccurate knowledge of the selected cause.
Ask a bunch of upper-middle-class 20-somethings to improve access to healthy food, and youll invariably end up with a grocery store map. A person living in a food desert might have instead pointed out that the barriers to healthier eating are logistical, economic, and cultural, not purely informational. A food justice advocate might have suggested advancing substantial policy changes for long term gains. But at most hackathonswhich generally run between six hours to a full weekendtime feels too short for such deep dives, and the need to produce a product can take priority over making sustainable impacts.
Making effective use of a hackathons focused, skilled, and cheap labor requires a more informed and humble approach. Anticipating this, some organizers recruit and engage participants with experiences that can inform the technical work. This focus on listening, questioning, and context is a great evolution, but, especially when dealing with sensitive issues and vulnerable populations, it introduces new risks.


Last month, I facilitated a portion of the Refugee Hackathon in Berlin, Germany. The event spanned three days, gathering nearly 300 developers and refugees to exchange ideas and create tools that ease the experience of being a refugee in Germany. It was the perfect combination of pertinent politics and optimistic technology; in short, it was a total media spectacle.


A key strength of the hackathon was the involvement of people with actual refugee experiencepeople who either were themselves refugees to Germany or who volunteer with newcomers. Theirs was a unique and powerful story, and its retelling has influence beyond one humble hackathon. But as the event unfolded, it became clear that maintaining a safe space for these vulnerable people to fully participate conflicted with the media presence.


The image of the noble technologist uplifting the helpless refugee (to apply a lazy stereotype) supports valuable narratives for many. The technologists get to look like heroes, with a new project for their portfolios. The event organizers receive attention for their popular event, which bolsters their credentials. Members of the media profit directly from collecting interviews and photos, as this is their job. But also indirectly, the mainstream German community benefits as it consumes this positive coverage, allowing them to feel like the crisis is being addressed.
Media coverage for a feel-good event is good for many, but how does it affect the people this event was intended to supportin this case, the refugees? Many participated on the explicit understanding that they would not be named, photographed, or filmed. These people came to Berlin to escape violence, leaving friends and family back home. I heard from several individuals worried that if those violent actors could identify them as having fled, friends and family they left behind would become targets. As facilitators, it was our duty to manage these priorities and craft an appropriate space.
We offered a photo opt out system. We provided red stickers, which, if put on a name tag, identified the individual as someone who did not consent to being photographed. We posted several signs explaining this system at registration and around the workshop spaces in four languages and with language-agnostic iconography. The facilitators took several opportunities to remind the room not to photograph people with red stickers. We asked the individuals with privacy concerns to raise their hands so everyone would know to avoid them in photos.
We also instructed the group that we would be following Chatham House Rules:
When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

These rules are very popular at workshops where delicate information is to be shared, because it allows people to engage fully in the conversation.


In spite of these precautions, we still encountered several instances of worrisome media behavior. Some reporters were very respectful, chatting easily and maintaining a comfortable atmosphere. Others either missed the precautionary notices, or simply chose to disregard them. Eventually, two core issues emerged: obtaining informed consent and minimizing disruptions.
With so many media seeking group photos, the red sticker opt-out system quickly became difficult to enforce. When photographers did seek consent, the consent was not always informed.
One incident occurred when a reporter invited a French-speaking refugee to be photographed. Echoing a broader issue of underestimated diversity among Germanys refugees, we had not anticipated the need to support French translation, so communicating with these refugees was problematic. The refugee asked where the photos would appear, the volunteer translator used his basic French to communicate an answer, and the refugee left with the reporter. Interestingly, the translator was not invited, because the journalist had no interest in what his subject had to say. Instead, the reporter posed the man outside for a few generic photos of a downcast refugee. Later, the refugee became concerned: he had understood that the photographer worked for the event organizers and did not want his photos published by a reporter. The translator flagged down a facilitator, and the photographer ultimately relented and deleted the photos. Effectively, the refugee hadnt known what he was consenting to do, and the photographer hadnt been clear about the potential consequences.
Even among the main language groups, the conspicuous cameras and frequent requests to borrow refugees and project managers led to constant disruptions. Remember: the explicit purpose of this workshop was to learn about the refugee experience firsthand from the refugees, identifying specific requirements and possible interventions. Allowing press to coerce participants into being shared soured the mood for many, and reduced the effectiveness of the event overall. The refugees werent the only ones visibly uncomfortable with the media presencetwice I overheard conversations among developers abruptly conclude or shift when a large television camera rolled up.
As facilitators, we could have better anticipated and mitigated the chilling effect of these reporters, writers, and photographers. Learning from these experiences, here are seven things organizers can do to protect privacy during a workshop.




    Offer an opt-out indicator that is very visible. We gave out stickers. We asked people opting out to raise their hands in front of the group. We gave polite but firm reminders when we saw violations. But still, we ended up spending a lot of time enforcing this system, instead of focusing on facilitating better outcomes. Our tiny stickers could have been much bigger. We could have given out red t-shirts, or at least a different color lanyards.
These identifiers should be visible if their wearer is across the room or turned away, and they should stand out in accidental photographs to ensure proper deletion.
Ensure consent is both sought and informed every time. If theres a risk the meaning isnt wholly understood, take the time to find a better explanation. All photos can wait.
Discourage people from opting out of photos for solidarity. This one is controversial, and deserves discussion. Everyone should want to support people who need to opt-out from photography, but as I experienced it, we cant do that by diminishing the seriousness of those requests. I attended an event years ago where only one person opted out. We paused to wave at him, and he stood behind the camera for group photos. Because he was easy to remember, we all scanned the room to find him before taking any photo, ever. We made it easier to take safe photos by reducing the number of people to actively avoid photographing.
As a participant, support opt-out requests. If someone prefers not to be photographed, actively locate them as being outside your frame before snapping a photo. Keep an eye out for cameras at the event, and help review photos on social media later. If you see a consent violation, either intervene politely and firmly, or seek out a facilitator.
As a facilitator, empower your team both to enforce privacy requests and minimize disruptions. You want your participants to feel comfortable handling or reporting issues, and you want your team to feel comfortable taking appropriate action.
Allow for non-disruptive media engagement. If you expect a media presence, carve out time, space, or people where press can safely participate. Media access does not need to be a default.
Anticipate how skewed media access could misrepresent your event. A few of our participants arrived with fully formed projects, and put the time we dedicated to listening to refugees towards courting the media. As a result, projects with the least refugee input came to occupy a disproportionate amount of exposure from the refugee-legitimized event.



Hackathons can be fun, inspiring, or challenging, and its natural for people to want to capture these experiences. As the hackathon model continues to evolve, and acknowledges the diversity of experiences needed for success, privacy and safety must become key operating principles.

Todays whither democracy must-read: Pollsters rose to prominence by claiming that measuring public opinion is good for democracy. But what if its bad? Thats the core question running through historian Jill Lepores trenchant report for the New Yorker on the rise of the polling industry.

Youll want to read Lepores essay for nuggets like this one: In 1977, the R.N.C. acquired a mainframe computer, while the D.N.C. got its own mainframe in the eighties....Democratic technological advances awaited the personal computer; the R.N.C. is to I.B.M. as the D.N.C. is to Apple.

GovDelivery, the marketing and communications platform for governments and nonprofits, announced today that they have passed the 100 million users mark. First deployed in Minnesota in 2001, GovDelivery has since extended its reach worldwide. Recent acquisitions, notably the open source data software company NuCivic in 2014 and the text-messaging civic startup Textizen earlier this year, have expanded its capabilities.
In a conversation with Civicist yesterday, CEO Scott Burns described what GovDelivery does as funnelingmoving citizens toward a desired outcome, like signing up for healthcare, for example.
Burns told Civicist that for the first few years, GovDelivery was mostly about functionalityhelping clients send out messages when they needed. In 2007 they made it about reachabout sending out messages at scale.
If we went to Best Buy and asked if it was better to reach 50,000 people than 25,000, they would of course say yes, Burns said. Its not always that obvious for governmentbut whatever is at the bottom of the funnel, twice as much reach is good regardless.
One way that GovDelivery leverages its reach in governments favor is by suggesting new users sign up to receive notices from agencies that are geographically or topically related to the agency that first attracted them to the platform.
Reach is everything, Burns said, explaining the significance of the 100 million user mark. You could have the best [communications strategy] in the world and if it doesnt connect with an audience its like a tree falling in the forest.
We could spend all day arguing over the difference between civic versus government tech...but anything thats impacting those areas at scale is a good thing, whatever you call it, Burns said.
When asked if GovDelivery is trying to transition from being a one-way email blast system to a two-way conversation between government and citizens, Burns said that thinking about GovDelivery as merely an email blast system is a misconception.
Citizens talking to government, thats like a bottom of the funnel activity, Burns explained. GovDeliverys strength is pushing people to the conversation, not facilitating the conversation itself.
There are lots of cases of just amplifying voices that are already being heard, Burns said. GovDeliverys contribution is expanding the number of participants in those initiatives.
Another goal of GovDelivery is facilitating positive interactions with government in the hope that those experiences will dispel the cynicism Burns believes pervades American cities.
For me, you need to distinguish between citizen experience and citizen engagement, Burns said. GovDelivery is more about megovernment than wegovernment. What that means is getting citizen services right...making the citizen experience with government more positive.
Burns points to low voter turnoutonly 13 percent of eligible voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, participated in the recent electionas a symptom of cynicism and the belief that government just doesnt work.
An extraordinary citizen experience is the only hope we have for promoting more positive citizen engagement, Burns concluded.

First, the bad news: While home-renting home-sharing start-up Airbnb has taken steps to protect hosts from unruly guests, its done little to protect guests from unsafe hosts beyond inviting them to down-rate them after a bad experience. Writing for Mediums Matter section, Zak Stone tells the harrowing story of his fathers untimely death trying out a tree swing at an Airbnb rental (the tree was rotten to the core and fell on him), pointing out that the company disclaims all liability and does nothing to insure that its hosts properties are safe, unlike traditional B&B services. Stone makes a damning indictment, pointing out that the company has been willing to spend money on improving what their hosts do when it fits its business model. He notes that it figured out early on that ugly photos of its listing in New York City were keeping guests away, so it invested in hiring professional photographers to document properties for free. He writes:
Of course, were Airbnb to invest in safety requirements by offering home inspections or by analyzing photo content to target higher-risk properties and features (pools, saunas, trampolines, etc.) with site-specific safety recommendations, such a program could be far more costly, and might jeopardize Airbnbs covetable neutrality as a platform. The irony is that amateur innkeepers who couldnt be trusted with the banal task of photographing and marketing their properties are expected to excel at hospitalitys most important rule: keeping guests safe and alive. The result: Airbnb is willing to send someone to make sure your trees look beautiful in their photos, but wont deal with whether or not those trees will fall on your head.


While predatory payday lenders have been pushed into the shadows by statewide crackdowns, Jack Smith IV of Mic.com reports on a new study from the civil rights data consulting firm Upturn that how they hide on the other end of Google searches, waiting for terms like need help paying rent to offer their services. He notes that Facebook bans all payday loan ads, while Googles approach is more porous.

Rush hour in New York (Giacomo Carena/Flickr)

Headlines about the tussle between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Uber have for the most part subsided, but behind the scenes, the citys four-month traffic study on the impact of for-hire vehicle services on congestion and pollution is well underway. The study, which is being conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey, will draw on city traffic data as well as trip information provided by Uber, and will also incorporate input from a Technology Advisory Group that the city has convened. The biggest underrepresented group in the process are New York City residents, but a cross-disciplinary research team from Cornell University hopes to change that.
Building on more than five years of experience moderating federal rulemaking processes, the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative (CeRI) is positioning their discussion platform Smart Participation as the publics official comment section, where drivers, public transit users, alternative transit users, community groups, and regular Joes can come and weigh in on specific aspects of congestion policy that have been clearly explained in plain language.
Our concern is for a fair process that gives the people at least as much weight as the experts and the officials, says Joshua Brooks, an eGovernment Fellow at Cornell.
Comment sections on news sites or link-sharing sites are notoriously bad, whether for being inappropriate or unproductive or both. To make this a worthwhile enterprise, Smart Participation is staffed around the clock by Cornell Law student moderators.
Moderators mentor or guide commenters with the purpose of turning underrepresented stakeholders comments into effective and persuasive comments that demand the attention of the decisionmakers, explains Brooks.
The site quietly went live in late October. Brooks tells Civicist that they didnt want an avalanche of comments, but more of a slow trickle. Consequently, the participation thus far is predictably low. Brooks says they plan on ramping up publicity through November, and will keep the platform live until at least December 1, the same day that the McKinsey study will conclude, although that date might be extended by a week to give more residents a chance to respond.
The comments will then be collected and synthesized into a report that the Cornell group will send to local and state politicians. Earlier this week, Brooks reached out to political figuresmembers of the New York State Assembly transportation committee, for exampleto ask them to agree to receive and consider the report upon its release. Their names are currently embargoed but will likely be made public by the end of the month.
The Smart Participation report should be a welcome addition to the contributions of the Technology Advisory Group, an informal, drop-in, drop-out group which includes companies like Uber, Lyft, and Via, as well as representatives from Union Square Ventures, the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, and the Columbia Earth Institute, among others. Such informality unfortunately seems to come with corresponding opacity for the outside observer.
Smart Participation, in contrast, is truly open to anyone and is conducted in the open and led by an impartial group.
The target issue has been broken down into six topics:


Congestion Contributors: Private Vehicles?


Congestion Contributors: E-Hails (Uber, etc.)? Other FHVs?


Congestion Contributors: Trucks, bikes, buses, and everything else?


The Move NY Fair Plan [a plan by local groups and transit experts, whose leaders agreed to submit the plan for public comment and consider feedback generated on Smart Participation]


Money Problems. Solutions?


How to Improve Area Transportation


Each of those is then broken down into additional subtopics. There are lengthy but straightforward explanations for each subtopic, written by Cornell Law faculty and students, and at the end there are specific questions like, Do you think congestion charges should be part of the solution to NYC congestion? Which kind would be fairest and most effective? Links to news articles and sources are generously sprinkled throughout.
In addition to the Discussion pages, Smart Participation also includes existing testimonytranscripts from Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewers September hearing on the subject, for exampleto help visitors make an educated contribution to the discussion.
RegulationRoom
The Cornell eRulemaking Initiative (CeRI), overseen by law professor Cynthia Farina, first launched the online platform RegulationRoom in 2010, as part of a partnership with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to seek public comment on a proposed ban of texting by commercial truck and bus drivers. They have partnered with the DOT on several occasions since then and twice with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Most of the proposals garnered thousands of visitors and hundreds of comments on the RegulationRoom site.
When RegulationRoom first launched, the official government eRulemaking site was Regulations.gov, where visitors could submit comments through electronic forms. The proposals were announced only in the official journal of the U.S. government, the Federal Register, but as CFPB Director Richard Cordray observed in 2014, on the whole, people do not read the Federal Register. When CeRI partnered with the DOT, they began reaching out to interested parties on Facebook and Twitter, something Farina told Nextgov in 2010 was not something that as far as we can tell the agency would normally do.
Brooks tells Civicist that Obamas open government initiative was a big impetus for the project.
Our partnership with Cornell on the e-rule-making initiative is an important step toward keeping President Obamas promise of opening government to more effective citizen participation, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has said.
CeRI receives support from Google and IBM, among others. The financial security they enjoy ensures that they can offer their services for freeas in the case of Smart Participation in New York Cityand take more chances than a less-well-funded project could.
In addition to the reports generated by public comments, CeRI also produces research and publications on civic engagement and participatory processes based on their work running an e-rulemaking platform.
Transition to Local Level
Smart Participation is an experiment to see how the processes developed at the federal level will do in local contexts. It was something the CeRI team had been thinking about when the de Blasio-Uber war over congestion solutions erupted this summer, and they decided it seemed like a promising issue to tackle.
There are some crucial differences between local and federal policy-making. First of all, federal agencies have a legal obligation to consider public comments when finalizing rules, and there were processes, albeit antiquated ones, in place to do so when CeRI got involved. There is no such requirement at the local level, and so CeRI cannot partner with decision-makers in the same way they partner with federal agencies.
Joshua Brooks says that this has put the team, for the first time, in the position of being a scrappy upstart initiative, calling local politicians offices to see if they will agree to read and respond to their report.
Brooks described the transition to the local level as kind of hard and cool and exciting. The biggest challenge is positioning themselves as an authority, which is harder without the official partnerships they enjoy at the federal level.
Brooks wants to get the various stakeholders to agree to publicly say they will read and consider the Cornell report. When we last spoke, he said several had agreed privately to read the report but were reluctant to make a public announcement.
As for how they will judge success, thats still mostly to be determined. Brooks says that the goal is more, better participation, that obviously quality is more important than quantityhence the moderatorsbut that there is a certain threshold for quantity that they need to meet in order to gain necessary credibility.
Hopefully when the de Blasio-Uber conflict inevitably picks up again (which seems likely once the citys McKinsey study is done) the conversation with be at least a little more nuanced, courtesy of more, better public participation.

New YorkOpen GovernmentParticipatory Democracy 





Warning shot: Proposition F, the controversial San Francisco ballot measure that would have curbed short-term home rentals, lost with 45 percent of the vote Tuesday, as did a proposed 18-month moratorium on new market-rate development in the Mission neighborhood, Emily Badger reports for the Washington Post. But as she notes, the issue of housing affordability in San Francisco isnt about to go away.
    

Airbnbs Chris Lehane, who spearheaded the companys massive lobbying effort against Prop F, lauded the vote on the companys policy blog as A victory for the middle class. The longtime Democratic political operatives language notably refers repeatedly to middle class families right to share their home and the home sharing community, though as best as I can tell very few hosts on Airbnb actually share their homes with anyone, according to the words old-fashioned dictionary definition. George Orwell would be proud of Lehane.


As Conor Dougherty and Mike Isaac report for the New York Times, companies like Airbnb and Uber are fighting local regulators by turning their users into a vast political operation that can be mobilized at any sign of a threat. With that in mind, they describe Lehanes Prop F victory press conference in San Francisco as a warning shot to other cities thinking about proposing new regulations.


Indeed, its hard not to read Lehanes blog post without thinking of Airbnb as a political campaignone that is steeped in the data-driven field organizing techniques honed by the Obama campaigns. He writes: This election was a victory for the middle class and it was made possible by the 138,000 members of the Airbnb community who had individual conversations with over 105,000 voters, knocked on 285,000 doors, including 55,000 today, and worked to generate support from more than 2,000 small, family-owned businesses in the city. This effort shows that home sharing is both a community and a movement.


While were on the topic of Orwellian language (aka Spinglish), David Plouffe, President Obamas former campaign manager and now the chief adviser and board member of Uber, recently shared this post on Ubers Under the Hood policy blog, titled Racing to rideshare. It too makes no mention of anyone charging anyone else for anything and brags repeatedly about Uber as a ridesharing service.


Campaign tech: Matt Lira, the former deputy executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (and a friend of PDM), says the reason why Republicans are getting beat by Democrats in the small-donor fundraising game isnt something technological, like the lack of unifying one-click donation platform like ActBlue: This is a cultural challenge. The largest Republican campaigns and organizations simply are not synced up on this issue; greater cooperation in this area would have an outsized influence on the problem.


User rights: Responding to Mondays release of the Ranking Digital Rights report, Yahoos Business and Human Rights Program has blogged that it is actively studying the results of the Index and will be discussing the findings with our teams. We are also looking forward to the important conversations that RDRs Index will spark about company disclosures and policies affecting users free expression and privacy.


Its not an explicit response to the report, but yesterday Twitter announced a new policy hub where the company plans to centralize information about the companys political efforts as well as policy issues affecting its users. We heart that.


Culture wars:The long-running reality TV show Mythbusters just announced that next years season will be its last, and on the New York Times oped page, James Meigs, the former editor of Popular Mechanics, pens a lovely piece praising it for having taught a whole generation how science works and why it matters.


Deep, deep lobbying: If you wonder where so much bad thinking about cyber-security policy comes from, set aside time to read William Arkin and Alexa OBriens detailed report for Vice News on The Most Militarized Universities in America. The rankings are based on a dataset of more than 90,000 individuals who have worked in the intelligence community since 9/11, which is just six percent of all the people in the US with a Top Secret clearance, and they document a vast expansion in national security academic funding. They write:
The gloomy result is that the academy (and by extension the philanthropic world) has failed to establish a post-9/11 academic program to cultivate the next generation of scholars who can offer a genuinely civilian counter-narrative to the national security state similar to the civilian arms control community created during the Cold War. Even at the most elite schools that rank in the top 100, the many centers and research institutes focusing on warfare and terrorism are predominantly adjuncts of the national security state


Eric Raymond, the author of the influential open-source bible The Cathedral and the Bazaar, has turned to the bizarre world of manospheric derangement, Jesse Singal writes for New York magazine. How so? By elevating a totally unsourced allegation that women-in-tech feminists have been trying to entrap men using honey pots and then accusing them of attempted assault, and that their chief target is the founder of Linux, Linus Torvalds. Singals eloquent take-down is worth reading not just for its depressing content but also for its style: The peristaltic movement of the misogynist web finally nudged the story to its inevitable destination... Now that is writing, my friends.

Debates 2.0: Welcome aboard Christine Cupaiuolo, our new Civic Engagement Fellow, who will be leading our Rethinking Debates project. Shell be reporting on how political debates around the world are using innovative formats and social media, focusing on examples that help make these crucial public events more informative, engaging, and responsive to the concerns of voters. Heres her first post.


This is civic tech: Writing for Mediums Backchannel, Susan Crawford reports on a pioneering open data project in Louisville, Kentucky, where the citys commitment to make all municipal public information open by default combined with a local business focused on serving the blind and the local Civic Data Alliance produced a drastically improved version of Open Street Map that can now support many new third-party apps and services.


Columbus, Ohio, is the home of the worlds first B-celerator, reports Susan Post for Metropreneur, where David All and Christine Deye of Civic Hacks are focusing on helping new businesses through the process of becoming certified as B-corporations. (Yes, thats the same David All who was once Rep. Jack Kingstons communications director and the vanguard of a pod of young Republicans who pressed their party to embrace technology before it was cool.)


Theres a lot of nascent civic tech in this new round of Knight Prototype Fund grantees, each of whom is getting $35,000 in support, design training, and peer networking opportunities. The winners include Billcam (which aims to add transparency to the legislative process), CityGram (which makes it easier for local governments to connect with citizens), the U.S. Vote Foundations local election dates and deadlines API, IdeaMapr (which helps communities understand and join in on local government decision making), and @Stake by Emerson Colleges Engagement Lab.


Bryan Breckenridge and Anne Maloney of Box.org have authored a useful whitepaper on why its important to fund tech for nonprofits. They note that currently, most nonprofits spend no more than 10 percent of their budgets on tech, and many large NGOs allocate only 1 percent  2.5 percent of their annual income to tech. They add:
For many organizations that do fund tech, theyve limited it to the sexiest areas of program-side investment while ignoring an organizations need to shore up its foundational data and content collection, management, analytics, and sharing layer... the plumbing: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Constituent Relationship Management), ECM (Enterprise Content Management), Identity Management, communications systems, productivity and collaboration tools, grant management, etc. and the headcount and know-how to run them well. Underinvestment and lacking capacity in plumbing are two of the main reasons organizations struggle to scale overall and rise and crash in a highly turbulent project-to-project life cycle.


Speaking of which, Google.org is giving $2.35 million to community organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area that are on the forefront of the racial justice movement, Jessica Guynn reports for USA Today. The funding includes two grants of $500,000 to the Ella Baker Center in Oakland, one to support Patrisse Cullors of Black Lives Matter, and another to support a worker training program.


Our troubled times: A new study from Common Sense Media finds new evidence of the digital divides impact on young people. As Natasha Singer of the New York Times writes, Only one-fourth of teenagers in households with less than $35,000 in annual income said they had their own laptops compared with 62 percent in households with annual incomes of $100,000 or more, according to the report. Try typing a homework essay on your smartphone, for one reason why this matters.


Micah Lakin Avni, whose father Richard Lakin was stabbed to death by Palestinian attackers in Jerusalem three weeks ago, calls on Facebook and other social network platforms to do a more pro-active job of removing blatant incitement from their sites before waiting for complaints to arise.


If you are wondering why Twitters decision to replace the favorite star with a like heart has created such tumult in the Twittersphere, read this august piece by technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci about the problems with Facebooks like button. As she writes, Not everything in life is like-able. We cannot like refugee kids wading among dead bodies. And we cannot directly tell Facebooks algorithm that we still care about this, or find it important.


Tech and campaigns: Civic engagement start-up Brigade tested an interactive ballot guide for voters in the Bay Area and Manchester, New Hampshire, yesterday, and as Dawn Chmielewski reports for Re/Code, the companys engineers are hoping to learn if that made its users more likely to pledge support for candidates or recruit friends as a result.


ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising hub, gets a glowing profile in the New York Times from Eric Lichtblau and Nick Corasaniti.


Chris Gates of the Sunlight Foundation offers a useful list of questions for the 2016 presidential candidates, all pertaining to measuring their commitment to a more open and data-driven government.


Today in snake oil sales: Apparently polling and data science isnt enough for some political consultants; now theyre selling neuropolitics, reports Kevin Randall for the New York Times. As he reports, According to campaign records, the campaigns of presidents and prime ministers on at least three continents have hired science consultants to scan voters brains, bodies, and faces, all with the aim of heightening their emotional resonance with the electorate.


Take note: Our friends up the block at the Data & Society Institute are looking for their next group of fellows, for the 2016-17 cycle. Apply herethe deadline is December 1.

John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debate in 1960.


Editors note: Were pleased to welcome Christine Cupaiuolo, our new Civic Engagement Fellow, who will be leading the Rethinking Debates project. Over the next 12 months, she will report on how political debates around the world are using innovative formats and social media, focusing on examples that help make these crucial public events more informative, engaging, and responsive to the concerns of voters. This work is made possible with the vital support of the Democracy Fund.
The first Democratic presidential primary debate of 2016 drew a record 15.3 million viewers, smashing the previous record for a Democratic debate by almost 5 million. Nearly 24 million viewers tuned into the first Republican debate, making it the most-watched cable news program of all time.
The most recent GOP debate was a ratings hit for CNBC, but the campaigns were not so thrilled. Some of the Republican candidates are now insisting on more control over everything from who asks the questions and allotted response times, to the camera angles and room temperature
While the ratings and the obsession over details could be read as signs of a boom in civic engagement, or at least interest in robust political discussion, they most likely indicate the opposite. Politics, and political debates, are, more than ever, entertainment: a set of characters and events we watch in anticipation of the next gaffe or shift in narrative.
Yet for those of us interested in increasing genuine political participation and improving tone and substance, the days are not as dark as the latest debate meme might make it seem.
In fact, while technology can devalue political discourse (the very first televised debate famously proved that image has a tendency toexcuse the puntrump substance), technological innovations, especially in recent years, have been reinvigorating political discussions throughout the world, making it possible to envision debates as dynamic venues for a renewed, democratic approach to politics.
Still, the question remains: How do we figure out what works?
The Rethinking Debates project is taking on this question by exploring global examples of innovative political designs. As the new Civic Engagement Fellow at Civic Hall, Im excited to be leading this research effort.
Ill report on interactive debate formats, tools and platforms around the worldfrom France, where presidential candidates were asked to respond to real-time comments by Facebook users, to Argentina, which recently held its first-ever televised presidential debate, and even on developing countries such as Malawi, to evaluate the impact of the initial adoption of technology on the electoral process. Well also look at experiments in the UK, Germany, Japan, and New Zealand, as well as many other countries, as we put together more than a dozen case studies.
The project will explore how voters are driving the conversation on social media and investigate the extent to which communication markers, such as trending topics and hashtags, signify true engagement. The bulk of my research will be presented here, at Civicist, and compiled for a report that will be released in early spring.
Even before some Republican candidates called for doing away with journalists as debate moderators, public opinion in favor of voters asking questions has been growing. Im interested in identifying the most effective tools for expanding access by considering whether interactive technologies can meaningfully engage voters and perhaps even increase voter turnout. Can they make debates more responsive and accountable to voters interests and concerns? And what about potential downsides? For instance, can real-time viewer reaction metersthe worms that squiggle across the screen manipulate public opinion? Are certain technologies causing candidates to further simplify their message to match popular keywords?
Ive spent a good part of my career finding ways to use digital media to amplify the voices and ideas of people outside the conventional political process. After starting off as a beat reporter covering government and courts, I worked as a researcher for C-SPANs Brian Lamb, helping to retrace the steps of Alexis de Toquevilles 1831 journey that would become the basis of Democracy in America.
I later founded PopPolitics.com, an early online magazine committed to elevating the cultural conversation around the intersections of politics and pop culture. I developed one of the first feminist media blogs, Ms. Musings, for Ms. magazine, and later brought another iconic feminist publication, Our Bodies Ourselves, fully into the digital age, expanding access and representation of voices in the text. Ive also covered technology and education for the MacArthur Foundations Digital Media and Learning Initiative, writing about the opportunities digital media fosters and the dividesinfluenced by race, gender and classthat persist in this realm.
Ive taken short breaks in my career to work directly on two political campaignsfirst for one my political science professors who ran (unsuccessfully) for Congress in New York, and later to organize GOTV efforts in parts of Lee County, Fla., during President Obamas first presidential race. The Rethinking Debates project, however, is a completely nonpartisan effort. In fact, Civic Hall has enlisted an advisory board of experts, including people from both sides of the political aisle, who will assist with this research.
For too long, political debates have been a primary example of the ways in which substantive issues and the concerns of large segments of the public go unexplored. Im excited about reimagining this part of the political process and welcome your suggestions and feedback along the way. You can reach me at christine [at] civichall.org or @cmc2.

Todays unfortunately necessary civic tech must-read: Our good friend Deanna Zandt has written a detailed primer on Medium on what to do if you are getting harassed online. Complete with easy instructions on how to use BlockTogether.com, how to protect yourself on Facebook and Instagram, and how to deal with being doxxed.


Breaking: Longtime digital rights activist and New America fellow Rebecca MacKinnon is launching the Ranking Digital Rights project this morning at 10am ET with an event at Civic Hall (that Im moderating) which you can watch live. Writing for The Guardian, Sam Thielman previews the report, which scrutinizes the practices of eight top internet companies and eight top telecommunications companies. If this was a test, nearly everyone failed, MacKinnon says. No company clearly explains whether users can control what the company itself collects and shares about users, the reports executive summary notes. Furthermore, half of the companies do not explain whether users can access the information the company holds on them, and seven companies do not provide detail on how long they hold user information.


Endgame: Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig has suspended his quixotic bid for the White House, blaming an arbitrary rules change by the Democratic National Committee that now requires candidates to be at least at one percent in at least three national polls six weeks prior to the next debate. Lessig blogs, I was eager and happy to ask for support for the campaign when there was a prospect of getting into the debates. When there wasnt, I couldnt in good faith make that ask. When thats true, a campaign must end.  No word on whether his campaign has any money left to refund to its donors.


On the more hopeful side: Seattle is voting today on Initiative 122, known as the Honest Elections initiative, which would tighten campaign finance and lobbying rules and also set up a new system of democracy vouchers giving local citizens the ability to direct up to $100 in public funds to candidates of their choosing, Jack Horowiz reports for Mic.com. If enacted, the system would incentivize candidates to spend more time wooing ordinary voters, even poor ones.


Related: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, author of the Citizens United decision that let corporations spend unlimited amounts on elections, now admits that his expectation that internet-powered disclosure would deter corruption is not working the way it should, the Huffington Posts Paul Blumenthal reports. As Blumenthal archly noted, Kennedy should have known that his imagined disclosure regime was not working before the decision, either.


New on Civicist: Our Jessica McKenzie reports on Maplights plans to expand its Voters Edge voter guide from California to New York and Illinois in 2016.


No more open-washing? Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, writes that the Open Government Partnershipa signature initiative of the Obama Administrationshould make press freedom a sine qua non for participation, not an aspirational goal. Amen to that.

Votebnb: The sharing economy is on the ballot tomorrow in San Francisco, where Proposition F, which would limit short-term home rentals, is pitting Airbnb against the San Francisco tenants union, Conor Dougherty reports for the New York Times. He notes that several other ballot propositions are either directly or indirectly related to the technology industry and housing costs. In addition to the Airbnb thing, there are two affordable-housing measures and a proposal to help old-line businesses make rent in neighborhoods that are filling up with boutiques and organic restaurants.


Related: Nancy Watzman of the Internet Archive reports that, as that San Francisco vote nears, ads opposing Prop F are running at a rate of 100-1 compared to ads supporting the measure. Audio fingerprinting of YouTube-hosted advertising was used to identify the same ads in local station programming and cable news networks available in the region, from August 25 through October 26, she writes.


Unmasking: After months of relative quiet, the hacker network Anonymous is resurfacing this week with Operation KKK. Timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the Ferguson protests, the group has started posting personal contact information of people it alleges are KKK members, reports Anthony Cuthbertson of the International Business Times. The group claims Senators Tom Tillis (R-NC), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Dan Coats (R-IN) are Klan members, along with several mayors.


Hard not to quote this headline from The Register: Anonymous hack group plans to out anonymous hate group. With the 5th of November around the corner, Anonymous is also promising a Million Mask March in hundreds of cities worldwide this Thursday.


Following the money: Alessandra Stanley packed a lot of truth into this essay on Silicon Valleys New Philanthropy in Sundays New York Times. Most telling: for all his talk of disruption, the head of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Emmett Carson, which sits on nearly $5 billion from tech donors, has this to say about the Ford Foundations new focus on fighting income inequality: West Coast philanthropy is not influenced by East Coast pronouncements, he sniffed.

This is civic tech: The big news from SeeClickFix founder Ben Berkowitz is that starting in 2016, the city-centric problem-solving platform will making it easy for users to communicate laterally with each other. This will make it possible for neighbors to network with neighbors around common concerns, and government officials to connect directly with each other. Either way, its an important qualitative improvement in SCFs platform, which just tallied its two-millionth user report.

The nonpartisan money-and-politics watchdog MapLight is expanding their deep-dive voter guide, Voters Edge, to New York and Illinois next year. Voters Edge was created to put good civic info in front of voters, says MapLight president and co-founder Daniel Newman, and the best way MapLight has determined they can do that is to provide detailed candidate information all the way down to the local level, even if that limits the geographic areas they can cover.
At a brown bag lunch at Civic Hall last month, Newman explained that Voters Edge was originally conceived as an antidote to negative advertising.
An informed electorate is essential to a functioning democracy, Newman added.
Voters Edge was first launched in California in 2010 to explain several ballot propositionsincluding one that wanted to suspend a landmark environmental lawand expanded nationally in 2014. It let voters in all 50 states know who was on their statewide ballot, and included some supplemental information like biographical information, and funding sources. Voters could fill out the ballot the way they would at the voting booth and, if they wanted, share it on social media.
But, with the exception of California, Newman admits, the information available on Voters Edge was pretty thin. They didnt have the capacity to drill down to the local level in all 50 states.
Californias Voters Edge, howeverthe result of a partnership between MapLight and the League of Women Voters of Californiaincluded detailed candidate information, like endorsements, all the way down to the local level. It also provided information about ballot measures, including money spent in support and in opposition, and links to editorials and news articles written about them.
Screenshot of the funding page for this 2014 candidate for Californias Attorney General.
MapLight recorded 728,000 unique visitors to the California site, the rough equivalent of one in 10 California voters, based on the 2014 turnout of 7.4 million.
Newman told the group gathered at Civic Hall that local information gave the most value because the local level is where voters have the least amount of information. For this reason, MapLight has decided to only focus their efforts this election season in states where they can go down to that level: California, Illinois, and New York.
All three sites will be up and ready to go in the spring for primary elections. The Voters Edge research team will be collecting the data in Illinois and New York but they are looking for organizational partners that might be able to assist. They are also interested in partnering with media organizations.

This piece was first posted on the SeeClickFix blog.
Yesterday, the two millionth issue was submitted via SeeClickFix. This is an important moment for us and a chance to reflect on how SeeClickFix has evolved over the years and where we are headed next.
Heres the two millionth issue!

The purpose of SeeClickFix has always been to improve communities by getting neighborhood issues resolved. This has driven every decision that we have made over the past six years. In other words, these 2 million issues are the reason we exist. Each issue represents a moment of successful communicationa step toward making a town a better place to live. Each issue represents incremental progress in building trusting and supportive communities for citizens and governments.
Today, Id like to offer a brief depiction of where this journey has led us and how, after 2 million issues, our purpose has evolved.
Id also like to use this moment to announce what we are working on next: a brand new way to connect directly with neighbors and governments on SeeClickFix. We will be rolling out direct mentions on SeeClickFix this year and we want to give you early access.
But first, heres a story.
Increasing Accessibility
Eight years ago, SeeClickFix was born out of frustration. I had tried, unsuccessfully to get a piece of graffiti removed from a building next door to where I was living in New Haven. The process was unnecessarily complex and I had trouble making my concerns visible to the folks that mattered. I knew there had to be a better way, so I convinced that smartest people I knewKam and Miles Lasaterto work nights and weekends with me, building a tool that would make our concerns more visible to our city.
What we built was an online forum where neighbors could publicly document concerns with information like photos, addresses, and descriptions. Because these concerns were public, our neighbors could congregate and collaboratediscussing and identifying solutions to these issues. Importantly, we also built a notification tool that allowed users to forward their concerns directly to public officials.
There were two things that surprised us immediately. First, the support from my community was amazing. I could never have predicted the level of participation and excitement from my neighbors. Secondand perhaps most importantlythe issues that were reported were actually getting fixed, and they were getting fixed fast. Direct access to city officials along with increased public accountability appeared to be a powerful combination. This open dialog began to slowly transform the city.
As neighborhood activity grew, cities began coming to us, asking for more. Officials wanted us to improve both the quantity and quality of these exchanges. To do this, we built an iPhone app and an embeddable reporting tool for city websites. We also built a backend tool that allowed officials to structure the information that came from the public with request types and secondary questions. Finally, we integrated into city work management systems, so that any concern coming into a city could be routed directly into the citys workflow.
These tools were a force multiplier for 311, and spread quickly throughout the countrys biggest cities. As Frank Carmody, assistant director of Houston 311 described:
SeeClickFix enables citizens to report problems without calling 311. A force multiplier for 311 because citizens can self-serve, which reduces calls to 311 and, therefore, lowers the Average Speed of Answer. Because of SeeClickFix, Houston 311 is now significantly more efficient.
Improving Communication
By 2012, our government partnerships had made SeeClickFix a leader in public communication: increasing government accessibility around the world. Working with civic innovators like Frank, we had built a highly efficient reporting system. And because these tools were built on the SeeClickFix public forum, we had also helped to strengthen neighborhood communication in hundreds of communities.
Cities like Houston have complex workflow and communication systems. SeeClickFix is able to connect directly to these systems, adding a citizen input channel to the citys internal workflow. For most cities however, these workflow systems are disparate and disconnectedoften they are almost non-existent. When a concern would come in via SeeClickFix, the city official would have to manually track this issue through multiple departments and systemscalling each department to check on progress and manually calling back each concerned citizen. This is a huge pain and requires a ton of resources to accomplish successfully. To address this complexity, SeeClickFix built workflow and analytics tools into our backend system. These tools gave government officials a central location where they could track citizen concerns and manage the public communication surrounding these concerns. Now, issues would not fall through the cracks, and management had tools to measure and report on successful exchanges.
The internal communication supporting the resolution of a single issue can be really complex. A graffiti issue, for example, may need to start within the Police Department, where it is inspected for potential legal action. The issue may then get sent over to Code Enforcement to facilitate resolution on a private property and then, finally, to Public Works who will paint over the graffiti. In each of these departments, the issues may touch the administrative assistant, the director, and the field staff. In some scenarios, part or all of this process may be handled by an external agency. Managing this internal communication along with the external communication with the public is a major obstacle for many towns.
Internal and external communication are both really hard. For most cities, doing both well is impossible. Thats why over the past few years, weve worked with our government partners to build a complete service management system that handles both the external and internal communication required to run successful public service organization. There is tremendous powerand efficiencyto managing external communication with the public in the same system where you manage the internal communication around the related work. In fact it is the only way that most small to medium-sized cities can provide a high level of service.
In order to build this integrated system, we had to redesign the communication model that we designed back in 2009. We added internal and private communication tools that work in line with both work order processing and public notifications. We rebuilt our government interface from the ground up to provide a streamlined communication process that works across departments and across devices.
Today, two million issues have been routed via SeeClickFix. Each of these issues represents a concerned citizen and an opportunity to change a persons relationship with their local government. And now, it also represents a chance for internal communication and relationships between departments and within a local government to build and improve.
Connecting Directly
To date, communication on SeeClickFix has been entirely one to many.
Its often the case, however, that our neighborhood and government users need to communicate directly with one another. Here are a couple examples:


Neighbors need to connect directly with other neighbors to organize events and discuss projects. For example, neighbors who have connected to clean graffiti in a shared space may want to organize directly on further projects.




Government officials want to connect directly with other officials to update information or ask a question regarding an outstanding ticket.


Before today, none of this is possible.
Today, we are announcing one to one communication on SeeClickFix. This will allow all of the above examples and many more to be possible on the SeeClickFix platform. With one to one communication, neighborhood users can connect directly with other neighborhood users and government officials can directly connect with other officials around the issues, ideas, and projects that they care about the most.
To accomplish this, we will be adding unique handles for all SeeClickFix users that will be used both for public references as well as direct communication.
Of course, these tools will also come with enhanced notifications and privacy settings.
One to one communication will be rolling out in 2016. But you can get started today by signing up for early access to claim your handle. Im going with @bb.
Final Thoughts
To our citizen and government users, thank you so much for your continued support throughout the years. We are continually inspired by your commitment to improving the public space.
And thank you for these 2 million submissionsas I said at the beginning, these are the 2 million reasons why we exist. They are 2 million reminders of our purpose; and 2 million ways youve helped us evolve.
Your passion is the reason for everything we do. We cant wait to see what you will do with one to one communication.
@benberkowitz

Ben Berkowitz is the founder and CEO of SeeClickFix. A proud resident of New Haven, CT, the inspiration for SeeClickFix came from a desire to improve his own community with his neighbors and his government.

Civic EngagementCivic Tech 





mySocietys research director Rebecca Rumbul has released an important new study, Who benefits from civic technology? Its the first fruit of mySocietys big new thrust into user and impact research on civic tech. The report looks at variations in usage of civic techdefined as technologies that enable citizens to hold governments to accountin the U.S., U.K., Kenya, and South Africa, and examines the attitudes of users towards the platforms they are using. A total of 3,705 online survey responses were collected. The sites were FixMyStreet and TheyWorkForYou in the U.K., GovTrack and SeeClickFix in the U.S., Mzalendo in Kenya and Peoples Assembly in South Africa. (Other country sites were also in the study but did not generate enough user responses to be statistically useful.)


The report found that in the U.K. and the U.S., the vast majority of users of these sites (FixMyStreet and GovTrack, specifically) are older, with roughly half over the age of 55. The opposite is true in Kenya and South Africa. Men account for 2/3 or more of the users except in the U.S. case, where the gender breakdown was even. In the U.K. and South Africa, whites use these sites disproportionately more than their share of the population (that question was not included by the sites in the U.S. and Kenya). Across the board, these civic tech sites attract users who are not surprisingly highly political engaged and better educated than the general population.


Heres one of Rumbuls key normative findings: [the] data tells us that in the U.K. and U.S., civic technology users at least in some ways resemble the existing dominant class, and that this class has recognized the potential of civic technology to facilitate and amplify effective civic interaction, whether that be in tracking political information on welfare, researching legislative progress for professional purposes or maintaining the local community environment. This has significant implications for civic technology implementers. Many groups conceive of civic technology as a tool for effective and accessible democratic action. The digital environment is thought to reduce traditional barriers to engagement and access experienced by the less engaged groups within society. If, however, digital democracy tools are predominantly being used by a homogeneous group already dominant in society, this has the potential to skew policy and practical interventions in favor of this dominant group, at the same time compounding disadvantage amongst less dominant groups in society.


This is a very important and sobering conclusion. But we should be careful not to over-interpret this finding. mySocietys study did not look directly at economic class, so its possible that these civic tech platforms are actually helping empower some people who otherwise wouldnt be in the position to pay to play in the political arena the way the top one percent do. It also looked at a narrow band of civic tech platforms: the generic parliamentary transparency sites (GovTrack and TheyWorkForYou) and two community problem-solving platforms (FixMyStreet and SeeClickFix). Notably, it doesnt provide any user data from the SeeClickFix sample (by the way, the company hit its two-millionth report yesterday and is today launching some impressive new neighbor engagement features). It would be edifying to spread the net wider to include platforms like Vermonts Front Porch Forum and Minneapolis e-democracy, as well the growing array of mobile-centric civic engagement platforms. Finally, civic tech is a bigger field than just government accountability tools. Defining it that narrowly leaves out vital projects like Democracy Works, which focus on helping people register and vote; or the Smart Chicago Collaborative, which makes tools with its urban and working-class community, or whole urban ecosystems like what is happening in Detroit. As Microsofts CivicGraph shows, the civic tech ecosystem is much bigger than just the sites mySociety surveyed. So while the issues Rumbul raises are real, more research is needed before saying this is the whole story.


Mark Headd chews on the mySociety survey and takes heart that it shows that many users of these sites believe that they are useful, and that using them makes them more confident to engage public officials. But he also notes that if public officials arent more responsive as a result, the promise of accountability offered by these sites could lead to disillusionment.

Fracking in process (Joshua Doubek, CC BY-SA 3.0)

About six years ago, Shane Davis quit his job as a biologist to spend all of his time aggregating and analyzing data about oil and gas.
Davis says he gives citizens the tools to fight off the oil and gas industry. With information he provides, Davis says communities can go to companies and tell them:
Wait a minute. We have information here showing that over the last X amount of years your operations have already caused groundwater contamination at this rate or your patterns of spills are at this rate. Or this many people got hurt. Or there are complaints, laundry lists of complaints about your operation. Or maybe these operators have had huge problems with their well casings. Maybe theyve contaminated private water wells or an aquifer.

In other words, Davis is stepping in where he says state regulatory agencies have failed to protect the people, earth, and water of Colorado from pollution. Indeed, all over the U.S. and world, environmentalists have stopped relying on government agencies to monitor everything from oil spills to the spread of invasive species. Instead, calling themselves citizen scientists, theyre taking matters into their own computers and smartphones: gathering, analyzing, and publishing data. Some, like Davis, have adopted a combative stance toward the government. Many others would rather work with government agencies and say theyre contributing information the state simply doesnt have the capacity to gather.
Davis gets his information from a state agency, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, or COGCC. When companies send mandatory reports about their operations to the state, the COGCC uploads them to their website as PDFs. Since PDFs are nearly impossible to aggregate and analyze, Davis developed tools to scrape information from them and dump it into an Excel spreadsheeta really, really topnotch spreadsheet, a spreadsheet that has incredible functionality, he says. Then, he looks for patterns: spills, groundwater contamination, well casing failures.
At first, Davis spent 70 to 80 hours a week doing this work. I was basically in my own solitary confinement for two years, he recalls. Now, its gotten a lot easier. Im pretty quick at it.
When Davis finds useful information, he brings it to communities and shares it.
My presentations are not data-heavy. Youre going to lose everyone if you just jam it packed full of data, he explains. Ill put in images, satellite images of the shale formation, and Ill pick a bunch of peoplepoliticians or environmental whatever. And Ill show where they live, right on top of that shale formation. But then Ill show them all the other well bores that are around their house and some failures that have happened. Maybe theres a benzene spill.
Davis is not the only citizen scientist to adopt this tactic: to take advantage of the troves of data available on government websites to tell stories. Adrian Cotter, whos been with the Sierra Club for 13 years, says environmentalists have always considered themselves data-based and the only difference is the accessibility of data: Theres just a lot of resources online for finding everything from all the oil rigs in Alaska to all the [oil] leases in the Gulf. Overlaying that data with maps, as Cotter did with oil rigs and the migratory paths of the caribou herds of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, can tell powerful stories.
In 2012 and 2013, six Colorado communities voted on bans or moratoriums on fracking within their borders. Davis visited all of them, bearing information about the oil and gas industry. He recalls telling them, Hey, look whats happening in your backyard! Near your schools, your playgrounds, your universities, public parks. This is the information that I can give you. In its turn, the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, the industry trade association, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting the measures. Its unclear to what extent Davis data managed to sway voters, but hes been credited with inciting anti-fracking sentiment in Colorado and with coining the term fractivist. Five of the measures passed, one of them by only 13 votes.
Since then, the Colorado Oil and Gas Association has sued all five communities, saying only the state has the power to regulate the industry. The state has joined the industry in the suits, which Davis views as yet more evidence that regulatory agencies are designed by those they benefit the most and are not capable of protecting the citizenry. Courts struck down three of the fracking bans, and the Colorado Supreme Court is considering the other two.
Some citizen scientists find it more efficacious to work with government agencies rather than fighting them. David Newell, a professor at Southern Cross University, in New South Wales, Australia, and a researcher of frogs and toads, says, We need to work collaboratively to be able to bring about change.
For example, he wanted to find out how far the invasive cane toad had spread across his state of New South Wales. It would have been expensive to launch a studyand, besides, people already had the information; there just wasnt an easy way for them to share it.
Well, they can ring up their local park service office and somebody would write it down on a piece of paper and if were lucky it might end up in a database, he says he thought at the time. But lets actually come up with a mechanism by which people can use technology, log their record, and also at the same time gain additional information around what it is that they can actually doso give them a portal to be able to contribute to the database and then get additional information.
Thats why Newell decided to build Toad Tracker, which has since become Toad Scan, a means for average Australians to report cane toad sightings. Toad Scan is the opposite of a PDF: Instead of uploading information in such a way that anyone interested in the data has to wade through reams of documents in order to find anything useful, all the data is right there, instantaneously available to the public.
Screenshot of damage reported on Toad Scan
That democratization of information at first made government regulators uncomfortable, Newell recalls, because they see themselves as the knowledge-holders of databases. That said, he adds, once government agencies see that this is a really valuable tool to be able to capture spatial information, they generally come around. His goal is for citizens, academics, and the public to work together towards conservation goals.
As for Shane Davis in Colorado, hell continue to fight. Im not stopping until we change law so it favors communities and the environment and does not favor corporations, corporate capitalism, oil and gas, he says.

This is civic tech: The annual NYC Big Apps competition just announced the 2015 semifinalists, in the categories of affordable housing, zero waste, connected cities and citizen engagement. Congrats to several Civic Hall members Melanie Lavelle of the Benefit Kitchen team, Maria Yuan of Issue Voter, and Sanjaya Punyasena of Simpolfy.


The Knight Foundation is giving $648,000 to MITs Laboratory for Social Machines for a new campaign analytics project called The Electome. Research scientist William Powers explains the projects goals: to move beyond the politicians and medias fixation on the horse race, and to listen more closely to citizen voices and see if candidates and journalists are responding to those concerns. Twitter has given the lab (which it funds) a gift for this project, toothe full firehouse of 500 million new tweets written each day. The project also plans to use data fro Facebook, Reddit and Google searches, and the Washington Post and Mashable will be working directly with it as well.


The Electome could be a transformative project, as a Knight press release outlines: In development since last spring, the Electome is designed to create real-time, comprehensive map tracking election-related content and show the connections between three main information sources: the media and journalists, messaging from the candidates, and public conversations on social media. It will look to use computer science tools, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to trace the elections narratives as they form, spread, morph and decline  identifying who and what influences these dynamics and outcomes.


Two questions from this corner: Will the Electomes algorithms be open for inspection by others? And will its editorial decisions be open? Lets hope so. Ill let you know what I find out.


Democratic presidential candidate Martin OMalley is taking his civic tech pitch competition to Bostons District Hall next Wednesday, Jon Chesto reports for the Boston Globe.


Luke Fretwell, the founder of the civic tech blog GovFresh, offers some useful suggestions on how to improve a set of proposals made by the states Little Hoover Commission. The bipartisan commission, which is tasked with government oversight, is calling on the governor and legislature to create a new post of chief customer officer along with an internal digital services team. It also wants the state government to focus on open data and human-centered design. 


The web we want? Writing for Fortune magazine, Mathew Ingram explains how Facebooks Instant Articles and Twitters new Moments feature are jointly killing the web link, and ponders whether that is bad thing. Heres one reason why it is, as he writes: because Facebook controls the algorithm that determines what users see or dont see, then it gets to decide what the news is, and what is important. And thats a potential problem if Facebook chooses to delete disturbing images or news stories about war and promote peaceful happy stories instead. In some cases, information disappears from Facebook and the social network never explains why.


Seventy-two feminist and civil rights organizations have asked the US Department of Education to issue guidelines to colleges that would urge them to ban Yik Yak and other anonymous social media apps in the interest of stopping the harassment of marginalized students, Amanda Hess reports for Slate. She argues that this is a dumb idea, and points out that while Yik Yak has been used on campuses by racists and homophobes to target students, it has also been used to quickly rally visible support for suicidal students and victims of homophobia. She also notes that no social network has been more aggressive about stemming harassment and encouraging community than Yik Yak has.

Government openings: As the Open Government Partnerships annual summit starts in Mexico City, Martin Tisne, the Omidyar Networks director of policy for its government transparency initiative, argues that its not enough for governments to promise to be more open with their data: Do we change the course of history with the mere existence of more data or because people access it, mobilize, and press for change?


Related: In tandem with the summit, the White House released its third Open Government National Action Plan, which it says both broadens and deepens efforts to help government become more open and more citizen-centered.


A We the People petition on the White House website demanding that President Obama publicly affirm his support for strong encryption has received more than 100,000 signatures, which means it is due an official response, Jenna McLaughlin reports for The Intercept.


Conference call: With BuzzFeed and Vox Media both threatening to withdraw from SXSW Interactive unless two controversial panels are reinstated, the festivals organizers are now considering an all-day event focused on combatting online harassment, Re/Codes Noah Kulwin reports.

Life in Facebookistan: Facebook is giving its employees the opportunity to experience what using the companys mobile app feels like to someone with a slow connection typical to the emerging markets the company is trying to conquer, Jillian DOnfrio reports for Business Insider. The initiative, which is called 2G Tuesdays and is supposed to help close the empathy gap' between Silicon Valley and emerging markets, works like this: When a Facebook employee logs in to the app any Tuesday morning, theyll see a prompt at the top of their News Feed asking whether they want to try out the slower connection for an hour.

Todays civic tech must-read: Rachel Cohen, a writing fellow at the American Prospect, argues in Pushing civic tech beyond its comfort zone (a feature article in its Fall 2015 print issue) that technologists who talk about revolutionizing local government by improving its IT, making it more responsive, transparent, data-driven and cost-effective are set[ting] up people for later disappointment. She writes, Accountability, however, is ultimately a political matter, and civic tech cannot simply steer clear of politics in the belief that technology will solve problems on its own. Among the civic tech leaders cited in her piece: Ben Berkowitz of SeeClickFix, Stephen Goldsmith and Susan Crawford (co-authors of The Responsive City: Engaging Communities Through Data-Smart Governance), Sean Moulton of the Project on Government Oversight, Tiago Peixoto of the World Bank, Dan ONeil of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, Haley Van Dyck of the U.S. Digital Service, Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics and Eric Liu of Citizen University. Oh, and some dude named Sifry and some conference called Personal Democracy Forum.


Just launched by Political Animal and Poderopedia: NarcoData, a digital platform tracking 40 years of Mexicos drug cartels, including their emergence, geographic expansion, international relationships and criminal activities.


Embattled Empaneled: Hugh Forrest, the longtime organizer of SXSW Interactive, has announced that two previously announced sessions related to online harassment and gaming cultureone that was seen as pro-GamerGate and one that was nothave been canceled due to numerous threats of on-site violence related to this programming. (GamerGate refers to a loose-knit online network that has viciously targeted women in the gaming industry.) Forrests statement noted that SXSWs big tent of ideas requires civil and respectful dialogue and that if a safe and secure place that is free of online and offline harassment cannot be assured, the sanctity of that big tent would be compromised. Not explained by his statement: why the conference organizers couldnt assure sufficient on-site security for these two panels to take place.


Level Up: Overcoming Harassment in Games, was the non-GamerGate panel canceled by SXSW. On Twitter, one of its organizers, Randi Harper of the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, shared a stream of protests about the decision, noting that we didnt demand that the GamerGate panel be removed from the schedule. We just asked that safety precautions be taken. She also noted, Our panel was not about GamerGate, but instead making design decisions in abuse systems.


Another co-panelist, Katherine Cross of CUNY Graduate Center, said, The panel was meant to be a wide-ranging discussion about how we might design websites, social media, and online games to be less susceptible to online harassment and hate mobbing. We were going to discuss various design proposals, including some already extant in the gaming industry that have been proven to work, but our panel was meant to be a solutions-oriented discussion of harassment in general. She also told Austin Walker of Giant Bomb News that SXSW had not alerted her panel about threats of violence before announcing their panels cancellation.


The other canceled panel, SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community, featured several supporters of the GamerGate movement. Perry Jones of the Open Gaming Society says the group is raising money to hold its panel during SXSW somewhere nearby.


As Noah Kulwin writes for Re/Code, SXSWs decision shows that The online hate mob of Gamergate is good at two things: Sending horrible threats to women online, and forcing people to shut down events featuring people critical of Gamergate.


Digital politics: The White House is disagreeing with FBI Directer James Comeys recent claims that increased scrutiny of local police behavior and fear of officers that their actions will go viralthe so-called YouTube effectis leading to a rise in violent crime in some cities, Michael Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo report for the New York Times. The evidence we have seen so far doesnt support the contention that law enforcement officials are shirking their responsibilities, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in response to a question about Comeys remarks.


A new study from the Brennan Center for Justice, Voter Registration in a Digital Age: 2015 Update looks at the 38 states that now offer electronic and/or online registration and finds that it is boosting registration rates, increasing voter roll accuracy, and saving money.


With the help of his newly installed senior enforcement counsel Tim Wu, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has told Verizon, Time Warner, and Cablevision that he is probing whether their so-called super-fast premium internet connections are actually ripping off customers with slower-than-advertised speeds, Christie Smythe reports for Bloomberg Business.


The news from Facebookistan: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is continuing his charm offensive in China, giving a speech in Mandarin while on a visit to Tsinghua University in Beijing (where he is on the board of its school of economics and management), the Los Angeles Times reports.


Meanwhile, as Vindu Goel reports for the New York Times, Facebooks Internet.org project (which was recently renamed Free Basics) is struggling to gain acceptance in India. As Goel notes, one of Facebooks local telco partners, Reliance, is known for shoddy service. And as he writes, one phone shop owner told him, Even if Reliances network were good...the package excludes WhatsApp, a popular messaging app owned by Facebook, and users must pay to see the photos in their Facebook feeds. If you have to pay for data, whats the point of calling it free? he said.


Your moment of zen: Former President Bill Clinton tells Mark Halperin of Bloomberg Politics that he likes the selfie phenomenon. In a way I like it, though, because its democratized record-keeping of memoriesbecause if you can afford a cell phone, youve got a camera, and a camera will operate at a fairly high resolution, with a fairly good amount of clarity, and if you need to for some reason you can print it out. He also joked that if selfies existed back in the 1980s when he first entered politics in Arkansas, he might not have lived to run for President. I did not have a selfie with that woman. No, he didnt say that.

Tech and the presidentials: When GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker dropped out of the race, none of the other Republican campaigns sought to pick up his digital team, and as Issie Lapowsky reports for Wired, this may be the latest evidence that conservatives are still lagging behind liberals in how much they prioritize tech for their campaigns.


Surging Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson is heavily reliant on Facebook, where he has 4.3 million fans, David Drucker reports for the Washington Examiner. Carson personally takes and answers three questions every night on his Facebook page; the interaction generates an average of 100,000 responses that are shared approximately 10,000 times.


Doug Watts, Carsons chief communications counselor, tells Drucker: ...we all came in sharing the ethic of having a social media-orientedcentriccampaign, because we were all totally taken with [President] Obamas campaign in 2007 and 2008, and of course no Republican has even come close to exercising that kind of a program. And we thought you could.

There are #firstworldproblems, and there are #thirdworldproblems. When it comes to communications technologies and phones, there are the problems of being a human being in the 21st century. Recent articles about the role of mobile phones for migrant and refugee communities have unleashed a torrent of tweets and articles: If they are so in need for help, why do refugees have phones? How can they possibly be that desperate if they can afford a data plan?
I used to joke about #firstworldproblems myself, but after seeing misunderstandings like these, I stopped.
To be fair, these are good questions if your image of technology is that of luxury and distraction, and if your image of refugees is stuck in 20th century imagery of destitution. But travel the world over, and the role of mobile phones is clear: They are as essential as clothes, money, food and water. They help people stay in touch for business and family reasons. They have maps. They can help people take notes and share those notes across long distances. They have music. They are more affordable than clean, running water and more portable than a suitcase. In a mud hut in East Africa, a crowded bus in Southeast Asia, by the river in rural China, phones and their capabilities can improve the lives of many, both for utilitarian and emotional purposes. They are the Swiss Army Knives of the 21st century.
This misunderstanding is unfortunate but not uncommon when it comes to narratives about the global south. When President Obama boarded a plane for a state visit to Kenya, CNN described the country as a hotbed of terror. This was not the first time broadcast media made a sweeping generalization about the country, and Kenyans on Twitter quickly revived the hashtag #SomeoneTellCNN to draw attention to the absurdity. In previous years, such as during the 2013 elections, hashtags such as this one and #TweetLikeAForeignJournalist drew attention to outdated generalizations about life in the country. This past year, the hashtag jokes even prompted a visit from CNNs managing editor, who publicly apologized for the mis-characterization.
A similar flurry of misguided articles erupted recently around Taylor Swifts concert tour in China. A rumor emerged that Swifts t-shirt line, bearing the phrase T.S. 1989, would be repurposed as a thinly veiled reference to the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. Article after article in English-speaking press suggested there would be heavy censorship of the shirts online and that the tour itself might even be canceled. Nothing of the sort was happening inside the country. Writing in Vox, Max Fisher identified the source of the confusion: its hard to see past the story of censorship in China and imagine the daily lives of young people living under censorship and enjoying pop music from around the world.
I think of the examples above as symptomatic of a larger problem: we have what author Claire Light has called a failure of our global imagination. And by we, I mean those of us living and working in privileged Western contexts, far removed from the daily lives of those living in places of war, censorship, and rapid industrialization. We can imagine the general experiences and emotions that these words evokefear, doubt, uncertainty, excitementbut we cannot imagine the ins and outs, the everydays, the way people live under circumstances very different from our own.
This failure can have devastating consequences. Empathy is founded in our ability to see ourselves in the lives of others, to understand their pain and suffering and respond with compassion. If we cannot imagine the lives of others very different from ourselves, we cannot empathize with their joys and sorrows, and if we take as a frame of reference our own experiences, we cannot deeply engage with others lived experiences. If we assume that phones are frivolous, luxury devices for playing games and getting distracted at the dinner table, we cannot imagine how critical they are for helping people find their way to nearby safe pointsand then we overlook the need to distribute prepaid SIM cards alongside water bottles. If we assume that transparency and openness are universal goods, we cannot imagine how that openness can be terrifying for a queer person trying to live safely and with dignity in a country with anti-LGBT legal structuresand then we enact Terms of Service and user experiences that promote the very thing (visibility) that can make their lives more dangerous.
The world has long been interconnected. If yesterdays globalization was one of mass production and distribution of objects and a one of political relations, the globalization of today is that of people to people. Thanks to increased mobility and, more broadly, global internet connectivity, we are more in touch with the images, words and narratives of people living in parts of the world we may have never heard of and heard from. A tweet in Spanish can spark surprise in the English-speaking world, and an image meme made on Chinas Sina Weibo can slowly wind its way over to Egyptian Facebook. A lot of people are finding voice, but its just as importantif not more sothat with this interconnectedness, those of us with greater privilege and access understand our own responsibility to listen and, where appropriate, amplify.
How can we change this? How can we transform our global imaginations to understand the rich diversity of human life and living in the 21st century? While travel outside major tourist zones can help, scaling that up for all people can be difficult, if not impossible. The tourist industry makes it easy for people with means to skip over to new cities, but it also cloaks the diversity of local life and living, something that takes time, language skills, and patience to understand and experience.
More importantly, for those of us who have the privilege of accessing diverse global experiences, we need to shift the narrative. And we need to listen and reflect the stories of others lives more effectively. Heres how I think we can do that.
Writers about tech need to nuance the narrative. New tech has different effects on different people, and not everyone is a middle class Westerner. Every time we trot out the tired argument that selfies are a form of narcissism, we limit our perspectives on the vast diversity of creative production enabled by new and networked technologies like smartphones. There is no doubt that some selfies for some people serve a narcissistic, self-aggrandizing purpose. But selfies can be a form of advocacy, of creating visibility for underrepresented people, of simply connecting with family and friends back home (sometimes home is thousands of miles away). It can seem puzzling to see refugees arriving on the coasts of Greece with selfie sticks, but what better way than a selfie to tell family and friends back home that youve made it back safely and in good spirits?
The broader dialogue in Western media and intellectual culture must stop critiquing technologys effects on society with a lens that seems to focus largely on middle class Americans and Western Europeans. Phones can certainly distract from in-person conversations, but they can also facilitate vital connections amongst a global diaspora. When we broadly apply critiques of technology to everywhere and every context, we overlook important discourses around justice, intent and power. We need to understand how technology is used in different cultures and for those with limited resources, and we need to remember positionality when it comes to how people use technology.
We need to tell the human stories of the next billion. Really tell them. Use photos. Use stories. Use videos. Its not enough to talk about the next billion in abstract, like an opportunity to reach teeming masses of people ripe for monetization. We need to understand their lives and their priorities with the sort of detail that can build empathy for other people living under vastly different circumstances. A common misperception Ive heard about refugees fleeing their country is that they probably wouldnt prioritize their phones. And yet, its almost certain that anyone in a natural disaster in San Francisco would grab their smartphones. How else will they call their families, access resources, alert the authorities?
Can we shift narratives about the developing world to talk about building agency through technology? To talk about connecting once-disconnected communities through technology? Can we move past the sweeping discussions of marketing and monetization opportunities for the next billion and learn more about what motivates them to use the internet and phones in the first place? Its one thing to share photos of a solar-powered cell phone in the Sahara; its quite another to tell the story of the music the phones owner listens to and how he uses the texting feature to stay in touch with family while he travels.
Its time to abandon the First World/Third World dichotomy. Whether or not this dichotomy was a helpful one at some point in the past, its no longer helpful now. The Third World has glittering skyscrapers and glowing smartphones, and the First World has decaying neighborhoods and entire swaths of the country without broadband. There are very real and important differences between rich and poor countries, and these dynamics play out at the level of international relations, all the way down to the mundane and often humiliating work of applying for visas. But this framing creates a divide that limits our capacity to understand the vast spectra of the way human beings live in the 21st century. I dont yet have a better vocabulary for this, but I hope someone smarter than me can figure that out. For now, I do use the phrases developing world, global south, and poor countries, but Id like to have a better framework. Any suggestions?
Remember the diversity of ways we use communications technology: that includes connecting with people we care about and depend on. In contrast to narratives about vanity, slacktivism, and luxury when it comes to tech in the middle-class West, so much of the conversation about technology in the global south focuses on information and practical communications, like around agricultural trends and educational material. This is good and important work. But highly pragmatic use cases are just part of the reason anyone has used communications technology. Informal markets from Asia to Africa are filled with music and movies, like a Bluetooth-powered Napster, and people are just as likely to send text messages and Facebook posts to check in with friends and loved ones as they are to access important healthcare information and market reports. These things can coexist.
Like a city, the internet and mobile phones provide for a vast diversity of human needs, which include the basic human need for companionship, support, and access to joy in the face of suffering. Fortunately, this part of the global imagination doesnt require too much effort: Just think of how everyone you know uses technology, the number of apps, the different ways they laugh, smile, cry, and scowl at what they see behind those plates of glass.
Shifting the narrative is such a critical part of the motivation behind my work with global internet cultures, and the above are just a few ideas for how I think we can do that. But more important than trying to know everything about the world is establishing a culture of knowing that we dont know. The assumption that we can parachute into a foreign culture with formal expertise and knowledge and make things better has never been acceptable, and it has led to a lot of unnecessary suffering, especially in colonized countries. The fact that people in marginalized parts of the world can now call out misguided attitudes and perceptions about them will go a long way, and those of us with access to media and policy can do well to amplify and extend these voices.
But it is also not possible to know every detail about other peoples lives. Attention is limited, as is time. We can learn everything we can about the day to day of rural Laos, but the conflict in Mali will seem completely opaque. Instead, its more important to know that we dont know, know that we need to listen to those who have greater familiarity, and to know that there are ways to go further. Adopting an attitude of humility and curiosity can take us much farther than an attitude of assuredness and assumption. This seems to me like a good place to startand if you have other and better ideas, Id love to hear them.

Perhaps no other process of government that has such a significant impact on peoples lives is as opaque and little understood as establishing the rules for land use.
Maybe the redistricting process. Maybe.
How land is zonedthe setting of specific requirements for how land may be used, and even how buildings and structures on land may be designedis a complex process because discretion for setting zoning rules is generally delegated to local governments. My home state of New York provides a very comprehensive (though somewhat dated) guide for local communities that want to institute zoning rules. Its a fascinating read.
Land use rules can fundamentally alter the character of communities, and there is an increasingly robust body of research that suggests that where you live  where you are born, grow up, access educational opportunities and job opportunitieshelps determine your lot in life. There is also an abundance of information available that details how land use rules have added to the very serious problem of segregation in many communities in this country.

In a time when our collective attention is focused on higher offices at the state and federal level, its easy to forget about local government officialsparticularly at the town and village leveland the work that they do. County legislatures, city councils, town councils and village boards all have a part to play in deciding how land gets used and, by extension, where people get to live.
By determining rules for lot size, housing density, and an array of other factors, local government officials and appointed zoning commissions impact the price for housing, and indirectly dictate who can afford to buy housing. This impacts peoples choice of neighborhood, the job opportunities available to them and where their children can go to school. For far too long, in far too many places, these decisions have helped to concentrate people of limited incomes in areas where job and educational opportunities are scare and where crime and other social ills are more common.
Two excellent recent studies help us understand the depth of this problem and lay out some policy options for starting to address them.
The Architecture of Segregation, an exhaustive study by Paul Jargowsky, details how over the last 15 years poverty has become concentrated in many urban areas in our country:
In the 1990s...the number of persons living in high-poverty neighborhoodsdefined as census tracts where the federal poverty rate was 40 percent or moredropped by 25 percent [from the 1960s], from 9.6 million to 7.2 million. Since 2000, however, that progress has been squandered as there has been a rapid re-concentration of poverty.

Jargowsky specifically points to exclusionary zoning rules adopted by local governments as one of the factors contributing to this re-concentration of poverty.
Another recent study by the Urban Institute details policy options that are available to address the issue of poverty concentration and help promote economic mobility.
People disagree on what level of income inequality is good for society, but most agree that large numbers of people living in poverty is bad, particularly if those people have little opportunity to improve their condition. For this reason, economic mobility may be a more effective lens through which to frame and assess policies: whether or not the US economic meritocracy provides a fair opportunity for those at the bottom of the income ladder to advance.

How land is zoned can be a critical factor in reducing income inequality and reducing the number of people living in poverty by providing good options for the poor to secure safe, affordable, stable housing options and to begin to build wealth.
My friend Andrew Rasiej recently called on the civic technology community to look at the political process as the next great frontier that needs fixing. Andrew says that working to do good in civic tech and not focusing on fixing our broken political process is like putting sand back on the beach after a storm. It will sadly erode again.
Hes rightas a community, those in the world of civic technology and government reform need to direct more of their attention to the election and appointment of government officials. These are the people who make the rules that dictate how government works,  and for whom.
As we do this (and I sure hope that we do) I think it is important that we not forget that focusing on the political process is more than just something we need to care about once every four years when there is a presidential election looming. We need to care about local officials at the county, city, town and village level, and those they appoint to local bodies like zoning commissions.
We need more transparency around the zoning process, more data and the creation of uniform standards so that we can systematically evaluate how land use decisions get made and how they might impact people that live in our communities.
Zoning rules can seem arcane, and the process for adopting them confusing (even boring). But in a way, the process for establishing how land use rules gets made is tied to the destiny of the people that live in our communities. I cant think of a more important challenge for the civic technology community to take on than making this process more open, more inclusive, and more likely to produce better outcomes for everyone.

Todays civic-tech must-read: Our own Andrew Rasiej reflects in Civicist on this weeks third annual CityLab conference, hosted by The Atlantic magazine, the Bloomberg Foundation and the Aspen Institute, which he attended in London. He writes that the movement to innovate government using technology has never been more robust, but warns: we are all missing something fundamental that is preventing any of our collective work from becoming transformative....All of us in the field of government re-invention will fail unless we bring our energy and ideas to the urgent need to innovate the political processes that deliver to us the government we truly want.


He adds, The theory that government innovation will eventually be so successful that its benefits will trickle back up the food chain and deliver us better politics is a false premise. Politics is the horse and government is the cart and we can have the fanciest cart on the planet but it is being pulled by an elephant and a donkey that when combined cast a shadow that looks like a pig. (And leaves just as bad a mess.)

First Post 



Justin Trudeau in 2013 (Joseph Morris/Flickr)
As the dust settles on the Liberal Partys victory in Canadas recent federal election, websites designed to facilitate and promote various forms of tactical voting are analyzing the impact they might have had on the results.
Going into the 2015 campaign, sentiment against the incumbent Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper was so high more than half of New Democratic Party (NDP) supporters were willing to vote Liberal to defeat him, and vice versa. With limited potential to gain support from the Canadian majority who subscribe to values more progressive than those he represented, Harpers best hope of staying in office was to see the left-leaning vote split evenly between the other two major parties.
Among the web tools trying to stop this from happening were vote swapping hubs, which helped citizens to trade, for instance, a Liberal vote in one carefully chosen riding for an NDP vote in another, in the hopes of giving each swappers preferred party a better chance of winning a seat.
There were also websites encouraging so-called strategic voting, which means voting for the person who has the best chance of beating your least favourite partys candidate, without asking anybody to vote for your favourite party elsewhere in return. Votetogether.ca, for example, made it easy for users to find and interpret the poll data they would need to cast a strategic vote, once they had entered their postal codes into a web form. In addition, the site raised awareness of strategic voting via social mediacollecting over 90,000 Canadians formal pledges to vote for whichever candidates had the best shot at defeating the Conservativesand even mobilized volunteer phone teams and door-to-door canvassers to promote the idea.
Since the reasoning behind peoples voting decisions isnt recorded anywhere, its impossible to measure the impact of strategic voting with absolute certainty, but experts believe it did influence the election outcome. The NDP, whose share of the popular vote slid from 30.6% in 2011 to 19.7% in 2015, appear to have received the short end of the stick in a number of ridings. After starting strong but then falling behind the Liberals in the polls during the first few weeks of the campaign, the NDPs downward spiral was probably amplified by the willingness of strategic voters to flock to whichever party was ahead.
Green Party leader Elizabeth May stated publicly that she believes strategic voting is the reason why her party won only one seat. People would come up to me, she said, and tell me I love what youre doing... but this time around I cant vote Green because we have to get rid of Harper.
Presumably she wouldnt have the same complaint about vote swapping, which preserves the overall vote count for each party, albeit at a cost to certain individual candidates. The administrators of Vote Swap Canada 2015 note that a number of Green supporters, who were looking for swaps in ridings where the Greens had a fighting chance, did not manage to find a partner. Some NDP supporters had the same problem.
Between the two most prominent swapping hubs this election, Vote Swap Canada 2015 and voteswapping.ca, only around two thousand votes were formally traded: a dip from previous years. The latter site, which had planned to focus its energies and poll funds on swing ridings, found it a challenge to figure out where these ridings actually were, according to administrator Jim Harris. The electorate was more volatile than usual, and a lot of the ridings that were close last time were looking solidly Liberal by the end of the campaign. If there had been more close races, then we would have been able to make more matches, and each match would have made a greater difference, too.
Nevertheless, Harris doesnt regret having invested his time and effort into the experiment. There were a lot of different groups attacking the Harper Conservatives from all different angles. It appears as though Leadnow [the organization behind votetogether.ca] were the ones who were really effective this time. At any rate, Im glad see Harper go.
Voteswapping.ca will remain live for the foreseeable future as a means of raising awareness about the concept. It may or may not actively match swappers for the next election, although the team at Vote Swap Canada 2015 expects that swapping and other kinds of tactical voting will continue to exist for as long as Canada has a first-past-the-post elections system. Prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau promised electoral reform on the campaign trail, but after having benefitted from FPTP during this election, he may find it tempting to renege on that pledge.

CanadaElections 



Mayors Boris Johnson of London and Mike Bloomberg of NYC at this weeks CityLab conference.
I just returned from London where I attended the terrific 3rd annual CityLab conference organized by the Atlantic Magazine and the Bloomberg Foundation, with support of the Aspen Institute. I am inspired.
In two days I met and spoke with dozens of people, part of over 400 who were in attendance who are working tirelessly on trying to figure out how to make cities work better for the people who live in them, and by extension better for the other 50 percent of the worlds population who dont. In presentations including a very strong and passionate one by former NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg, I heard many people including mayors of other major cities speak with enthusiasm about their efforts, some successful, some not, to instill innovation in government.
Also speaking and sharing their passion were dozens of civic entrepreneurs who are working in and outside of government trying to solve some of societys thorniest problems. Among them were Mike Bracken, the recently departed director of the U.K. Government Digital Service, Sascha Haselmayer of CityMart, Catherine Bracy of Code for America, Ben Hecht of Living Cities, Dominic Campbell of FutureGov, ElsaMarie DSilva of Safe City, Hillary Hartley of 18F, and many others. Also participating were leaders from the community of funders supporting government innovation including Alaina Harkness of the MacArthur Foundation, Alissa Black from the Omidyar Network, and and Geoff Mulgan of NESTA.
The topics covered were not just the usual perennial ones associated with government innovation (or the lack thereof) like procurement, transportation, congestion, public housing and health, crime, citizen engagement, or sustainability in the face of global warming. CityLab also grappled with new ones ripped from the front pages such as the refugee crisis, the lack of trust between police and citizens, and the various disruptive sharing economy issues.
For those of you in the civic innovation arena who were not there, dont worry, you were not only well represented by peers who are echoing your work, you should take comfort in knowing that the community of people working together to make government work better for citizens around the world is as robust as it has ever been.
Whats Different Now
In the last several years we have seen an incredible new interest in the potential for technological and other forms of innovation to re-invent government and with it rejuvenate the civic experience. What is different now is the number of government leaders and staff participating in various initiatives seems far greater, more earnest, and certainly more sincere. This, coupled with the fact that the information technologies are now more ubiquitous, more powerful, and getting easier to use. Their impact can be more accurately measured than even a short time ago. There is a great deal to feel optimistic about.
Other innovations that are not in themselves technological are being more easily evangelized, shared, and replicated because of information technology. Among them are new designs of the physical layout of cities like this, how to animate cities with culture, and how to prepare them for the changing global workforce and climate change.
For someone who has been working in the civic innovation arena for almost 20 years, I am truly amazed at how large the community interest has become. However as optimistic the trend seems to be, I still sense we are all missing something fundamental that is preventing any of our collective work from becoming transformative to the degree we want.
Yes, it can be fairly argued that Government has truly joined the innovation revolution. We have all the buzz words, sayings, and titles that are commensurate and borrowed from or inspired by the private sector such as disrupting government, open government data, offices of innovation, or urban mechanics, participatory budgeting, Gov 2.0, government as a platform, govtech, civic tech, etc. But Government is still underpinned by something many of us pay lots of attention to but few of us know how to disrupt or innovate.
Thats politics.
We all see results when we design and build better systems wherever that might be. But the system we use for delivering us the government we are working with is broken to such a degree that many of us turn away and instead console ourselves by putting our civic energy into government innovation.
All of us in the field of government re-invention will fail unless we bring our energy and ideas to the urgent need to innovate the political processes that deliver to us the government we truly want. I fear that the theory that using technology, data analytics, and agile methods to make our government work better, run faster, and be more responsive, without addressing the dysfunctions of our politics is massively flawed. By not paying equal attention to this side of the equation we are making a fatal mistake.
At every one of the conferences we all attend and in countless meetings we all have there is constant talk about changing the culture inside government. Great! But what about changing the culture of politics?
We all know the corrupting and distorting influences of money in the political system is a core part of the problem. And we all know that gerrymandered districts, discriminatory ballot access, antiquated voting systems, artificially entrenched political parties, endless presidential campaigns, are also deeply rooted bugs in our political systems design, some that were put there by the original coders, the Founders, and others that have been added by subsequent generations of incumbents, not all well-meaning.
There may be some good ideas out there to fix some of these problems but one of them is not government innovation. The theory that government innovation will eventually be so successful that its benefits will trickle back up the food chain and deliver us better politics is a false premise. Politics is the horse and government is the cart and we can have the fanciest cart on the planet but it is being pulled by an elephant and a donkey that when combined cast a shadow that looks like a pig. (And leaves just as bad a mess.)
If you agree with me that those of us working to innovate government need to put equal energy into innovating politics, we dont have to start from scratch. There is actually a community of people working on this problem at the local and federal levels. The problem is we are mostly working in silos, and frankly, struggling for the resources to experiment long enough to gain traction and make a difference.
I know this because I see them at Civic Hall and at our annual Personal Democracy Forum, and at various other events throughout the year. Some organizations working to fix politics have been around for years like Common Cause, Rock the Vote, Demos, and Taxpayers for Common Sense, and while they may need help innovating themselves they continue to passionately fight to fix our political system. Some are relatively new organizations like the Sunlight Foundation (full disclosure: I consult for them), The Democracy Fund (full disclosure: Civic Hall has received grants from them), PopVox, Democracy Works, Maplight, MayDayPAC, TakeBack.org, WhyTuesday.org, Citizen University, Indivisible, the Pluribus Project, VoteRunLead, Citizen Engagement Lab, Color of Change, 18 Million Rising, BetaNYC, Councilmatic, and many more.
And for all of these, there is just not enough. If you created a list of organizations working on innovation in government around the country today it would be endless. The amount of money going into government innovation dwarfs how much is going into political innovation.
If you talk with most people in the tech community you hear either the perspective that technology will eventually disrupt politics the same way it disrupts all other markets, or you see investors seeking a profit helping start-ups sell innovation to government. What you dont see is enough investment or experimentation in developing a more effective, transparent, and equitable democracy. This a real problem and something we need to address if we ever hope to achieve the lasting effect of all of our collective good work.

This is a response to Susan Crawfords recent piece Getting Over Uber.
My problem with Uber all along has been that its optimized for a really specific utility, but at the expense of others. Its a bit like online universities, which offer courses isolated from the fabric of education or a learning community. Thats the nature of any digital business: you get what you program for, but lose everything else  and sometimes it doesnt come back.
Remember what Clearchannel did to the FM dial? They bought it all up, and replaced local stations and deep music knowledge with long-distance, computer-generated play lists. It was all excused as free market capitalism; thanks to VC they had more money, so they were entitled to purchase the landscape. Eventually, the non-local Clearchannel FM stations proved they werent profitable enough to sustain the companys valuation, so Clearchannel began selling them. But the institutional knowledge enjoyed by those original FM stations was gone.
Uber may be of great utility in the limited frame of providing low-cost rides for people with smartphones. But it does not serve any of the other functions that a local taxi service does. Meanwhile, its programmed not just to provide rides, but to take out competition. It is a platform monopoly in the making. This is because it cannot support its multi-billion-dollar valuation by being a ride broker.
Uber needs to create a platform monopoly so that it can leverage into other verticals, from logistics to self-driving cars. If anything, Ubers drivers are research and development for Ubers driverless future. They are spending their labor and capital investments (cars) on their own future unemployment. And even that would be okay, if they were shareholders in Uber capable of participating in those future profits  but its not a worker-owned cooperative at all.
As every economist since Adam Smith and before has known, the factors of production are land, labor, and capitaland sometimes entrepreneurial effort. But the current digital economy rewards only capital, and acts as if acknowledging the contributions of land and labor were a communist, regulatory plot.
The people providing the labor and the communities providing the territory for Ubers operations deserve an equal say in the way the company works, and revenues the company earns.

About that other election: Canadians are voting today in national elections that could remove the ruling Conservative party from power. Its only been an eleven-week campaign, which for Canadians is apparently too long, Ben Terris reports for the Washington Post. (If American national elections were that truncated, the whole political campaign/tech industry would probably go up in smoke.) 


Heres a backgrounder from Google Canada on the role the internet is playing in #elxn42 (thats the hashtag you want to follow). Some interesting tidbits: 30 percent of Canadians say the internet is their primary information source for politics. A similar number are digital-only and have no cable TV or satellite connection. Voters who favor a change in government are more likely to rely on the internet for news. And 56 percent of Canadian voters say they have used a search engine to fact check something a candidate or party has said.


Evan Solomons review of the campaigns major turning points explains fairly well how the change theme has played in the election and why it is likely to put Liberal Party candidate Justin Trudeau into power.


Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harpers declaration that he opposed the niqabstating that he wouldnt permit a Muslim woman to wear the traditional veil during a citizenship ceremonyapparently got the most interactions on Facebook, ITBusiness.ca reports. The Conservatives tried to capitalize on that attention by announcing a police hotline for people to report barbaric cultural practices.


The Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau has promised to pour nearly a billion dollars into the countrys start-up and innovation sectors, the CBC reported.

Eileen Guo is the founder of the digital media agency Impassion Afghanistan and the creator and curator of the Afghan Social Media Summit. Days before the third annual Afghan Social Media Summit (ASMS), Civicist chatted with Guo about the changing social media landscape, the first Afghan Social Media Awards, and the most exciting civic tech projects in Afghanistan.
What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.
Civicist: What was the impulse behind the first Afghan Social Media Summit? What were your goals?
Eileen Guo: When we started Impassion back in 2013, social media was starting to play a larger role in Afghan politics, culture, and daily life. It was kind of this undercurrent that everyone knew about, but it wasnt really recognized publicly yet as the powerful force that it was (and would be). And with the 2014 presidential elections coming up, there was a lot of interest in bringing social media and tech to the forefront. A couple of things really happened at once that brought the social media summit to life: The international community in Afghanistan, especially the State Department, wanted to find a way to engage youth in the conversation as well as in civic engagement, and we, meanwhile, were really pushing to leverage social media as a tool.
So the State Dept. put out an RFP [Request for Proposal] to put together a social media summit as well as conduct provincial trainings and create a citizen journalism platform, and we responded and won the bid to conduct the summit and trainings. We ended up creating a citizen journalism platform anyway, because we saw the need for it, out of our own pocket. [Read Rebecca Chaos techPresident piece on the citizen journalism platform Guo built here.]
Civicist: What were the biggest issues facing social media users in Afghanistan at the time?
EG: I think infrastructure and access have always been big issueswhile ISPs and telecoms have been improving their services, internet in Afghanistan is notoriously spotty.
Other issues: a lack of basic awareness on privacy and cyber-security on both an individual and organizational level, a wariness as to the negatives of social media, cultural and generational resistance, censorship issues, etc.
Civicist: And these are all ongoing issues? Whats changed in the past few years?
EG: Well its interestingI see the 2014 presidential elections as really the point where social media in Afghanistan came into its own. There was a very real concern as to social medias potential for inciting violence during the elections dispute period. For example, I think the biggest changes have been in terms of infrastructure and access, which have improved a lot in the past few yearsthe government recently launched its own telecom with the aim of decreasing costsas well as general awareness among the population of social media.
Its fascinating thougheven when you go into rural areas of Afghanistan, even those that might have never used these social networks themselves recognize the word Facebook because its so prevalent. Its very much a part of Afghan culture now.
Civicist: What about the third annual ASMS are you most excited about?
EG: The first two years of the Afghan Social Media Summit were really proofs of concept, and this year its bigger than ever, 1,200 participants registered from 27 of 34 provinces, and also has better content and bigger-name speakers. Its also the launch of something that Ive personally dreamed of doing since we started Impassion Afghanistan, which are the Afghan Social Media Awards.
We started Impassion really with the goal of creating a sustainable self-driving ecosystem of Afghan internet users, and everything that weve done sincecreating the largest citizen journalism platform in the country, Paiwandgah; running the Afghan Social Media Summit; teaching basic-level social media workshops in hard-to-access provincesall of this helps drive towards that goal.
The Afghan Social Media Awards, which this year will be giving out awards in ten categories and will be broadcast on national TV, provides an incentive for individuals and organizations to strive to improve their social media use, while also teaching attendees and viewers about what makes for good social media use.
Civicist: When we spoke previously, you said that technology is one of the few, if not the only, sectors still growing and doing well in Afghanistanwhat about civic tech? Are there any exciting and positive community- or government-driven tech projects for the public good?
EG: Yes, definitely, and thats actually a key focus of the summit. For example, TOLO, the countrys largest television station, will be launching their civic media project at our event, a government accountability project with both TV and web tie-ins. The TOLO project is currently in beta and will only launch officially in a few days. Its based on/inspired by SadRoz.af, the platform that we created to monitor the first 100 days of the presidency. (You can see the similarities throughout.)
But more generally, there is a lot of interest in using technology for citizen-government relations, both within the government itself (President Ashraf Ghani is a big supporter of tech and actually ran a social media campaign back in 2009 during his first campaign for the presidency) as well as via the international donor community.
Civicist: Anything else youd like to add?
EG: Afghans are a very proud peopleand rightfully so. Whats really exciting to me about technology and social media in Afghanistan is that it is an area where Afghans are legitimately right to be proud. The amount of progress thats been made in a decade is very exciting, and its gotten to the point where its not even fair to say simply that Afghanistan has leap-frogged in terms of tech adoptionin some cases its actually leading the way regionally, and this is a focus of this years event as well.
Civicist: Anything in particular you want to point to as a source of pride?
EG: That the 3G network came to Afghanistan before Pakistan [in 2012; Pakistan got it in 2014] is a huge point of pride. And (to a smaller scale and to a more specific audience) [the fact] that initiatives like CodeWeekend, Hour of Code, Founders Institute, etc. are starting to gain popularity.
Relatedly, technology is an area where Afghans, especially young Afghans, really feel connected to the global community. Not only in that Afghans are now able to connect to others around the world on Facebook or YouTube (which is of course huge), but that Afghanistan is playing a role on the world stage in terms of tech.
So I guess what Im really trying to get across is that Afghan internet usersas well as internet users in developing countriesare a force to be reckoned with, and internet companies, policy-makers, etc, should take note. Theyre only starting to realize their own power, but its a large population that is coming online for the first time, but as they continue to do so and their numbers grow, the companies/service providers/policy makers that can cater to them are going to benefit.
Civicist: What do you think the impact of these new users will be on the internet?
EG: I love that question! And thats another [topic] well be discussing at the event.
Afghan users understand and use the internet and social media slightly differently from in other parts of the world due to cultural, economic, and historical context. For example: while the actual percentage of social media users is low, the offline-online linkages mean that the actual reach is much higher, because when a text message (from a presidential campaign, as has happened) comes in, a family or mosque or other community will have it read out loud. And so how do advertisers create messages that take into account this kind of context? Thats a question that our agency is working on.
Or how do we leverage the amount of offline blue-tooth social sharing, which has created kind of an underground social network? Or redesign popular web and mobile apps for illiterate populations?
I mean, one of my best female friends in Afghanistan is illiterate, and yet we communicate regularly on WhatsApp and Skype. Its incredible how much shes managed to learn to use these services without knowing how to read, but what if we were to design apps that are specifically aimed at people like her?
Civicist: Absolutely! This is great, thank you for taking the time to chat, Eileen.

The Congressional Management Foundation has released a new report detailing how Congress acts and reacts on social media.

The Faith contingent at the People's Climate March. (Peter Bowden)


This morning a group of climate activists and canoe enthusiasts    will float from Columbia, Missouri, to Jefferson City, Missouri, to
deliver petitions supporting carbon reductions to the Governor. This afternoon, protesters    will demonstrate outside of a Volkswagen dealership in
    Tucson, Arizona. And this evening, New York activists and intellectuals will ponder the
    citys relationship to trash. These are just three events, of roughly 175, planned as part of the
    National Day of Action for the peoples climate. Just over a year after the Peoples Climate Marchthe largest climate-related demonstration in history,
    even if the oft-touted estimate of 400,000 marchers is too generous
    the Peoples Climate Movement is finally finding its legs.


After the wildly successful demonstration last year, the fate of the coalition responsible for the Peoples Climate March was uncertain. As    I wrote in May, support for the hubs platform, the
    digital infrastructure that made the march
    inclusive and easy to join, was discontinued after the march was over, in part because of a lack of resources as well as skepticism about the platforms
    usefulness moving forward.
The hubs platform wasnt the only piece to be neglected in the months following the march. There was lots of organizing and
    infrastructure that we created for the march that wasnt maintained, Tammy Shapiro, the hubs coordinator, told Civicist earlier this year.


    Once you move a lot of people into action and build structures its really important to keep those structures supported, says Paul Getsos, a national
    coordinator both this year and last, as well as an author of the book Tools for Radical Democracy. Nobody realized
    how big and how important and how successful the march was going to be at getting people engaged. As organizers from 350.org told Civicist earlier this
    year, the original intention was not to create a permanent Peoples Climate organization.


    It wasnt until a retreat this February, attended by representatives of around 50 organizations, that they decided to turn the March into a Movement
    and began planning the October day of action.


    Although Getsos says partner organizations have been great at financially supporting a core staff, he characterized the operation this year as barebones,
a stark contrast to the march last year, which was so well-financed that it attracted    criticism for being a corporate PR campaign.


If the march last year was about demonstrating unity and sheer numbersto the detriment,    some argued, of a meaningful agendathe coordinated
    action this year is about individual communities. The fourteenth is a day to really lift up local organizing work, Getsos explains to Civicist.


    Build-Your-Own Action


    To support the National Day of Action, the Peoples Climate Movement (PCM) created a downloadable toolkit, a resource for organizers that
    includes a suggested to-do list (Prioritize building an inclusive team; Reach out to local organizations that may be supportive, especially
    underrepresented groups); suggested targets (elected representatives; local corporations) and actions (office takeover; banner drop; flash mob); and how
    to spread the word and boost attendance. They also provided tip sheets, press release templates, and talking points of various lengths in both English and
Spanish. In collaboration with Climate Prints, PCM released    downloadable posters designed by artists like Marcus Blake, Chip Thomas, and Melanie Cervantes,
    that people could use to spread the word about the National Day of Action.


    Getsos says that the open source aspect of the organizing allows anyone to pick it up, although the capacity to support them isnt what it was last year:


    In the march planning last year we had a very strong digital operation. We had a very strong social media operation. I think we had a very strong open
    source hubs model situation.


    I think trying to transfer those skills and that work into 100 places around the country is a little bit challenging...we really dont have the resources
    and the capacity now to do that in a way that we were able to do it when everything was focused in on one spot.



    Through partner organizations like the Sierra Club and 350.org, campaign director Nick Espinosa says more than two million emails have been sent directing
    people to the online map of national actions to join. PCM also emailed the 65,000 people who signed up
    during the march last year, and the 40,000 who have liked their Facebook page. On behalf of PCM, Tammy Shapiro reached back out to the listserv of hub
    coordinators.


    I emailed the coordinators I was in touch with for my earlier story. Of the six, only Christopher Wahmhoff, a coordinator in Kalamazoo, got back in touch
    with me to say that he was organizing an action today, targeting Congressman Fred Upton
    (R-MI).

Although the hubs are all but defunct, at least officially (theyve been essentially archived here), the quirkiness, individualism, passion, and creativity they were made to support is still evident in the National Day of Action (see: the canoe enthusiasts in Missouri). Months ago, the social media coordinator for the march last year tweeted that many hubs were still active on Facebook.

    We were surprised to see such a strong response to the call for action around the country, with over 175 events registered as of today, Nick Espinosa
    wrote in an email to Civicist. To me that is a strong sign that there is a lot of movement energy out there to be harnessed, especially on the road to
    the climate negotiations in Paris.


    Our hope, he added, is that the tools weve given people will help them continue organizing in their local communities, and that we can continue to
    offer some support over time.


    If the PCM suffered through neglect last year, it seems as though that mistake will not be repeated. Paul Getsos tells Civicist that they are already thinking
    strategically about what to do after October 14.

The New Organizing Institute was folded into Wellstone Action last week, and yesterday Civicist contributing editor Matt Stempeck shared these thoughts on why we still need what NOI gave me.

Last Friday, the New Organizing Institutes Board announced that the organization would be folded into another political training organization, Wellstone Action. The announcement followed major internal conflict in February of this year. Here Matt Stempeck reflects on the community NOI built in the often tumultuous industry of political organizing.
#NOIgaveme an opportunity to share what I had learned there with others, and to contribute back to the community
 Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) October 9, 2015

The New Organizing Institute was always a community as much as it was an organization. After the 2004s presidential campaign loss, some of the top digital agents from the Howard Dean and John Kerry campaigns got together with colleagues to rebuild. Their network was looser and more diverse than the formality suggested by the word institute. They were the new guard in politics, disrupting the establishment players not with computers and data, although they had those, too, but with a renewed interest in and patience for populism, meritocracy, and participatory politics. There werent always congressional candidates worthy of their talents, but they set to work changing how candidates campaign anyway, buoyed by the Democrats retaking Congress in 2006 and the election of Barack Obama to the Senate, among other victories.

The Howard Dean campaign was a short-lived but illuminating moment in the nations political imagination. It opened the doors of the professional campaign industry to a new generation that was eager to employ technology more effectively. Yet by the time I graduated college in 2006, DCs political operatives and consultanciesincluding the Democratshad hardly budged in their top-down worldviews. It wasnt clear if the new generations tech-driven, empathy-centric way of doing things was going to disrupt the Beltway, or just get us all jobs on social media teams. Since then, Ive seen my peers assume influential roles in important institutions where theyre involved in strategic decision making. The United States Digital Services (a common example recently, but hardly the only one) has worked to administration-proof itself and insulate its hundreds of forthcoming staff across the federal government, where they are better situated to outlast individual administrations while continuing their vital capacity building. The full impact of our disruption is still to be determined, but at least were doing more than tweeting.
And I will never forget that #NOIGaveMe the life I always dreamed about. Brb, going to get @HillaryClinton elected. <3

I found the NOI community because on my graduation day, my undergraduate thesis advisor handed me the semi-translucent business card of one Michael Silberman. My advisor had connected the dots between my sprawling thesis on the disruptive influence of participatory media on the traditional political establishment, and the online politics panel where hed seen Michael. Michael was the wunderkind coordinating the Dean campaigns supporter engine of Meetup groups and rallies. Following the campaign, the core tech team started EchoDitto (now Echo & Co.), an open-source Drupal development shop, aspiring to build not just open websites, but open movements. EchoDitto was small by design; its founders never wanted to scale like their peers at Blue State Digital.
#NOIgaveme inspiration, support, a staffing pipeline, professional development, friends. It radically opened my mind to so many things.
 Nicole Aro (@nekaro) October 9, 2015

I managed to parlay Silbermans business card into an awkward K Street Starbucks interview, and then an internship with a monthly stipend that covered the exact amount of my rent. After spending the fall learning to manage clients, I was hired full-time to the strategy team. My job at EchoDitto was never easy, but it was exhilarating. I believed in our clients work and benefitted from my coworkers talents. It took a long time for it to sink in that people were paying me money to use the coolest new tech to do good in the world. EchoDitto was a small company and very much a part of the broader D.C. political tech community that NOI inhabited. That community provided many of the opportunities, much of the meaning, and most of the camaraderie I ever found working in the trying industry of idealist politics.
#noigaveme the tools to build a career. i fell into digital organizing by accident. i stayed there on purpose because of NOI.
 Rachel LaBruyere (@raylab) October 9, 2015

As an NOI Advisory Board member, Michael introduced me to NOI founder and executive director Judith Freeman, and my awe and shyness disappeared when she dropped her first casual curse minutes into our conversation over beers in Cleveland Park. People like Judith, Michael, and Nicco Mele (also EchoDitto) ruined me for life by establishing very early in my career the formidable precedent of politically important and talented managers and mentors who were also humble, genuine, and nice.
#NOIgaveme everything. a career, a path to create real change, essential skills, a community of fellow practitioners, and my best friends.
 DJ Overdrive (@overdriveDJ) October 9, 2015

I joined NOI on the first business day of 2010. In the year-and-a-half that I worked as one of the core staff members, I assumed the de facto role of communications and new media, mainly because I was simultaneously incredibly proud of the work my colleagues were doing and shocked that no one was sharing it on our website, much less with the rest of the world. Nearly every single staff person outside of a core admin team was running a programmany of them junior-level employees. They were individually leading national programs with a leanness that made DCs other resource-strapped nonprofits look bloated, somehow extending themselves into ever-larger cascading networks of organizers, instructors, master trainers, volunteers, and trainees. I made it my job to take on any and all tasks that would employ tech and communications to scale such a tiny cadre into more capacity than we had any right achieving. I also learned pretty much everything I now know about campaign strategy, theory of change, and engagement organizing, lessons Ive taken with me everywhere Ive gone since.
#NOIgaveme life-long friendships. People like @tianaej @McBenefit @Kw3si @asherhuey @kweidleman dont just grow on trees. (and so many more)
 Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) October 9, 2015

NOI as we knew it is gone now. Ill let those who were closer to the action write, or not write, about the particulars of the past year. The relationships the organization cultivated live on (see the #NOIgaveme hashtag Evan Sutton started for a small sample, and note how often other people are mentioned). Maybe this is the real benefit of a network-modeled organization that invested in forging ever more dense connections within its ever-expanding community: even if the organization shuts down, the network remains. I hope that Wellstone Action can integrate the best of NOI into their trainings.
One of the more unique things NOI achieved was establishing a home base in the transient and often lonely, always challenging profession of campaign work. Beyond the professional opportunities NOI opened to so many, and the peer network that helped keep you at the top of your game, the NOI community provided comfort when you needed it, as recently as Jake Brewers memorial service just two weeks ago. Whether or not it comes with 501(c)3 status and programmatic work, we still need a home for organizers.

Tech and the presidentials: Adam Pasick and Tim Fernholz report for Quartz on The Groundwork, an until-now little-known tech vendor for Hillary Clintons presidential campaign that is funded by Google billionaire Eric Schmidt and run by Michael Slaby, the CTO of Barack Obamas 2008 campaign. They write: Groundwork has been tasked with building the technological infrastructure to ingest massive amounts of information about voters, and develop tools that will help the campaign target them for fundraising, advertising, outreach, and get-out-the-vote effortsessentially to create a political version of a customer relationship management (CRM) system, like the one that Salesforce.com runs for commerce, but for prospective voters. In other words, Groundwork is supposed to solve the data integration problem that has bedeviled modern campaigns since the dawn of time.


Pasick and Fernholz deftly point out that Schmidts investment in the Groundwork has allowed him to avoid the complex dance required of Super PACs that supposedly dont coordinate with campaigns: a well-connected donor like Schmidt can fund a startup to do top-grade work for a campaign, with the financial outlay structured as an investment, not a donation.


The Irvine Foundation has published a new report, Testing New Technologies in Mobilizing Voters of Color. It found that personal contact is still the most effective way to turn out voters, beating texting voters or using Facebook ads to urge them to vote. (Is that really surprising?) The report notes that since the study took place in the context of the 2014 off-year election, voter attention was lower. The study did not look at how the use of voter targeting or mobile canvassing tools might improve voter turnout.


Brave new world: In the last ten years, social media usage by American adults has zoomed from 7 percent to 65 percent, Pew Research Centers Andrew Perrin reports. The shift has been pronounced even among people over the age of 65, of whom 35 percent now use social media.


The internet is a mirror of the real world, sometimes making more visible what was invisible and sometimes amplifying our worst impulses. Thats the import of this long and incredibly detailed story by Sam Levin of the East Bay Express on how white Oakland residents are increasingly using Nextdoor.com to racially profile their black neighbors. Roughly 20 percent of all Nextdoor conversations in Oakland are about crime and safety, he reports. Levins story is nuanced enough to point out that the problem predates Nextdoor, noting that when listservs starting gaining usage in Oakland they also became hotbeds for rumor-mongering. He also notes that the company, which has more than $100 million in venture funding and has expanded rapidly in the city in recent years, isnt responding to concerns that its neighborhood social networking sites are intensifying white racism. If anything, the company seems to like that it is becoming a de facto neighborhood watch platform.


Pulitzer-winning national security report Barton Gellman describes how the video a public talk on the NSA and Edward Snowden he gave at Purdue University in late September was scrubbed from the schools website after someone reported to the Defense Security Service that a few of his slides were still officially classified even though they have been widely reported in the press.


The Electronic Frontier Foundations Dave Maass is cheering the enactment of the states new Electronic Communications Privacy Act, saying that it will protect Californians by by requiring a warrant for digital records, including emails and texts, as well as a users geographical location. These protections apply not only to your devices, but to online services that store your data. Only two other states have so far offered these protections: Maine and Utah.


Bostons data-driven city managers are now trying to combine all of their data on everything from crime to housing to Wi-Fi availability and turn it into a single numeric, called CityScore, reports Jess Bidgood for the New York Times.

Residency requirements for municipal employees are a contentious topic among local government officials, city employees, and taxpayers.
The idea that city employees will be more invested in their jobs and perform at a higher level if they live in the cities for which they work underpins most of the logic behind municipal residency requirements. Critics of these policies say it limits the personal freedom of city employees and shrinks the pool of potential candidates for local government jobs.
It is interesting for me to note the role that the City of Philadelphia has played in establishing the legal foundation supporting municipal residency requirementsa well known 1976 Supreme Court Case brought by a Philadelphia firefighter upheld the constitutionality of these policies. My own experience with residency requirements also comes from the City of Philadelphia and it has very much informed my opinion of these policies in general.
I believe that the single most effective way that city governments could improve their ability to recruit and retain talented technology employees is to eliminate residency requirements for IT staff.
Before the Board
Soon after the euphoria and excitement of being selected as the City of Philadelphias first Chief Data Officer wore off, my wife and I were faced with the sobering reality that we would need to find a new home. Philadelphia requires employees to establish [their] bona fide residence in the City within six months of [their] appointment. The day after I began my new job, we put our home in Wilmington, Delaware, on the market and began to evaluate different neighborhoods in Philadelphia.
In some ways, we had it easier than others who might have had to relocatewe lived less than 30 miles from Philadelphia, and my wife had worked in the University City section of Philly for several years. She wouldnt need to find a new job, but we would need to find new childcare for our two children (and the third that was on the way). We also wanted to make sure that the neighborhood where we relocated had good amenities for kids and was in the catchment area for a good school, which can be a challenge in Philly.
Despite our advantages, this process (not surprisingly) was enormously stressful and disruptive for our family, and took a lot longer than we initially anticipated.
Philadelphias residency requirement authorizes a body called the Administrative Board to grant waivers for up to six months at a time. As the six-month deadline on my residency closed in, I was told to prepare for a meeting with the Administrative Board where I could request a six-month extension.
In preparation for this meeting, I was told to put together a written request with details on why I would need an extension and to demonstrate that I was making a good faith effort to relocate. This made sense, and I could clearly demonstrate that my house had been on the market since the second day of my employment with the city. I could even share the details of the one and only purchase offer we had received by that time, which had unfortunately fallen through, and that we had subsequently lowered our asking price to expedite a sale.
But then, I started to get more ominous advice from my boss and others who had gone in front of the Board before me. I was told that the Mayor regularly grilled those that came before the Board asking for a residency extension, pointedly asking them why they werent trying hard enough to move into the city. This advice was framed in the context of hes just going to give you the business, he does that to everybody.
Still, I was nervous as I made my way to City Hall to appear before the Administrative Board.
When my spot on the agenda came around, I was indeed asked very pointedly by the Mayor why I had not yet relocated: Are you trying to avoid the citys requirement to relocate? Given the time, effort, and money my wife and I had invested in trying to move to Philadelphia for the privilege of working for the city, I was a bit taken back by these questions, and more than a little offended.
But my discomfort paled in comparison to another applicant at the same meeting. Like me, he was also an employee in the technology department. Unlike me, he was there to request a second six-month extension to the residency policy. The members of the Board and others assembled in the City Hall conference room that day seemed to almost lean forward in preparation of the interrogation that this guy was going to get when the meeting agenda came around to him. Thinking back, I recall feeling an odd mixture of anticipation and embarrassment.
After an initially spirited grilling, it quickly became apparent that my fellow applicant was facing some serious issues. He was going through a messy divorce and child care dispute, and he was underwater on the mortgage for his house. He wanted to relocate but was simply unable to due to some awful personal circumstances. The Board rapidly lost its appetite for grilling him and quickly concluded its business for the day.
I dont relate this story to take cheap shots at the Mayor or any other city official; they may feel they have good reason to approach requests for waivers to the city residency policy in this way. As one Deputy Mayor remarked to me when I discussed it with him,This is just how we do things, this is just how we do it.
It did, however, make a significant impression on me.
I distinctly remember leaving City Hall after that meeting and thinking that if one were to sit down and design a system that attracted highly talented, highly passionate technology employees into city government, it would look like the exact opposite of what I had just experienced.
Technology Employees are Different
Technology employees are fairly unique among those that work in government.
For many of the job types that support core government servicesteachers, police, firefighters, building inspectorsgovernments are not usually in direct competition with the private sector for the skills required for these jobs. This is not universally true; there are plenty of jobs that have applicable skills sets in both the public and private sectorsdoctors, electricians, administrative assistants, etc.and sometimes teachers and firefighters leave government and take up private sector jobs in their industry.
But technology employees are an exception. In almost no other job type are the skills required to do it as evenly applicable to both public sector and private sector positions. The skills required to manage IT systems, build software applications, administer databases, and develop websites are the same whether an IT worker is employed by the government, a private company, or nonprofit.
When school districts recruit teachers, they are largely competing against other school districts for the talents of people that are trained and certified to teach. When governments recruit technology employees, they are almost always competing with private sector employers who can offer higher salaries, better benefits, and the option to work remotely.
It isnt a level playing field, and residency requirements for government technology employees skew it even further.
Equally as important, the technology industry is one where remote teams, or teams made up of employees from disparate locations, are common. The tools to support these kinds of teams are cheap, plentiful, and powerful and most technology employees have experience using them. Technology companies can leverage these tools and benefit from a significantly wider pool of potential employeesincreasing the odds of recruiting more talented employees and usually speeding the time required to replace those that depart.
Its worth noting that when I worked for the City of Philadelphiaat that time, a dozen years into the twenty-first centurythere was no official remote work policy for technology employees. None. Not even a draft that was being developed.
In the City of Philadelphia, technology work is work that you do in your office or in another city building and it is reflected in its entirety in your bi-weekly timesheet. Period.
Time for a Mindset Change on Residency
The experience of 18F and the United States Digital Service at the federal level show that there are talented technology workerslots of themwho are committed to public service. Governments actually can recruit top talent, and bringing these workers into government to work on really difficult issues can make a difference.
One of the primary disadvantages that cities and counties have in attracting highly skilled technology workers (and keeping them) is the requirement that they live within specific geographic boundaries.
As we move further and further into the digital age, the governments that are most successful at exploiting technology to improve performance and efficiency will be those that are built to attract and retain highly skilled technology employees.
Its time for local government to rethink residency requirements for technology employees.

Selfies from ELECTricity coaching sessions (Center for Technology and Civic Life)
In 2013, Whitney May and the team at the Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL) began a 7-month listening tour to understand the challenges election administrators around the country face publishing information online. They interviewed nearly 100 administrators through conferences and site visits, exploring the points of pride and of pain in the government officials everyday work. Their goal was to ultimately build technology that could help these government officials do their jobs better. To do so, their first step was to build relationships.
To one extent or another, the CTCL team had all previously been on the other side of the table, working as election data providers. (May herself used to be an election administrator in Durham County, North Carolina.) But even with the personal and professional experiences of the CTCL team, they knew that they would not be able to fully tackle the daily data needs of election officials with a single solution. There are too many factors, too many particularities of place and jurisdiction and resource-access for people outside the system to make the right call on tools.
But people in the system can make the right call. They can identify their own obstacles and, when connected to each other, evaluate common methods and guidelines for overcoming these challenges. They can, with their own digital mastery (more than access to digital tools and digital literacy), create the tools they need togetherif and when they need them.
So, when it came time to build, CTCL decided to prioritize co-production above tool production. They let election administrators guide the process. The result wasnt a tool, but an emerging suite of tools, what CTCL calls ELECTricity.
(Center for Technology and Civic Life)
ELECTricity is defined as a learning community of election officials who believe that technology can improve our democracyand functionally, thats how it plays out. Although the CTCL team built a website template in response to the first wave of interviews and feedback from administrators, they did so through a process that connected people to each other and to digital skills as they went along. The result isnt a one-and-done website-builder. Its a network that, fueled by collaboration on one simple tool, can respond and grow and adapt to serve its own needs. This is civic tech.
But there are too few stories like ELECTricity in the big tent of civic tech.
A year ago I stood in front of a giant yellow backdrop with the words BUILD WITH NOT FOR blazing behind me. My goal wasnt to become the poster girl for the latest slogan in our still-emerging field, but to call attention to a division between our declared aspirations (make government work for everybody! serve public good!) and our corresponding actions.

If there is a consistent narrative to the work of civic tech, its that we believe that we can use tools to make our democracy work better. I believe this, too, and I think that this belief, broadly held, is genuine. Our intentions for civic tech are good. But intention is not action, and what it means to make our democracy work better is not singularnot something we civic technologists should decide on our own.
There is no shared experience of America, no single navigation of our democracy that we can improve. There are instead many Americas, many conditions and contexts and experiences that clash and hide, mesh and coexist, whether or not were aware of them. Its a philosophical point with real-world implications: whether you think of your experience as universal or personal changes how you identify social problems, how you form teams to work on solutions, who you include, which solutions you pursue, and what happens next.
Although civic tech has inherited the values of openness and sharing from the free culture and open source movements that preceded us, we have more collaboration we need to do if we want our civic work to truly be transformative. We have to learn how to work not just with tech communities and particular government partners of interest, but also in deep partnership with the wide array of civic actors and organizations already enmeshed and working in the democratic landscapes we are trying to affect.
Remember: democracy is a form of government that people create collectively. Whos directly involved in that creation and whose involvement is assumed by proxyby people acting on their behalfchanges how the system works. Although we civic technologists have found power in our ability to create tools, it doesnt mean that just by creating technology we are sharing that power.
So what does it mean to share power? What does civic technology look like if we were to approach it differently?
Over decades and generations, many different fieldsfrom journalism to education to the arts to environmental sciencehave asked similar questions. Which is to say that there is a lot out there that civic tech can learn from. And shortly after my talk at the Code for America Summit last year, I teamed up with the Smart Chicago Collaborative as part of the Knight Foundations Community Information Challenge to begin concentrated research into just that. In the spirit of working through the lens of context, this first phase of research I conducted focused on exploring collaboration in technology: projects like ELECTricity and others that develop through community direction and in response to expressed, collective needs. Projects that serve public good, whether or not they identify themselves as civic tech.
Last week, during a workshop I held on this research at this years Code for America Summit, we released a book with our findings: Experimental Modes of Civic Engagement in Civic Tech (Meet People Where They Are). You can download a free PDF of the book here or buy the paperback version on Amazon.
Experimental Modes is our first attempt to answer the question what does it mean to build with, not for? in a nuts and bolts way, based on the real experience of practitioners who do the work. Through a combination of independent review and in-depth self-reporting, I identified five common strategies (modes) and a number of associated tactics that civic technologists can (and do) deploy to integrate community perspectives and deep engagement into the workand to better integrate themselves into the communities they work for.
The technologies I studied varied from QR codes to radio towers, mobile apps to hotlines, but the strategies involved were largely the same. Chief among them: invest in relationship-building, partner with hyperlocal groups with intersecting interests, lead from common physical and cultural spaces, build the tool that fits (not the tool you want), and be a community participant. Not just a participant in any community. A participant in the community you are trying to serve.
Describing the approach CTCL took when creating ELECTricity during a convening held as part of the Experimental Modes project, Whitney May shared a simple equation: Information + Invitation = Participation. When CTCL sought to work with election administrators, they didnt assume that their expertise in delivering top-notch technical products would be enough to ensure that administrators felt ownership of the tools created. So instead they made sure to mesh every step of their process with invitation. They invited administrators to be part of the creation, and they make this invitation as an equal party, giving their community (the administrators!) the power to push back and to leadto do the work together.
Civic tech starts and ends with peoplewith relationships that bridge many different divides. Over the past five years (or decade, depending on how you slice it), this idea has formed a powerful beacon, summoning folks from across the country and all corners of the world together to talk about what we can do with our skills for our country (our counties, our cities, our towns...). What happens next, whether and how we move towards these goals, depends entirely on us. How much do we care about making democracy better versus making governments better? How much are we willing to explore not just the information we produce but the quality of the invitations we extend? How much are we willing to not just issue invitations, but seek them out from others, too?
Are we ready to talk about civic technology not as an end in itself, but as part of a more verdant civic process?
I dont have the answers. Were going to have to find those together. My only hope is to some degree Experimental Modes can be a partner helping to advance that process. Take a read. Let me know what you thinkand where you want to go.

Civic EngagementCivic Tech 




Rich thinking: Mark Pincus of Zynga thinks itd be pretty cool for a million people to raise one billion dollars to run Mike Bloomberg for president. Through Kickstarter. His friend Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn says its not going to happen. Thats just one highlight of Nicholas Lemanns lengthy New Yorker profile of Hoffman, todays must-read.
    



Given that both Pincus and Hoffman dropped one million dollars each on President Obamas re-election Priorities USA Super PAC, and Hoffman tossed Lawrence Lessigs MayDayPAC another million in 2014, you have to pay attention to how they talk about reviving civic engagement. Check out this idea from Pincus:
Summer of Love. Should I remind you of the concept? The idea is that, in 2017, its the fiftieth anniversary of the original Summer of Love in San Francisco. Can we use that to generate a year-long summer of service? Pincus explained that a series of rock concerts might be organized, offering tickets competitively through a new app. Start in San Francisco. It could be gamified civic engagement. Its a different narrative for tech. Its not the narrative thats been written for us. Its disruption on an establishment level, not a tech level. I spoke to Bono about it, and he went nuts!




Speaking of big money and civic engagement, of the more than 18,000 grants since 2011 cataloged by the Foundation Center as focused on strengthening American democracy, just 962 have been focused on technology. Thats just $215 million out of a total of $2.435 billion, and just six foundationsKnight, Ford, Gates, Omidyar, the California Endowment, and Sloanhave provided more than half of that. In a guest op-ed for Philanthropy News Digest, I look at why so many major American foundations dont seem to get tech.




Tech and the presidentials: Heres our Jessica McKenzie reporting on Sen. Marco Rubios appearance at Civic Hall yesterday to talk about the on-demand economy.




Issie Lapowsky of Wired also reports on Rubios tech talk at Civic Hall.




This is civic tech: The New York State Senate has just launched the most innovative legislative website in the country, Jessica McKenzie reports for Civicist. A new feature shows senators up-to-the-minute constituent support for and opposition to proposed bills.




Lawrence Grodeska, founder of the Civicmakers Meetup in San Francisco, takes his stab at defining civic tech, arguing that it is as a new big tent movement for democracy that encapsulates many smaller segments, such as gov tech, online campaigning, digital advocacy, and voting tech.




Food for thought: If you are political activist who uses social media, you should read this interview by Kate Aronoff in Waging Nonviolence with Elijah Armstrong and Rachel Gilmer of Floridas Dream Defenders, who have been at the epicenter there in the Movement for Black Lives. Theyre in the middle of a six-week self-imposed social media sabbatical, which theyve taken because theyre unhappy with how the culture of 24-7 online engagement is warping their work.

Yesterday Civis Analytics unveiled Civis Media Optimizer, which promises to drag TV advertising into the digital age. This is based on a product with the same name that the Obama 12 campaign used to improve its ad targeting. Television advertising is the biggest expenditure line in political campaigns, and that isnt going to change anytime soon. Optimizer lets campaigns, nonprofits, and companies spend those advertising dollars more efficiently.
The logic of the Media Optimizer is pretty simple, actually. (Its the math and the data behind it that are really frickin hard.): Better audience data + better pricing data = more impressions at lower costs. Optimizer tracks rich audience data (who watches what shows and when?) and pricing data (how much does it cost to advertise on each channel at each time slot?) to determine the highest return-on-investment for each ad slot. So if your target audience watches Monday Night Football and then tunes in for reruns of Seinfeld, Optimizer will tell you to buy Seinfeld rerun advertisements. Theyre cheaper. (Watch Carol Davidsen talk about Obamas Optimizer at PDF 15)
That being said, the rollout of Civiss Media Optimizer provides a nice opportunity to reflect on exactly how data is changing politics. The most interesting thing about Optimizer might be what it doesnt try to do.
Here are two things that Optimizer wont change:

It doesnt change the long-term drift away from live television viewership. We are a less captive audience today than we were a decade or two ago. The trend in TV viewership is toward time-delayed viewing (recording on your DVR and then skipping past commercials), and cord-cutting/unbundling (getting rid of the cable subscription entirely in favor of HBO GO, Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, etc). In the 2014 election, the Off The Grid survey conducted by Google, Targeted Victory, and Well & Lighthouse found that 29 percent of likely voters do not watch live television in a given week. That trend is going to continue in 2016 and beyond. Optimizer doesnt bring the live television audience back. It just gives campaigns and companies better data so they can adapt.

It doesnt change the content of the ads themselves. Most debates about the internet and elections revolve around microtargeting. As campaigns learn more and more about the citizens theyre trying to persuade, the big worry is that we will enter into a new golden age of hyper-targeted propaganda, with campaigns representing themselves one way to Citizen A and a different way to Citizen B, all aided by heaps of analytics. Optimizer is a much more common-sense application of analytics. It doesnt change which advertisements a campaign or company produces. It just helps campaigns and companies find the audience that it was intending to target already.

One could argue that the Media Optimizer will eventually affect the content of advertisements. Maybe, if companies and campaigns have more ad dollars to spend (because of the savings from Optimizer) and see better results from those advertisements, them they might invest that money in producing a wider range of advertisements and start targeting narrower segments of the public. But thats a long ways down the road, if it ever happens at all. Optimizer isnt actually a tool for campaign microtargeting. Its a tool for improving campaign targeting.
Civiss product is potentially a big step forward for campaigns and companies. Its bad for traditional ad consultants, whose cushy gig now faces some legit competition. For citizens/consumers, its pretty neutral. Well see more ads targeted at people like us on the shows we watch live. Well still skip past those ads when we watch online or on DVR. And the cord-cutting/time-delaying trend is only going to get stronger over time.
And thats a nice reminder about analytics/algorithms/the internet and the disruption of politics: yeah, some of these new products represent a big change. But it often isnt the change we were expecting or fearing.

New NYSenate.gov homepage
The New York State Senate website relaunched today with a mobile-first face lift and a new feature that shows senators up-to-the-minute constituent support for and opposition to proposed bills. The redesign is meant to increase public participation in the legislative process and make possible more efficient communication between New Yorkers and their representatives.
In addition to looking much better, on mobile and desktop, the new interactive features on the New York Senate site are, observers say, the most innovative of any legislative website in the country.
The old layout for individual senators pages.
Before contacting their senator, New York residents must first create an account by providing their name, email, and home address. From the user dashboard, residents can follow issues, look up bills, and write to their senator. Any feedback givenpetitions signed or bills supported with an aye or opposed with a nayis sent, not to the author of the petition or sponsor of the bill, but to the senator that represents that New Yorker.
New layout for individual senators pages.
Constituents support for and opposition to bills on the active listthe list of bills expected to make it to the floor for a vote that dayis shown to senators in easy-to-read bar graphs right alongside the bills up for a vote, and if the senator refreshes the page the graphs update in real time.
A joint message from Senators John Flanagan and Jeff Klein states:
This groundbreaking tool for democracy provides users with fresh and interactive ways to make their voices heard and will better spark meaningful two-way dialogue between legislators and the constituents they represent.

Andrew Hoppin, the former chief information officer of the New York State Senate, who oversaw the launch of the original NYSenate.gov, tells Civicist that the new site sets a new bar for legislative websites in the world.
As the team that built the prior version in 2009, under Democratic leadership, he said, were really excited that the new Republican leadership didnt roll back the transparency and open government initiatives but actually doubled down on them.
Hoppin says the site is open source, runs on Drupal, and could easily serve as a model for other legislative websites. It is fully integrated with Bluebird, the open-source CRM Hoppins team built during his tenure.
Hoppin points out that while the previous site was primarily about getting information out into the world, the new site is also about collecting information. He said the aye/nay voting function allows the senators to scale up their collection of constituent feedback to an unprecedented degree.
Every bill page asks Do you support this legislation?
Hoppin also praised the Issues function, which makes it easy for constituents to follow the bills and news updates that are of interest to them without having to sort the wheat from the chaff every time they visit the site.
Find and follow issues of interest.
I give the Senate credit for doing something really ambitious, Hoppin said, pushing the envelope beyond what is tried and true.
In a statement emailed to Civicist, Seamus Kraft, the executive director of the OpenGov Foundation, said:
A citizens right to petition their government is fundamental to American democracy. But that right is often limited to those with enough money, time and influence to make their elected officials actually listen. With its new website, the New York State Senate is taking necessary steps to secure that right for as many New Yorkers as possible.

He went on to praise the listening function that the platform provides:
Tools that are just one-way opinion blasters from the outside, and that do not give equal weight to the needs of users inside legislatures who have to make sense out of the noise, overwhelm resource-strapped staff and make it virtually impossible for meaningful dialogue to happen. After giving the new New York Senate website a test drive, it appears that Ryan Blair [lead technologist at the New York Senate and, full disclosure, a Civic Hall member] and his talented team get that implicitly. They not only encourage citizens to participate, but empower staff and members to truly listen and act on what they hear.

It will be interesting to see which state legislatures follow New Yorks lead in the coming years.

GovTechOpen Government 





Tech and the presidentials: Speaking at Civic Hall this morning, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said in a prepared speech that both parties were to blame for not innovating fast enough to keep up with the on-demand economy (his preferred descriptor). He also decried regulations lobbied for by incumbent interests like the taxi industry and the hotel industry for blocking the growth of companies like Uber and Airbnb.
Rubio also touted Handy, which helps self-employed trades professionals get jobs, for enabling upward mobility and offering people greater flexibility to choose their work hours, noting that the average Handy worker makes $18 an hour. He said it was shameful that the biggest obstacle to growth of this company was our very own government. He concluded: We have to change the way our political establishment thinks about the new economy.


During a Q&A session with Civic Hall founder Andrew Rasiej, Rubio declared that he wasnt in favor of eliminating the federal minimum wage (contrary to prior reports) but that he opposed raising it.


Asked about the U.S. Digital Service and whether he would continue it were he elected president, he said If it proves that its something that is effective and that it can attract the brightest minds to improve how government works, then thats something we should definitely continue.

Our Jessica McKenzie covered the event in a bit more detail for Civicist.

The future of work: The Guardians Alex Hern argues its time to stop referring to the sharing economy, saying that the gig economy is a much better descriptor for whats actually going on: a dependence on tenuous labor, particularly that provided by individuals working as third-party contractors rather than full employees.


A recent survey by the Freelancers Union found that nearly 54 million people, or one-third of the work force, are doing freelance work. According to the survey, 86 percent of the nations freelancers are likely to vote in 2016, and 62 percent are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports freelancers interests.


As Katie Benner reports for the New York Times, politicians are turning more to gig economy startups like Thumbtack, Munchery, and Managed by Q, for advice on how to address their needs.

But, he adds, the U.S. Justice Department has made no effort to contact him to discuss any plea deal.

This morning Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio dropped by Civic Hall to deliver a prepared speech on the on-demand economy, followed by a Q&A with Civic Hall founder Andrew Rasiej. In his speech, Rubio touted the advantages of the on-demand economy, including upward mobility, flexibility, and independence. He argued that all of the best innovation is happening in the unregulated space and said his proposed tax reform plan would make the tax code more welcoming to the on-demand economy. Many of Rubios prepared comments tracked with other speeches he has given on the subject, although this one was without any explicit jabs at fellow candidates.
Rubio highlighted New York-based Handy as an innovative startup facing overregulation, and said another entrepreneur he met recently asked him not to name his company publicly to avoid drawing the attention of legislators.
Rubio called for a new category of worker, pointing out that those with W2 status have more protections but fewer of the freedoms that characterize the on-demand economy, but if employees are categorized as independent contractors, employers are prevented from training them or otherwise dictating how something is done. Rubio argued that a middle ground is needed, pointing out Germany already has a third category for dependent contractors. He added, Whether or not this model is the best for America is something we have to figure out.
To cut down on innovation-stifling regulation, Rubio proposed a cap on the amount that regulations can cost the economy, saying current compliance costs approach $70 billion. Rubio singled out regulation lobbied for by incumbent interests like the taxi and hotel industries for hindering competition.
When Andrew Rasiej pushed him on the root issue that makes it possible for established interests to have their waymoney in politicsRubio first said that small government is the answer: If unlimited regulation is an option, he argued, incumbent interests will find a public safety argument and use that to put up a roadblock. In response to Rasiejs follow up question, again about the influence of money in politics, Rubio said that the American people should stop electing people susceptible to that. But he didnt offer any ideas for how to achieve that.
Citing the impact of Airbnb on the housing market, Rasiej asked how the government could minimize the collateral effects of the on-demand economy without regulation. Rubio responded that hes not against all regulationhes glad that his drinking water isnt poisoned and that someone is checking on the planes he flies onbut added that structural change in the economy has always been very disruptive and pointed out that the industrial revolution brought about a number of new issues, including child labor, that had to be resolved.
Rubio repeated himself somewhat when a member of the audiencean independent taxi driverasked whether new companies and drivers should have the same access to the market that he has, but without paying the same fees. Rubio first replied that he doesnt think its the same model, but reiterated that innovation is always disruptive, citing the impact of the car on the horse cab driver. Rubio said that it is the role of government not to prevent innovation, but to help people affected get access to the new innovative economy, whether through education or other means.
Rubio was dismissive of the potential for worker-owned cooperative platforms to compete with other startups, saying, I dont think youre going to get innovation that way...people arent driven to do it if they dont see the opportunity to make money.
Finally, when asked by Rasiej whether he would continue to support the U.S. Digital Service if he were elected president, Rubio said, If it proves that its something that is effective and that it can attract the brightest minds to improve how government works, then thats something we should definitely continue.

Future, Imperfect: In America, Google searches for gun shop tend to be more popular than gun control but after the mass shooting in Oregon late last week, that trend flipped, Lorenzo Ligato reports for the Huffington Post. Among the top queries people ask are, What do police say about gun control? and Why does nothing get done about gun control?


According to Google search trends, public interest in America in a mass shooting tends to last a month, at best, Emily Badger and Kevin Schaul report for the Washington Post. They write, It doesnt gradually recede with time as memories often do; it disappears, abruptly.


A proposal that would let Uber and Lyft drivers form nonprofit organizations to collectively bargain on their behalf is making progress through the Seattle city council, Daniel Beekman reports for the Seattle Times.


Tech and the presidentials: The presidential candidate with the most Facebook followers is....Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon. As Jon Ward reports for Yahoo Politics, Carson has more than 4 million followers, compared to 3.9 million for Donald Trump, 2.1 million for Bernie Sanders, 1.5 million for Hillary Clinton, and 1 million for Marco Rubio. Carsons success online mirrors his broad base of small donors, who gave his campaign $20 million in the third quarter of 2015.


Meanwhile, Donald Trump has become the champion of Twitter, as this devastating profile from Michael Barbaro in the New York Times shows. He writes: Over the past two months, on Twitter alone, he has been mentioned in 6.3 million conversations, eight times as many as Republican rivals like Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carsonnot to mention more than three times as many as Hillary Rodham Clinton and nearly four times as many as Bernie Sanders. He is retweeted more than twice as often as Mrs. Clinton and about 13 times more frequently than Jeb Bush, according to data compiled as of Friday by Edelman Berland, a market research firm that studies social media.


Long-shot Democratic presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig, who crowdfunded $1 million in order to run a one-issue campaign for political reform, takes to Politico Magazine to complain that the Democratic party has been refusing to recognize his candidacy, preventing him from qualifying for this months first presidential debate.


This is civic tech: In Civicist, Daniel X. ONeil of the Smart Chicago Collaborative explains why The Real Heart of Civic Tech Isnt Code but the hidden workers like the teens who worked in its youth-led tech program this summer, the regular Chicago residents who work in its documenters program, and its health navigators. He writes:

Civic tech that doesnt include people like Akya, Angel, and Farhad leads to a distorted vision of the field. A vision that leads with technical solutions rather than human capacity. A vision that glorifies the power of the developer rather than the collective strengths of a city.

First night of instructor training (Daniel X. O'Neil)

Civic tech is a hot field. Theres lots of attention in government and media circles and a series of new investments. With this weeks Code for America Summit, which wraps in Oakland today, the field has never been brighter.
Smart Chicago is deep in traditional civic tech

Smart Chicago is deeply tied to the work of Code for America. Earlier this week I wrote on the Smart Chicago blog about all of the connections we have to many of the people who presented at the Summit.


This includes some of the brightest developers, like Ian Dees, who is deeply involved in OpenStreetMap leadership; one of the strongest members of the Code for America Brigade, Christopher Whitaker; a leading thinker in the digital divide, Denise Linn; a Code for America fellowship year that lead to the largest implementation of Open 311 anywhere.


This robust set of people and projects makes Smart Chicago one of the largest and most sophisticated civic tech outfits in the country. We maintain an immense amount of pure technology, and we were right at home in Oakland this week.

The hidden workers

But we work directly with hundreds of other people every week who werent at the summit, who have never heard of Code for America, and have never even heard the phrase civic tech.


These are our people, too. In our construct of the field, they are civic tech, too.


This includes the 18 people who worked in our Youth-Led Tech program this summer. One of them is Akya Gossit, who told her story of growing up in some of the most destructive and volatile parts of the city. This is how we found her:


My last semester of community college I interned at a nonprofit organization called Youth Guidance. During my internship I received an email blast from a colleague who wanted us to let our children know about the youth-led tech program and that they were looking for instructors as well. I applied for the position as instructor, interviewed, and here I am.


Since the end of the summer, Akya has joined us as a full-time Health Navigator.


It includes regular people from our Documenters program, which was recently covered on the Knight Foundation website. We do callouts for regular residents to get paid for attending public meetings & conferences and documenting through writing, photography, and other means. One of them is Angel Rodriguez.
Aaron Brown, Angel Rodriguez, Michael Gore, and Lucia Gonzalez of the Roseland Youth-Led Tech | Summer 2015 Team of the Smart Chicago Collaborative (Daniel X. ONeil)
Angel found out about the employment opportunity on his community Facebook page and first thought he would be part of the program as a student. A woman said if there were any young adults interested in technology. And I clicked the link and it took me to two linksone was for students (eh oh I was not eligible to sign up) and the other one was for an assistant instructor. I signed up! Angel has now taken over all documentation of sessions for our Civic User Testing Group (CUTGroup), which is a community of residents who get paid to test civic websites and apps.
It includes the dozens of people weve worked with over the years in our Smart Health Centers program, teaching computer skills in low-income health centers. One of them is Farhad Ghamsari. He came to us from our partner Chicago Health Corps, where we had posted the position. He specifically requested in his application to interview with us because he was already a technically-inclined person, and he wanted to work in that kind of environment.


While on assignment at Cook County Hospital, he was given special back-end login to hospital systems to pull numbers for our reports. This is a different kind of techie narrative that doesnt include making greenfield appsjust taking existing systems and making them work harder for all. Farhad served with us for a year and then was accepted to Northwestern Medical School. He still works part-time with us as a Health Navigator.

Deliberate paths

We encounter these hidden workers of civic tech through deliberate, structured activities. We promote on social media, spread through social services networks, and contract directly with partners who are deep into fields other than civic tech.
We dont share our framing with themyoure all now in civic tech, which is cool! Instead, we seek to discover how they approach the world, how they see their skills, their work, and their colleagues, and try to share it.
And we document exactly what weve learned in finding our civic tech co-workers, with the hope that we can spark these relationships everywhere. Most of the sharing in the civic tech field is focused on code. We publish reams of that. But what we love the most is sharing specific methods for working with real people. Weve got two books on the subject:


Experimental Modes of Civic Engagement in Civic Tech: Meeting People Where They Are. This book, published yesterday, is by Laurenellen McCann. Her work promoting build with, not for is well-known in the field, and the research and thinking in this book delivers specific modes for direct engagement with real residents. She answers the question, Whats the difference between sentiment and action?
In our Civic User Testing Group (CUTGroup), which is run by Sonja Marziano, we publish all of our methods for recruiting testers and developers, and weve compiled it into a book as well.
Theyre hiding in your cityfind them.
Civic tech that doesnt include people like Akya, Angel, and Farhad leads to a distorted vision of the field. A vision that leads with technical solutions rather than human capacity. A vision that glorifies the power of the developer rather than the collective strengths of a city.


So as the 1,200 Summit attendees get on planes, go back to their jobs, and log in to Github, I urge you to find the Akya, Angel, and Farhad in your communities. Build them into your lives and your work. The field of civic tech wont thrive without them.

The view from the summit: My favorite statement at this weeks Code for America Summit, which was attended by more than 1,200 people, was uttered by Boston CIO Jascha Franklin-Hodge, who explained why he was tired of hearing about why government should be run like a business. He said, Businesses get to choose their customers, government has to serve everyone.


Catherine Bracy, the director of community organizing at Code for America, explains to re/Codes Noah Kulwin the dangers of the app trap. She says,
Its really hard to point to when weve changed a system or weve improved some massive bureaucracy. Its often years in the making. To separate the milestones along the way of this systemic story, we fall back on talking about the apps weve built, and the way the apps sort of represent a milestone or bigger picture. And that leads us into the app trap [that] now colors the conversation. Oh, youre just about building apps. And the app is the end of the story. But its not.


GovTechs Jason Shueh offers his four key takeaways from the Code for America Summit.


This is civic tech: Kudos to Travis Moore on the launch of TechCongress, a new nonpartisan fellowship program that will place technologists in Congressional offices. Moore is a former legislative and operations director to Rep. Henry Waxman. The fellowship is a nine-month residency working directly for a Member or a Committee. Fellows may focus on technology-related issues like NSA surveillance reform, patent reform, cybersecurity or network neutrality.


Kudos to Laurenellen McCann on the publication of her new book, Experimental Modes of Engagement in Civic Tech, edited by Smart Chicagos Daniel ONeil.


MySociety are making an open call for papers for the 2016 Impacts of Civic Technology conference, which will in Barcelona April 27-28.

Food for thought: Ioby.org board member Justin Garrett Moore makes a plea that we stop using the term blight to describe the challenges facing urban communities. He writes:
Why do I consider blight a problematic word when it comes to describing our cities and communities? Blight is a borrowed term from plant pathology that refers to a number of diseases that cause damage and death. The violence of urban renewal (versions 1.0, 2.0 and now 3.0 beta) used this terminology of disease to describe a place and its people to justify the use of constitutional police power the betterment of the health, safety, morals to take property and wealth, remove people, and to literally destroy places.

For now, it seems like we're stuck with this flowery language. (Ron Mader, CC by-SA 2.0)

Yesterday, as part of the ongoing Disrupter Series, the House Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee held a hearing on the sharing economy entitled How Sharing is Faring: Growth and Adjustment in the Sharing Economy, although it was evidently later retitled How the Sharing Economy Creates Jobs, Benefits Consumers, and Raises Policy Questions.
Witnesses included a vice president of Intuit, a personal finance software company, an assistant vice president of Property Casualty Insurers, a driver-partner with Uber, the chief economist at Thumbtack, an online marketplace for specialized services, the president of the Internet Association, a trade association representing Airbnb, Intuit, Lyft, Uber, and others, and the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
Of the witnesses, only one, Jon Lieber, the chief economist at Thumbtack, pointed out that lumping these companies and issues together as the sharing economy was a mischaracterization and a problem.
Lieber said:
A quick note on terminology  because these services are essentially connecting people to other people, they have attracted a variety of ever-changing terms to describe them. One popular term  the sharing economy  is particularly inapt due to the fact that the one feature each of these services has in common is that money is being exchanged for a service. There is no actual sharing in the sense of which we learned about in preschool. The gig-economy, 1099-economy, collaborative consumption, peer-to-peer, on-demand... these terms confuse the issue of what is actually happening with the changes we are seeing in how people are turning their time and effort into money.

He went on to explain why this has policy implications:
Being precise in how we talk about these issues is important because the differences in the business models raise different sets of policy considerations. To take two prominent examples, Uber and Airbnb have both figured out how to take underutilized resources, private cars and private dwellings, and create productive assets out of them by enabling people to share them with others for a fee. But saying they are both part of the same sector totally obscures the radically different policy issues raised by both. Airbnb doesnt have the labor issues that Uber does, and Uber doesnt have the zoning and other issues that Airbnb does.

In spite of these points, it seems likely that the tyranny of the phrase sharing economy will continue, since statements by other witnesses and from the Energy and Commerce Committee use the phrase without question or air quotes.
Michael Beckerman answers some follow up questions.
These companies have an extraordinary story to tell, said Michael Beckerman, the president of The Internet Association. Their story is about job creation, economic growth, opportunity, and life changing flexibility. His breathless testimony invoked the metaphor of the tale of two cities to describe the difference between states and cities that have tried to regulate new companies (growth is stifled, and opportunities are lost), and those that have not (consumers and the local economy have seen job creation and growth).
Beckerman also made an interesting clarification about the nature of the sharing economy platforms he represents:
But first, Id like to put the sharing economy in the proper macroeconomic context. Sidecar, Uber, and Lyft are neither taxi companies nor transportation companies. They are technology platforms connecting supply and demand. Likewise, Airbnb is not a hotel or lodging company. It is a technology platform that connects supply and demand. In 1980, for example, if you wanted a ride to the airport, you might pick up the Yellow Pages and look up a phone number for a car service, then call to arrange a pickup. In that pre-Internet age, the Yellow Pages served a similar function that Lyft and Uber do today connecting supply (the driver) with demand (the rider).

Whatever Uber and Airbnb are, they are not merely the Yellow Pages.
Job growth and creation were front and center, and for the most part the sharing economy was presented as being unquestionably good in this area. In the background memo sent to the subcommittee members before the hearing, a section on Observed Benefits cited the new income opportunities.
The reasons for seeking freelance work or renters vary widely, the memo reads, and individual success stories come in myriad forms, but it is clear that a significant number of Americans are taking advantage: one survey finds that about 34 percent are freelancing, and another report projects 40 percent will be contingent workers by 2020.
Note the positive-sounding phrase taking advantage, when some cases must also be falling back on or resorting to.
Representing Uber driver-partners, Luceele Smith testified to the benefits of working for the company, praising the flexibility: I have worked in traditional jobs before, but theres nothing else out there where you can set your own schedule and set your own goals. Sometimes drivers ask me, how much do you make? I tell them, you can make as much as you want.
Reading through the testimonyof all the witnesses, not just Luceele Smithits interesting to see how easily the benefits of self-employment and the sharing economy are conflated as one and the same.
David McCabe reported for The Hill that the questions that followed split along partisan lines, with Republicans expressing concern that regulation would hurt job creation and stifle innovation and Democrats raising questions about worker protections and rights, as well as the safety of consumer data.
McCabe writes that the hearing represents the first move by Republican lawmakers to exert their authority over the issues associated with the on-demand economy, and points out that Republicans in Congress are playing catch-up with the GOP contestants in the presidential primary in this regard.
The voice of caution in the proceedings was Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who Politico identified as the Democratic witness.
He outlined a litany of risks and issues that arise from the so-called sharing economy, and his testimony should be required reading on the subject. The four categories of regulatory issues Baker identifies are: labor regulation; consumer protection regulation; property rights; and rules prohibiting discrimination in the provision of servicesan issue which had received little to no attention from others.

Its not clear from his story, though, whether Emanuelwho has run into criticism for privatizing other city services like its parking meter systemis merely seeking to shift the call-center work to a cheaper, non-unionized vendor, which could save the city a measly $1 million, or if he is looking for a company that will modernize the whole 311 system.

Tech and the presidentials: Voxs Ezra Klein has noticed that The tools that party insiders use to decide both electoral and legislative outcomes are being weakened by new technologies and changing media norms, and posits that this explains why outsiders and insurgents like Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Bernie Sanders are doing much better than party insiders want and media elites would expect. Couched that carefully, Kleins statement isnt really controversial, though clickbait being what it is, he portentously titled his post, A theory of how American politics is changing.
    

Not surprisingly, Mother Jones Kevin Drum disagrees that anything that seismic has happened.


My view: Sanders (who is close to hitting the million mark in his small donor totalone-fourth the total number of donors Barack Obama had in 2008 by the end of the election) is clearly benefiting from his and his supporters mastery of online media. I suspect that Trump, Carson and Fiorina are benefiting more from rightwing talk radio. But either way, the old Gang of 500 (Mark Halperins term for the campaign consultants, strategists, pollsters, pundits, and journalists who make up the modern-day political establishment) has far less influence over the winnowing process than ever.

The news from Facebookistan: Facebook now has a social good team, led by longtime manager Naomi Gleit, reports Seth Figerman for Mashable. He writes, Facebooks social good team, which numbers in the dozens, is less focused on activism and on-the-ground work than building a new suite of products that tap into the social causes and personal needs of its community. Gleit told him, It really is bottom up. We dont want to do whatever Mark thinks is most important or whatever I think is most important. Thats not the position we want to be in.


Perhaps this is unfair, but can we please not use social good and products that tap into in the same sentence? At least put those phrases in separate sentences?

Caitlin Dewey has a must-read piece in the Washington Post on the failure of major tech companies to offer their platforms or skills in the face of Europes humanitarian crisis, comparing their inaction to the swiftness with which they have deployed their tools (and, it might be added, PR teams) to respond to natural disasters like earthquakes. She reports that to date:
...no private firms have partnered with ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] to develop tools or technologies to help European refugees, and no one seems interested in doing much more than flinging money at charity. Neither Facebook nor Google has launched their safety check-up features in Europe, for instance, though both did after Nepals earthquake earlier this year....Microsoft-owned Skype, which has periodically made calls free after major storms and other natural disasters, hasnt extended the same courtesy to the hundreds of thousands of people now stranded in such places as Hungary and Croatia.

Instead, Dewey writes, it is volunteer civic techies like Berlins Fluchtlinge Wilkommen (Welcome Refugees) that have started to step into the gap, but they are overwhelmed by demand and having trouble raising money at the same time. (Go here if you want to donate to them.)
Pope Francis made reference to technology in his address to Congress yesterday, the Huffington Posts Alex Howard notes. It was not to his @pontifex Twitter feed, however, but to to his hope that we put technology at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.
Speaking of more integral uses of technology, Lucy Bernholz, Rob Reich, Emma Saunders-Hastings, and Emma Leeds Armstrong have developed a basic framework for ethical, safe, and effective use of digital data by civil society organizations. It has three key principles that make a lot of sense: Default to person-centered consent. Prioritize privacy and minimum viable data collection. Plan from the beginning to open (share) your work.
Deep inside this very detailed story by Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt for The Guardian on how backbencher Jeremy Corbyn won his unlikely bid to be the new leader of the UKs Labour party is this fascinating tidbit:
The digital teams secret weapon was a soft-spoken young tech expert named Ben Soffa. As the TSSAs head of digital operationswho happens to be Cat Smiths partnerSoffa was seconded to the Corbyn campaign by his union to try to give it an edge over the other campaigns, which were thought to have been vastly better prepared. Soffa created an appusing the American political organising software NationBuilderthat allowed volunteers to make calls to potential supporters from their own homes. The app provided information about an individuals Labour membership, which constituency they lived in and its electoral history. Volunteers would follow a series of questions, with the answers fed back to Soffas team through the app. The data coming back to Soffa showed a clear pattern by the end of June: Corbyn was garnering surprising levels of support from across the party, especially from the so-called three pounderspeople who had signed up to vote as registered supporters. The figures were so good that the Corbyn camp assumed they must be incorrect. The numbers are amazing, but it must just be that were finding all of Jeremys core supporters, Soffa told Smith towards the end of June. Another coup by the Corbyn camp was the prescient decision to embed the 3 registration process directly into the campaigns websiteensuring that thousands of people who visited the website were easily able to sign up. It was just an obvious, natural thing to do, Soffa recalledbut the other campaigns did not think to do it, an oversight they all now regret.

In the face of a broad backlash across the developing world, Facebook has quietly decided to rename its controversial Internet.org program Free Basics by Facebook, Newley Purnell reports for the Wall Street Journal.

If Volkswagen knew that every customer who buys a vehicle would have a right to read the source code of all the software in the vehicle, they would never even consider the cheat, because the certainty of getting caught would terrify them.

Although it would come as news to a sizeable chunk of Canadians, they do not elect their head of governmentat least not directly. Like some other nations that used to be British colonies, Canada is governed by the Westminster system, meaning the prime minister is appointed by the Queens local representative, the governor general. Normally, this official appoints the leader of the party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons, making the prime minister a democratically chosen leader in practice, if not on paper.
However, this democratic choice is arguably distorted by the first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system, in which the candidate who gets the most votes in an electoral district wins a seat. FPTP is usually (though not always) consistent with the popular vote when there are two dominant parties, as in the United States, but because most Canadian ridings (electoral districts) now have three or more non-fringe candidates, somebody can easily win a seat without earning the majority of the votes, just so long as he or she still has more votes than each of the competitors.
As a result, Canadas government is often elected by a minority of the citizens. The current prime ministers party, the Conservatives, had 39.62 percent of the popular vote in the 2011 election. The geographical distribution of these votes also happened to give the Conservatives a false majority: they hold over half of the seats in the House of Commons despite having earned under half the voteand are therefore able to pass legislation without support from any of the other parties.
Given the potential for this kind of scenario, it isnt unusual for Canadians to cast a ballot, not for the candidate they like the most, but instead for the person they believe has the best chance of defeating the candidate they like the least.
Leading up to the Canadian election scheduled for October 19, web-based vote-swapping hubs are offering another tactical option. Instead of simply voting for second- or third-choice candidates, vote swappers aim to pair up with somebody who lives in a riding where their preferred party has a real chance of winning a seat according to poll data and statistical modeling. Each partner in the swap agrees to vote for the other partners preferred party.
Dr. Mai Yasue, a conservation scientist in Vancouver, thinks her priorities are most in line with those of the Green Party, but her riding is a close three-way race between the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New Democratic Party (NDP). Although Id like to show my support for the Green Party and help them gain a reputation of being a real Canadian political party, the idea of helping to give a seat to the Conservatives is abhorrent to me, she says. She is looking to swap her vote with a Liberal Party supporter in a riding with a strong Green candidate.
Preserving the overall vote count of small parties like the Greens is one of the advantages of vote swapping. Its a way to get their leaders into the house, and these parties bring important conversations to the table, says Craig Hubley, one of the administrators behind Vote Swap Canada 2015, a Facebook group where would-be swappers can post want ads to find a partner.
Another purported advantage of swapping is that once youve committed to vote on behalf of somebody else, your conscience is more likely to send you to booth on election dayeven if youre busy or tired. It creates a feeling of solidarity between myself and the person Im swapping with, says Marena Brinkhurst, an NDP supporter voting in Nova Scotia who found a Liberal partner in Quebec through Vote Swap Canada 2015. Were in different provinces and we support different parties, but were both in the same bind and we can help each other. Its a refreshing moment of connection and trust to find during an election.
In addition, swapping offers the option of voting for a candidate whose track record or ideas you admire but who isnt running where you live. Maybe you cant stand any of the people in your riding, says Hubley. But there must be someone, somewhere in the country, whom you can respect.
Piloted in the USA
Informal vote swapping between family and friends has probably existed for decades if not longer. Even before Canadians took to the web in 2008 to swap votes with strangers, a similar endeavor had been tried during the American presidential election in 2000, when Ralph Nader supporters in swing states agreed to vote for Al Gore in exchange for Nader votes in predictable states. One of the websites facilitating these arrangements, voteswap2000.com, was threatened with criminal prosecution by Californias secretary of state, frightening it (and others) into shutting down. Seven years later, it was vindicated by a circuit courts decision that these threats had violated the website creators freedom of speech. Online vote swapping has continued playing a minor role in the United States ever since.
The Gore-Bush race was so close that Gore-Nader swaps held the potential to change the outcome, but since 2000, the margins of victory in presidential elections have been wider. In Canada, by contrast, its recently been the rule rather than the exception that a few thousand vote swaps could theoretically make the difference between a majority government (that can largely do as it pleases) and a minority one (that must cooperate to a certain extent with other parties)and once you get into tens of thousands of swaps then you could even give the government to an entirely different party and prime minister.
The challenge is making these swaps in effective places. Local riding polls are expensive, says Hubley. Theyre mostly done by parties and kept secret. In 2011, some of the publicly available riding projections were off, so that vote-swapping hubs recommendations were off, too. Thats part of the reason why, in the end, there was no seat that we could point to and say, That was us, Hubley says.
Former Green Party leader and author Jim Harris is trying to address this problem by crowd-funding polls in key swing ridings via voteswapping.ca. Statistical modeling is something to go by, but its not as reliable as an actual poll, he explains, adding that the results of any polls he manages to fund will be made available to everyone, not only to the people formally registered to swap votes on his site.
How it Works
There are several different ways a website can facilitate vote swapping. It can be a forum for posting want ads, it can host a partner-matching app, or it can be a place to register for swaps that will be orchestrated by humans behind the scenes. Each method has been tried out at least once, and each has its pros and cons. Want ads offer no privacy, but they let you zero in on exactly the type of swap youd like to make for whatever reason. Different swappers might have different strategies in mind, and they can all simultaneously pursue them in a free-for-all.
The other two methods allow, if desired, for a more coordinated strategyand administrators will ideally be transparent about what that strategy is. Voteswapping.ca, for example, is explicitly an anti-Stephen Harper site: its foremost goal is to prevent him from staying on as prime minister. Harris says this initiative is aiming to concentrate swaps in fewer ridings and make a difference, rather than spread them out where their effect would be diluted. To this end, only people who live in ridings that are known to swing between the Conservatives and another party can get a partner through voteswapping.ca. Those who live in safe ridings are encouraged to participate by spreading the word.
In the Canadian context, vote swappers tend to be anti-Conservative because the other four seat-holding partiesdespite their differencesare all left-leaning by comparison. So far, formal swappers also tend to be people who are more politically engaged than the average citizen, according to Hubley, although most of them would of course like to see swapping take off as a mainstream practice.
Neither Harris nor Hubley are game for predicting how many people will take part this year. In previous elections, the numbers have been modest but not so small that a real impact has been out of the question. In 2011, around 78,000 visitors perused votepair.ca, the largest vote-swapping hub at the time, and over 7,500 of them formally signed up. (As a point of comparison, the Conservatives won a majority government in that election by 6,201 votes.) Theres also evidence that discussing swappingor hearing that its going onmotivates more people to vote tactically, with or without a swapping partner.
The leader of the Green Party of Canada, Elizabeth May, might partially owe the seat she won in 2011 to this effect, Hubley says. The Green supporters trying to find a swap in her riding outnumbered the potential partners who had signed up there, and canvassers mentioned this when they were going door to door. Although they garnered only around 120 formal swaps this way, May defeated the Conservative incumbent by a landslide, against expectations. A lot of people there in Saanich-Gulf Islands might have said to themselves, Why should I vote in a narrow, partisan way when all these Greens are willing to look at the big picture and make a compromise? And why should a party with nearly a million supporters not have a single seat? says Hubley. Maybe it tapped into a primate fairness/reciprocity instinct.
Pressure-release valve or push towards proportional representation?
Elections Canada, the agency responsible for running federal elections, has weighed in on vote swapping only once, back in 2008. They said there is no law against it so long as no money is exchanged, but they also warned of the danger that your partner will not keep his or her promise to vote for your party of choice. Since its illegal to follow anyone into a voting booth and watch what they do, swapping must rely on an unverifiable handshake.
There would be less reason for vote swappingand for assuming its risksif elections were based at least in part on proportional representation (PR). Canadian citizens groups are advocating for this on Twitter under the hashtag #PR2015, and much of the chatter in vote-swapping web forums is about the kind of electoral reform that would make the practice obsolete.
Harris believes that vote swapping will accelerate the drive for reform, because parties and candidates would rather win or lose straightforwardly than have their fates decided by voter dealing. Also, the practices very existenceregardless of participation numbersattracts media attention and highlights certain absurdities in the first-past-the-post system.
Theres reason to believe that adding an element of proportional representation to the voting system is not just a pipedream. The Canadian constitution does not stand in the way, the New Democratic Party has committed to it and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has made it part of his election platform. Both the New Democrats and the Liberals currently have as good a chance of forming the next government as any party does.
Deciding exactly what types of reforms would best suit the country is another kettle of fish, and for his part, Hubley says he would rather stick with FPTPwith vote swapping as a pressure release valve for voter frustrationsthan end up with any of his least favorite of the possible forms of proportional representation.
Whether from active campaigns by groups like Fair Vote Canada or merely from personal experience, plenty of Canadians are aware that many votes count for nothing under FPTP. Voter turnout in 2011 was 61.1 percent, 2008 saw a record-low 58.8 percent, and the current system breeds apathy, argues Yasue. If nothing else, vote swapping is reinvigorating some citizens interest in elections by offering them a greater say. People who were feeling helpless have told me theyve stopped feeling that way, says Hubley. The psychology of the swap is empowering.

Later this week the U.N. will vote on the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of international development targets that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire at the end of 2015. The 17 new commitments include goals related to eradicating poverty, building sustainable cities, combating climate change, and more. Interestingly, the SDGs were agreed upon in a decidedly more collaborative and participatory process than the Millennium Development Goals. This included everything from thematic consultations to door-to-door surveys.
Perhaps the final language is a result of this more inclusive process. Several of the goals have civic tech implications, including two goals I find especially exciting: Goal 16.7 calls for responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. Goal 17.18 notes, By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts.
These goals frame the challenges of inclusive governance and open data as global problems. Building towards a global partnership on sustainable open data and more responsive politics are challenges with daily implications on the lives of citizens. Diverse organizations are already pledging commitments: the ONE campaigns Follow the Money portal; the DataKind and Mastercard partnership to foster data scientists to work with public sector leaders to build responsive protocols around data collection and usage; and CIVICUS is working to strengthen the capacity of civil society on SDG data initiatives, with a focus on the Global South, to name a few.
Working towards fulfilling these goals will require cutting across domestic and international divides to share lessons learned and best practices. Critically, the SDGs serve as a useful reminder that challenges are global in scope, often with local level solutions.
For more context on participatory processes around the world, read Hollies recent piece on the SDGs over at Vox.

The civic tech community is in mourning at the untimely death of Jake Brewer, senior technology advisor to the White House, who was killed Saturday while on a charity bike ride in Virginia. Here is President Obamas statement on his passing. It reads, in part:

We set out to recruit the best of the best to join their government and help us harness the power of technology and data to innovate new solutions for the 21st century. Simply put, Jake was one of the best. Armed with a brilliant mind, a big heart, and an insatiable desire to give back, Jake devoted his life to empowering people and making government work better for them.


U.S. Chief Technology Office Megan Smith said, in part, He had a generous heart and a vision for engaging with technology, data, and most importantly each other, to create opportunity and find solutions together. Jake lived and loved more in his 34 years than some people do in their whole lives.


Jakes wife, Mary Katharine Hamm, a Fox News contributor, shared her feelings on her Instagram account.


The Washington Posts Moriah Balingit and Faiz Siddiqui spoke with several of Jakes close collaborators, including Michael Silberman, who was on the charity ride with him Saturday and Jose Antonio Vargas, with whom he co-founded Define American.


Here is Define Americans statement on Jakes death.

Change.org is hosting memorial gatherings tonight for Jake at its offices in New York City, Washington and San Francisco. Jake was its director of global policy before he went to the White House.


Here is my remembrance of our friend Jake.

Jake Brewer speaking at PDF 2014
The civic tech community and our Civic Hall/Personal Democracy family lost one of its giants yesterday. Jake Brewer was killed while on a charity bike ride outside of Washington, DC. He was 34 and leaves a spouse, Mary Katharine Ham, a two-year-old daughter, Georgia, and a child on the way.
Jake had just stepped into the job of a lifetime as senior technology advisor at the White House. Before that he was the head of global policy, external affairs and new product development for Change.org for two years. Prior to that he was a partner at the new media firm Fission Strategy and the strategic communications director for U.S. Ignite, and in his spare time co-founded and co-chaired Define American. Before that he was the engagement director at the Sunlight Foundation, which is where I first got to know him. He also ran the National Civic Data Challenge for the Knight Foundation and the National Conference on Citizenship, consulted for the Americans Elect third-party project, and worked for Idealist.org, among many earlier endeavors. His resume is amazing but it hardly captures who he was.
Every time we lose someone it is horrible. But what makes this news doubly painful is that Jake was in the prime of his life and still on the rising arc of a career in good works that was rocketing higher with every day.
In May, he left what was already a dream job at Change to go work for the White House. His formal role was to lead efforts on immigration and Tech Hire, but Jake being Jake, that was just the beginning. His real work was community weaving and making vital connections and devoting all of his energy and substantial charisma in the service of what lifted up everyone, especially the least among us. At the White House, behind the scenes, he was helping to move mountains.
Just over a week ago he brought his boss, U.S. chief technology officer Megan Smith, to Civic Hall for an informal end-of-the-day visit. Going rogue, he joked. While they were here, he and I had one of those great, electric conversations that Jake always seemed to generate. We were talking about how the whole field of pro-democracy work was underfunded and how we needed to catalyze a lot more money coming in, to foster a much bigger wave of experimentation and implementation. He thought he could get the President to do it, either now or after his presidency.
Later, that evening, Jake was on the train ride home and he texted me: I keep thinking about our chat. We could do so so so many good things with $100m specifically devoted to civic tech to drive democracy in the short term. And that feels oddly achievable. I said I was up for the challenge but reminded him that right now the parts of civic tech attracting money werent really about democracy improvement. He responded, I think we can solve for both. Hard but doable. I wrote back, Lets plot. He wrote, Yes, please :) #rebelalliance.
Then, this past Wednesday morning, I saw a tweet from Jake in support of Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Texas boy who had been arrested for bringing a homemade digital clock into school. Hope the rest of the country fully celebrates Ahmeds ingenuity as result of this, while his school/town failed him, he tweeted. I replied at him, get @potus and @nasa to speak up. He direct messaged me in response, Thats being worked on...Fingers crossed. A few hours later, the President tweeted, Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? Jake DMed me: Got it. :)
There are many through-lines to Jakes life and work and Im sure other people will be chiming in with their own stories. But I want to especially highlight a particular passion of Jakeshow to make digital democracy work for real. When Jake left Change.org he had been leading a team building a new elections-focused app that will rewire how elected officials and other decision-makers communicate engage directly with the people petitioning them for attention. As someone with deep experience in online politicking, Jake had long worried publicly about what he called the tragedy of political advocacy where the Internet makes it easier for everyone to shout louder but harder for us to listen to each other in order to get to solving problems. Here he is talking at Personal Democracy Forum 2014 about the issue.
Its really worth stopping to listen closely to Jakes talk. He wasnt just trying to make it easier for activists to demand change by hitting their targets with thousands or millions of messages, he wanted to help them work with not at their targets. He also had a smart and humble understanding of the problem that not every petition was righteous and that we needed a new generation of democracy tools that would enable people to listen to each other more effectively.
Jake really was a visionary optimist who believed we could do this, and more. Heres the idea he pitched me for a keynote talk at PDF this year, which I regrettably but gently rejected because we have a standing rule against someone keynoting on the mainstage two years in a row. His emails subject was Kinda crazy presentation idea: Founding Fathers as original startup founders.

I started thinking about this yesterday on a walk, and Ive been obsessed with it ever since. It could be so much fun! 

What Id really like to do is pitch a TV / Netflix series at some point that puts the Founding Fathers in modern day times as startup founders. Kinda like HBOs Silicon Valley mashed up with the 1770s and 80s. And... 

I also think it could be a fantastic (and funny, fun!) PDF presentation with the ultimate good message that government acting more like a startup / platform is our founding ethos, and we can bring that back (which is happening ever-so-slowly with things like USDS, 18F, etc). 

The theme and point would be making a direct analogue that helps the audience see our founding as not this austere, staid thing, but as rebellious, disruptive, experimental, visionary, and making the world a better place  and all the best attributes now revered (and mocked) in Silicon Valley. 

Im thinking 15 min presentation that tells the story of a bunch of dudes in their 20s totally disrupting the status quo  pitching a crazy new idea that takes on a totally entrenched, wealthy company after moving west and bootstrapping their startup before launching. 

And then of course, once you launch and start to scale, thats when the challenge really begins... the company has to ask all kinds of questions about its principles and identity and deal with in-fighting (1781-1789). Its so good!  

Id get a great designer on it, and make up slides with things like Thomas Jefferson giving a TechCrunch Disrupt talk with the little head mounted microphone and backdrop and all that. John Adams pitching French investors... 

The story has every conceivable character. George Washington: CEO. James Madison: Systems Architect. Alexander Hamilton: CFO. John Adams: Platform Policy Director. Thomas Jefferson: Chief Strategy Officer. Ben Franklin: wizened, super-quirky, philandering advisor ! 

Needs fleshing out, but what do you think? Could be something a little different up there. 
Perhaps someone can get this idea over to Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton?
What I love best about this idea from Jake is that, beyond being a mensch, he was also at heart the best kind of American patriot. (He did two years of service as a cadet at the U.S. Naval Academy.) He saw the American revolution as unfinished, and believed that techies and open democracy activists were indeed part of the continuing #RebelAlliance fighting the Empire. And for Jake this wasnt just the kind of fun talk you have over beers, it was action too.
Today it isnt just progressives like me who are mourning him, but some libertarians and conservatives are mourning too, because Jake was both personally and professionally someone who saw beyond the red-blue divide. He was searching for a way forward, not left or right. Like many of us, he felt in his gut that the Internet offered a new and better way of doing things, including government. And now the best tribute I can imagine to him is that we try to continue his work. May his memory be a blessing.
Update: Guy Benson, Mary Katharine Hams co-author, has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Jakes kids education.

Drawing attention to potholes (Source: Gazeta.ru)
The other day during a talk with researcher Tanya Lokot I heard an interesting story from Russia. Disgusted with the state of their streets, activists started painting caricatures of government officials over potholes.
In the case of a central street in Saratov, the immediate response to one of these graffiti was this:
The cover up (Source: Vzsar.ru)
Later on, following increased media attentionand some unexpected turnaroundsthe pothole got fixed.
That reminded me of a recurrent theme in some conversations I have: Does praising and shaming matters to civic tech and, if so, to which extent? To stay with two classic examples, think of solutions such as FixMyStreet and SeeClickFix, through which citizens publicly report problems to the authorities.
When the government takes action, what prompts them to do so? At a very basic level, three hypotheses are possible:

Governments take action based on their access to distributed information about problems (which they supposedly are not aware of)
Governments take action due to the naming and shaming effect, so as not to be perceived as unresponsiveand seeking praise for responsiveness
Governments take action for both of the reasons above

Some could argue that hypothesis three is the most likely to be true, with some governments leaning more towards one reason to respond than others. Yet, the problem is that we know very little about these hypotheses, if anything. In other wordsto my knowledgewe do not know whether making reports through these platforms public makes any difference whatsoever when it comes to governments responsiveness.
Some might consider this as a useless academic exercise: as long as these tools work, who cares? But I would argue that the answer to that questions matters a lot when it comes to the design of similar civic tech initiatives meant to prompt government to action.

Lets suppose that, all else equal, governments are significantly more responsive to citizen reports when these are publicly displayed. This would have importance both in terms of process and technological design. In terms of process, for instance, civic tech initiatives would probably be more successful if they devoted part of their resources to amplify the visibility of government action and inaction (e.g. through local media). Conversely, from a technological standpoint, designers should devote substantive more effort on interfaces that maximizes praising and shaming of governments based on their performance (e.g. rankings, highlighting pending reports). Conversely, we might find that publicizing reports have very little effect in terms of responsiveness. In that case, more work would be needed to figure out which other factorsbeyond will and capacityplay a role in government responsiveness (e.g. quality of reports).
Most likely, praising and shaming would depend on a number of factors such as political competition, bureaucratic autonomy, and internal performance routines. But a finer understanding of that would not only bear an impact on the civic tech field, but across the whole accountability landscape. To date, we know very little about it. Yet one of the untapped potentials of civic technology is precisely that of conducting experiments at lowered costs. For instance, conducting randomized controlled trials on the effects on the publicization of government responsiveness should not be so complicated (e.g effects of rankings, amplifying visibility of unfixed problems). Add to that analysis of existing systems data from civic tech platforms, and some good qualitative work, and we might get a lot closer at figuring out what makes politicians and civil servants tick.
Until now, behavioral economics in public policy has been mainly about nudging citizens toward preferred choices. Yet it may be time to start also working in the opposite direction, nudging governments to be more responsive to citizens. Understanding whether praising and shaming works (and if so, how and to what extent) would be an important step in that direction.

The Internet Public Speaks: Since yesterday, more than 1,000,000 tweets have included the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed, according to Topsy.


As Manny Fernandez and Christine Hauser report for the New York Times, the massive wave of support for the 14-year-old Texas boy arrested for bringing his clock invention to school included President Obama, who tweeted his support for Ahmed Mohamed and invited him to the White House.


The police now say they wont pursue charges against Mohamed, the Dallas Morning News Avi Selk reports. The boys new Twitter account has 72,000 followers. As Selk reports:

The joke to his big sisters, Ayisha and Eyman, is that Ahmed was invisible on social media before an outcry over his arrest made him an online sensation. Their tech whiz of a brother had no Twitter account, no Facebook, no Instagram or Snapchat. So the sisters set him up on Twitter as @IStandWithAhmeda slogan that the world had given the boy as his story spread overnight. The young women stared at their phones Wednesday morning, stunned as the phrase became one of the most popular memes of the day.


These two photos of an Arab-looking man of Syrian descent in a garage w/his accomplice building what appears to be a bomb also got a lot of retweets.


This is civic tech: The winner of St. Louis GlobalHack V last weekend, which focused on creating solutions to improve the working of the citys court system, was Inveo, which, according to Matt Meniette, Global Hacks executive director, developed a platform called CommuniSee that allowed residents to easily look up and resolve tickets through a variety of methods (e.g. by name and birthdate or through a simple map). Their solution also introduced a new way for residents, municipalities, and the private sector to collaborate to reduce the number of outstanding fines and fees: a tool for corporations or nonprofits to pay off outstanding fees in exchange for volunteer work and help hard-working individuals (many of whom may already be volunteering in their community) get a fresh start.


A recent consulting project between the Department of Defense and 18F saved the DOD $150 million by taking a more technically informed approach to procurement, Federal Times Aaron Boyd reports. Thats more than the entire $105 million currently requested for the whole U.S. Digital Service.


April Glaser and Alison Macrina report for Slate on how the citizens of Lebanon, New Hampshire, came out in force Tuesday night in support of their library reinstating its Tor relay for safe, anonymous web browsing, which had been suspended after an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security. By evenings end, the librarys board voted to restore the relay. Glaser and Macrina report that dozens of libraries have contacted the Library Freedom Project as a result of the controversy, hoping to set up their own Tor nodes. They add, This weeks victory for Lebanon Libraries is a sign of hope in a post-Snowden world.


The Open State Foundation has uploaded its full Politwoops archive of more than 1.1 million deleted tweets by more than ten thousand politicians in thirty-five counties to the Internet Archive.


Tech and the presidentials: If you want to see how people watching last nights GOP debate responded in real-time on Bing Pulse, check out this page. The three questions that came from social media, as CNN anchor Jake Tapper put it, raising the issues of medical marijuana, guns, and climate change, were a refreshing break from typical debate questions that tend to focus on personalities and the horserace.

Teach our children well: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is announcing today that within ten years all city schools will be required to offer computer science to all students, Kate Taylor and Claire Cain Miller report for the New York Times. Only one percent of the citys students now get to take computer classes. Half of the $81 million to be spent to achieve this ambitious goal will come from private donors, including the AOL Charitable Foundation, the Robin Hood Foundation, and Fred and Joanne Wilson.


De Blasio might want to dispatch a few of his yet-to-be-hired computer whiz teachers to Irving, Texas, where a 14-year-old high schooler named Ahmed Mohamed was arrested Monday after his teachers called police because he brought a homemade digital clock to school and they mistook it for a bomb. As Avi Selk reports for the Dallas Morning News, the schools principal threatened to expel him if he didnt make a signed statement while being interrogated by cops and hes now been suspended for three days. Mohamed has vowed never to take an invention to school again, Selk writes.


The boys case is now blowing up online, Nicole Stockdale reports for the Dallas Morning News, with many supporters using the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed.


This photo of Ahmed Mohamed as he was walked through school in handcuffs, surrounded by cops, was shared by his sister. Yes, hes wearing a NASA t-shirt.


The city of Irving was last in the national news after its mayor claimed to be blocking the establishment of a sharia law court in the city. Politifact investigated that claim and found it to be false, noting that all that happened was a few Muslim individuals teamed up to offer Sharia-governed, non-binding mediation services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including in Irving, with the declared intent of complying with state and federal laws.


A perfect shitstorm of Islamohobia and technophobia appears to have congealed outside Dallas, writes Markus Wohlsen as the lede of his article responding to the case, telling readers of Wired how to make their own homemade clock that isnt a bomb.


Isnt it interesting what the internet public rallies around? Ahmed Mohameds case, which has instantly galvanized nerds and social justice warriors alike (some of whom are the same peopleIm thinking of the amazing Anil Dash, who is at the center of organizing support for Mohamed), is arguably the polar opposite of the Donald Trump phenomenon: smart instead of dumb, embracing the other instead of demonizing him.

He writes: Beth Niblock, [Mayor] Duggans chief information officer, said the city has benefited from strong civic tech movements launched by private or non-profit entities such as Data Driven Detroit, which helped create the Motor City Mapping database of Detroit properties. This is such a strong civic tech presence in Detroit, Niblock told about 200 attendees in the audience. They had to be strong because government wasnt functioning in Detroits pre-bankruptcy days.

California is on the verge of becoming the second state (after Oregon) to automatically register residents to vote, Andrew Prokop reports for Vox.

Writing for Politico, Andrew Zaleski uses Rep.

And Zaleski sites a Sunlight Foundation finding that says only 15 percent of congressional websites are ready for HTTPS.



It turns out Americans dont want to share power drills, writes Sarah Kessler for Fast Company. The power drill was briefly the universally cited mascot of the sharing economy (everyone owns one but nobody uses it more than 15 minutes), but the platform(s) that would allow you to share small household items never took off, or folded completely. Kessler dives into why that is, finding that there really wasnt much demand for sharing services (one co-founder of a sharing platform could not get THREE usersof the thousands who registeredto complete a transaction).
Reading now (you know what they say about hindsight) it seems obviously incongruous to talk about charging people for participating in the sharing economy. It just sounds like renting (and Kessler does point out that the most successful sharing companies are those that track most closely with traditional companies like hotels, car rental services, or taxis). From personal experience, I think that a post on Facebook would likely turn up a power drill available to borrowno middle man required.

Mexico City Skyline (Storkholm Photography via Flickr: CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)


Mexico City is huge. Over 21 million people live in the metro area, the most populous in the Western Hemisphere. Nearly 9 million people live in the federal district alone. There are pockets of immigrants from all over the world and of course the full spectrum of Mexican ethnicities. This means there are myriad interesting issues to tackle and a wide mix of opinions on how best to go about it.

From August 31September 4, 2015, the MIT Center for Civic Media traveled to Mexico City for a workshop organized by the Laboratorio para la Ciudad and MIT Media Lab. Gabriella Gomez-Mont, the Laboratorios founder and director, is a Directors Fellow at the Media Lab this year.
The workshop was an experiment in collaboration and innovation, part of the Laboratorios mission. Considering how we at the Center for Civic Media strive to design civic interventions collaboratively with local partners, this was an exciting opportunity for us.
In a few intense days, we worked with Laboratorio staff and local experts, as well as select students from nearby universities, to prototype projects worthy of Mexico Citys scale and complexity. Teams were organized by topic arealearning, data and mobility, and civic techand relied on a mix of existing and speculative technologies brought to the table by participants. Our team chose to focus on how to integrate new forms of citizen input into the planning and transformation of public spaces around the city using both digital and non-digital strategies. Our solution: EncuestaCDMX.
Mapping Citizen Input in Revitalization
Our teams thesis is that everyone in the city is an expert. Residents have an intimate understanding of the spaces they frequent within the city and have unique perspectives on associated challenges and possibilities.
On our first day, we spoke with two sets of experts to get a better understanding of the problem space. We met with members of Neri Vela, a community organization, to learn about citizen voice in the context of Mexico City and community organizing around redevelopment. We also sat down with representatives from the Public Space Authority, a government entity responsible for revitalization projects in public spaces throughout the city, to learn how they incorporate citizen input into their decision making. 
We identified opportunities to increase citizen voice and engagement in the planning process through the following channels:


a multi-modal data collection system inclusive to citizens with different levels of digital access (in-person interviews + smartphone app use), and


a public dashboard to provide analysis and visualization of collected feedback for both government officials and citizens


Our design goals for these channels emphasized securing buy-in from both officials and participating citizens. We considered the question: how might we incentivize engagement on both sides of this planning dialogue by making the input and analysis components accessible and relevant?
Test Site Identification

As a test location, we chose Libertad de los Pueblos, also known as Ho Chi Minh Park. Located two blocks away from the Laboratorio in a high traffic area, the park was an ideal pilot space due to its proximity. The space was also under consideration for revitalization according to city staff, making the feedback we were soliciting from citizens relevant and authentic. Finally, it offered the opportunity to engage with a diverse mix of citizens as it attracts all manner of commuters, vendors, bus drivers, and residents.
Community Engagement Design
Before developing our survey, we did initial viability testing with citizens in the park to hear some of their initial impressions of the area.
One man we spoke with lives far to the north of the City. He works as a plumber and comes to the park to rest on a daily basis. His true passion is dancing and he said he would be interested in joining dance events if put on in the park. This helped us confirm cultural activities as a resonant category.
Survey Development
We built on the Public Space Authoritys basic structure of prioritizing problems and opportunities by adding more experiential questions meant to assess how the space made residents feel and what words they associated with it. Through these fields we hoped to get a quick impression of what the park represents to people, rather than simply its specific problems or potential.
In order to ensure an inclusive range of feedback, we developed both digital and non-digital outlets for citizens to participate. Working with a team of surveyors, we used a tool already being deployed in Mexico City (Flocktracker) to record interview responses with over 50 users of the park during a 40 minute window.
We found citizens were happy to be asked their opinion and offered detailed feedback on how they currently used the park and what they would like to see implemented in the space.

The ENCDMX App
To complement in-person surveys, we extended the Action Path app developed by the MIT Media Labs Center for Civic Media to allow smartphone users to submit their feedback directly. The Android app sends push notifications to users as they walk by the space, asking the same questions as the in-person interviews.
Using this location-based smartphone service, we are able to engage citizens who might be in the space when official surveyors are not present. The app can also reach those who may avoid in-person surveys and might prefer to offer their opinion in a private context.
Public Dashboard
In the interests of providing both city planners and citizens with real-time feedback on the information coming in, we developed a public dashboard that aggregates and visualizes the results from both channels.
In the case of our survey of Ho Chi Minh Park, the primary concern identified by citizens was trash and overall cleanliness. About a quarter of those surveyed said that free Wi-Fi would be one of the best additions to the park. The majority, however, suggested programming we had not included in our list, such as activities for kids and vocational trainingunderlining the value of citizen expertise. The word cloud provides a quick look into the impression most people have of the park. 
Screenshot courtesy MIT Center for Civic Media
When future surveys are administered, we plan to distribute cards with the dashboard URL so that citizens can see how their responses fit into the bigger picture informing the Public Space Authoritys planning. This helps incentivize participation by closing the feedback loop, and creates an opportunity for public accountability.

Future Work
This week was a first step toward our big picture vision for engaging citizens in the planning of public spaces and capitalizing on their expertise. In the future, we want to:


Make the app and survey process more playful, experimenting with different incentive structures among citizen survey takers and official surveyors


Develop an installation like a kiosk or interactive signage that can increase the modes of engagement and thereby the inclusivity of the system

Since 2013, 18 cities within the county have launched some form of open data initiative.


Lack of funding remains a major barrier to many cities involvement in launching open data portals, along with a need for more expertise and buy-in from city departments.


There should be mechanisms for regularly tracking and publicizing stories of how open data is creating value, which can both increase public engagement with city data and help to make a case for meaningful ROI.

Always ahead of the curve, the city of Austin, Texas, launched an online community engagement portal in 2008. Called SpeakUpAustin, the platform is the cradle of the citys bike share program and played a part in shaping a plastic bag ordinance. It allows anyone with internet access to publicly share their opinion on upcoming policy decisions without having to attend a public meeting. Although this was a leap forward in terms of accessibility and convenience, participation was still limited by one major constraint: internet access. This summer, however, the city took steps to change that by using a text-based tool called HeartGov in tandem with SpeakUpAustin to poll city residents about a Ban the Box initiative.
The Ban the Box campaign to delete the part of job applications that asks about previous convictions has been around since 2004. The campaign began seeing some success (in Minnesota, for example) in 2009. Since then, cities like Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, and others have removed the question.
The Austin city council decided to follow the lead of several other cities and jurisdictions in looking at what people are calling a fair chance hiring policy, says Larry Schooler, the manager of Austins Community Engagement Division. The idea behind it is really to try to help those with criminal records, with histories of being incarcerated have a fair chance at getting hired.
The policy could mean that employers would need to delay criminal background investigations until a conditional offer was made to an applicant, even a person with a conviction, Schooler clarifies.
Schoolers position was created in 2009, when Austins communications director decided to invest more resources in engaging the public in innovative ways. Ive sort of gone from being a person to come in and facilitate meetings here and there to someone who is really trying to design a new system of public engagement, Schooler tells Civicist. Im spending a lot more time now creating tools and programs and doing trainings than I did at the beginning.
HeartGov first came to Schoolers attention after he saw a short piece I wrote last year for techPresident, about testing the tool in Brooklyn. He reached out to Asher Novek, who developed the tool as part of his masters thesis at NYUs Gallatin School, and they began discussing ways to use HeartGov in Austin. (Full disclosure: Asher Novek is a Civic Hall member and has done some contract work for Civic Hall assisting with marketing.)
Schooler decided that the public polling period for the fair hiring policy, which ended at the end of August, was the perfect opportunity. One of the reasons I wanted to use HeartGov on this one in particular is because I sensed that we needed to hear from people who were formerly incarcerated and that they might be less likely to have internet access, Schooler explains to Civicist.
Working closely with Novek, Schooler came up with three questions, one that asked what kind of companies should be subjected to a fair hiring policy, how the policy should be enforced, and how the city should implement the policy. City residents interested in providing feedback could text a local number and would get the questions one after the other in response.
The city solicited input on the hiring policy via email, text message (HeartGov), and an online discussion board (SpeakUpAustin), although Schooler notes that, because this was a relatively abridged public input period (less than a month), there was limited publicity. All told, the city received 150 online discussion posts, 175 texts (from 60 or so respondents), and a handful of emails.
Some of [the texters] were obviously people who had been formerly incarcerated and had been dealing with this on a first hand basis, says Schooler. Im not taking sides in the debate over the policybut it was really gratifying to see people so directly affected by a policy be participating like that.
A preliminary report Schooler shares with Civicist shows that the majority of text responses were in favor of the fair hiring policy, whereas the online responses were more mixed, even skewing against the policy.
There were a couple people who posted online who did seem to have some history [of convictions or incarceration], says Schooler, but not nearly to the extent that the texters did. More of the texters were employees, whereas there were greater numbers of employers responding online.
Without HeartGov, the city might have gotten a very different picture of local opinion on the fair hiring policy.
Schooler dreams of one day better integrating the text and online responses, so that participants online can see what people are texting and vice versa. He also has yet to figure out how to handle two-way communication with people using HeartGov. I didnt do any personal responses this time. There just wasnt the bandwidth for me to do that, or the time, Schooler says. In an ideal world I would in some way respondwe did respond at the end, when we closed things out, to say thanks.
The two-way conversation has always been what Asher Novek envisioned for his tool. For example, HeartGov continues to be used in some local officials offices in New York and he says he feels it is his responsibility to nag offices to respond to constituents reaching out through the tool, until it becomes a habit.
As for whats next in Austin? HeartGov has already been pulled back into service, as part of a community forum on building equitable economic development in East Austin.

When an individual applies for a loan, the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individuals social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes.

Map via Languages of the World
When it comes to languages, our country is a patchwork. Our civic infrastructure hasnt kept up with more than one or two. There might be hundreds of languages spoken in our country, but they arent spoken by our government. Like the polyglot individual, who is fluent in many languages, government bodies and agencies need to become fluent in many languages in order to serve the people. To become a polyglot democracy, we need to design infrastructure that ensures certain patches arent left behind.
A crucial first step is to work toward including all eligible voters in the electoral process.
Translation is often framed as a technical problem that can be solved through effective bureaucracy. The assumption is that if the board of elections in a certain county is able to provide translated materials for every language spoken by eligible voters in their county, then we have perfect language access. In principle, I dont disagree. However, the mere existence of a ballot in Lao, Hindi, or Mongolian is not a sufficient standard for measuring language access.
Language access is a technical problem, but not one that is solved simply by hiring translators and interpreters. Language access is about designing systems that include people in every step of the process. Language is often one of many barriers that voters face. Thats precisely why expert insight and the wisdom of communities are both crucial foundations for the polyglot democracy.
Tanzila Ahmed, whose organizing acumen is a constant inspiration, has applied a decade and a half of experience in Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) electoral organizing to develop a theory of change model where low voter turnout isnt caused by voter apathy, but rather that AAPI voters experience severe barriers when it comes to casting a ballot. She identifies five such barriers:

a barrier to voting information;
a barrier to the mechanics of voting;
a barrier to engagement;
a barrier to in-language resources; and
a barrier to voting rights.

These five barriers also translate to five critical needs that cant be ignored when we talk about designing for a sufficient standard of language access.
An expanded standard of access means doing more than providing a written translation of any given ballot available. We also need to:

provide voter guides to help voters understand issues;
streamline the process of voting, so they can navigate its often complex mechanics; and
match them with an actual human from their community who can help make sense of a large volume of brand new information and help troubleshoot problems as they arise.

Thats precisely what were trying to do with VoterVOX, the newest tool from the Asian American & Pacific Islander new media organizers 18MillionRising.org. The app, currently in development, will connect Limited English Proficient (LEP) voters with multilingual volunteers to help them understand their ballots.
Communities that include LEP voters already have the expertise needed to include those voters in the democratic process. Creating access isnt a matter of delivering information from a central source to LEP voters, but a matter of helping communities organize themselves. VoterVOX is as much about community organizing as it is about voting, and one-to-one connections are a vital component. I dont want to build software that languishes in app stores or online. I want to build a tool that uses the beating heart of our communities to circulate fresh blood to its furthest-flung limbs.
Were designing VoterVOX to include input from stakeholdersfrom LEP elders to multilingual high school kids to organizers working at the grassroots levelin order to understand their needs and expectations when it comes to community technology. Regardless of what the outcomes of working with these folks might be, we have some core assumptions about designand language access more broadlythat guide our efforts to engage them in the first place.
Committing ourselves to language access means committing to providing more than just translated ballots. Translated ballots are just the first of many steps toward trying to change a culture around civic participation. Through a well-designed workflow for ballot translation, we can simultaneously create conditions that foster engagement where discrimination, lack of information, and structural exclusion have previously made participation difficult, if not impossible. When were designing to expand access to the ballot box in a landscape of problems, were working to right structural wrongs.
Designing for inclusion isnt easy. In fact, its very difficultotherwise this effort wouldnt be needed.
Good design wont restore key provisions in the Voting Rights Act, the key law that has expanded access to the vote for millions of voters, which was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. We still need to fight to protect the voting rights of all citizens of this country, in the streets and in the courts. We still need to pressure county boards of elections to do the right thing and obey the law by providing translated voting materials when theyre required to.
That work starts at home, in our communities. By building opportunities for connection between people with expertise and people with need, were changing the language around democratic participation. In the one-to-one link between a volunteer translator and a voter, an opportunity for organizing grows. That organizing is the real meat of civic engagementits fuel for the long game of language access in a polyglot democracy. True language access requires a commitment to organizing by design.

Blasts from the past: The State Department has posted a whole batch of Hillary Clintons emails (4,368 in all) in searchable format, though the Wall Street Journals tool works a bit better. Some fascinating finds to those of us with an interest in Clintons policies on Internet freedom:



Clintons December 29, 2009 response to her staffs first draft of her 2010 internet freedom speech: This looks fine and makes me sound like a techie (which is good, albeit a stretch.)



A January 25, 2010 email from Anne-Marie Slaughter, Clintons top policy advisor in 2010, sharing the news that a Chinese blogger said Clintons speech on internet freedom was like a song to his heart. Clinton replies, That is so gratifying!



Clinton counsel Cheryl Mills forwarding her a September 24, 2010 email from Alec Ross, a top deputy who was working on the Internet freedom agenda, describing the 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria. (Ross also reflects on his and Jared Cohens high-profile trip there in June 2010, writing When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew Syrian society was growing increasingly young...and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential [sic] harness for our purposes.)



Clinton responds to a Roger Cohen New York Times op-ed praising the good works of the U.S. Foreign Service, which had its internal communications exposed by Wikileaks in the fall of 2010, with two words: Not bad.



A November 24, 2010 email from New York Times reporter Scott Shane to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley reading, In view of wires, etc, and not for attribution please, we dont think WL [Wikileaks] is going to dump 250k cables on the web anytime soon. We think they will for now follow guidance of other publications and the initial numbers will be small. But multiple people seem to have the whole collection, so who knows. Crowley forwards the email up the chain, with the comment, Potentially great news.

In theory, what the Corps does is old-fashioned civic tech, in the core sense of using technology for the common good, but as Grunwald points out, not only did 1,800 people die in New Orleans because the Corps flood protection failed, Congress never took steps to reform it after Katrina and the agency remains a prime hub for pork-barrel waste.

EFFs Parker Higgins points out that a big reason Russia backed down on censoring Wikipedia last week over the publication of an article about hashish (which apparently violated the countrys restrictions on content related to drugs) was because the site uses HTTPS encryption.

What political nerds dont get about techies: Since David Roberts long piece in Vox about how smart tech nerds dont get American politics seems to have struck a nerve, let me add a few cents about why Im not enamored of his essay. The core problem is that Roberts makes a blanket statement about tech nerds that he never actually backs up. Tim Urban, the author of the Wait But Why blog, is his sole target, and that for writing a long post about climate change that gets the science right and the politics wrong. From there, Roberts leaps, gazelle-like, to the claim that distaste for government and politics is extremely common in the nerd community and that most tech nerds just think Washington is dysfunctional and both parties are equally to blame. Well, if tech nerds all thought that, then why are so many tech nerds plugged into the Obama administration (and campaign before it)? And why are Democratic campaigns so well stocked with tech nerds while the Republicans struggle to recruit top talent to their side?


(Oh, and as to Roberts claim that there are no independents in American politics, the fact is that when Americans have three viable choices on the ballot (rather than the duopoly), they often vote for the independentjust ask Senators Angus King, Bernie Sanders, Lincoln Chafee or Governors Bill Walker, Lowell Weicker and Jesse Ventura. If Democratic and Republican party identities were so strong, how did these guys all get elected?)

According to Rose Broome, Handups founder, in addition to providing donors with more ways to give, they also help connect homeless people to the citys social service workers. We dont have a unified database of the homeless population in many cities, so every time they show up at a new non-profit or government center, social workers have to do a full intake all over again, she said. ...Some of our really big goals involve not only distributing private money, but also making distributing government benefits more efficient as well.

DNC control means that eventually the partys presidential nominee will get access to the email list Obama built.


Hillary Clintons decision to use a private email server while Secretary of State, and her handling of the issue since it has arisen, has allowed a cloud to settle over her candidacy, according to interviews with more than 75 Democracy governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members done by Patrick Healy, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman for the New York Times. For example, heres Clinton supporter Edward Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania: Theyve handled the email issue poorly, maybe atrociously, certainly horribly. The campaign has been incredibly tone-deaf, not seeing this as a more serious issue. She should have turned over the email server at the start, because they should have known theyd be forced to give it up. But at this point, theres nothing they can do to kill the issuetheyre left just playing defense.


According to a new survey by Adobe, 42 percent of Americans check their email while in the bathroom. Apparently a lot of us would like to have a private email server, too.

The New Yorkers trickling into the basement reference room of the Fort Washington branch library on the Thursday before Independence Day were among the 730,000 New York City households without broadband internet in the homebut not for much longer. After a brief orientation they each walked out with a pocket-size Wi-Fi hotspot, theirs for the next six monthsa full year if they choose to renew. The New York Public Library (NYPL), which serves Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx, first received a $500,000 grant from the Knight News Challenge last year to run a year-long, 10,000-unit hotspot lending program. Since then, the library has received $1 million from Google, with additional support from Open Society Foundations and the Robin Hood Foundation, and has partnered with the Brooklyn and Queens public libraries to expand the program across all five New York boroughs.
Since being made available to the general population, demand for the hotspots has been high: advance registration is required to attend orientations in the NYPL and the Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) systems and slots are said to fill up within a day or two of being announced. Program coordinators in all three systems as well as the New Yorkers lining up to borrow the devices have almost entirely positive things to say about the program, but how the libraries could afford to keep the project going beyond the one-year pilot period is a question nobody can answer yet. It also remains to be seen how the libraries will determine if this program is the best way to leverage limited resources towards closing the digital divide.
The patron response has been really positive, Jesse Montero, the Director of Information Services at BPL, tells Civicist. People are just really excited to get home wireless access. Its really empowering for people. As far as getting measurable outcomes, thats something were all looking forward to through surveys.
Charity Kittler, the Library Hotspot Program Manager at NYPL, tells Civicist that the surveys include questions about patron demographics, device usage, and the lending program itself, but it remains unclear how the results of the survey will be used to determine success.
A Crown Heights orientation leader holds up one of the hotspots. (Civicist)
The hotspot, technically the Sprint Netgear Zing mobile hotspot, is small enough to fit in a pocket and can travel and connect anywhere in the continental U.S. Although data usage is unlimited, the device allows for 6GB of data a month at LTE speeds before getting downgraded to a slower 3G speed. This throttling is put in place to curb excessive usagebasically gaming or streaming videos. Up to nine devices (phones, tablets, or computers) can be connected to the signal at once.
The devices are activated before being shipped to the libraries and so, although the program is described as year-long, the internet could actually stop two to three weeks before the full 12 months are up. Nearly half of the 10,000 devices are already in circulation; the remaining half will be lent out through this fall.
Each library system designed their own programming and lending rules for the hotspots, so when they do start thinking about ways to move forward, they will have three models to compare and contrast.
New York Public Library (Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx)
The NYPL initially began lending the hotspots out last year to participants in the librarys educational programs, like their English or literacy classes, but this April it expanded the program to any individual without home internet service. (Although recipients must sign something that says as much, this is on the honor system.) Patrons can take out the device for six months with the option of one renewal, for a total lending period of a year.
At the July orientation in upper Manhattan, library staff bustled about the basement reference room trying to make sure they let in people on the waiting list in the proper order. Before starting the orientation, one of the women leading it explained to a concerned patron that no, that woman (meaning me) was not cutting the lineshes just a reporter sitting in.
The library staffer handed out user agreements, stapled hotspot information packets, and basic internet safety guides. She delivered the orientation in both English and Spanish, and did her best to answer questions about illegal downloading (Honey, big brother watches everything. Theyll know.) and data quotas.
Charity Kittler tells Civicist that most orientations have between 20 and 30 participants. The advantage of small orientations, she says, is that it allows for a little extra time for patrons to hang around and test out the device on their phone or tablet, and get assistance from library staff if necessary.
Brooklyn Public Library
The BPL is lending the devices out for a full year, but without the option to renew. Like the NYPL program, anyone over the age of 17 is eligible to borrow, as long as they attest they have no home internet access.
There were only five people in the room when I arrived at a Crown Heights orientation in late June, just before the scheduled start time of 11 a.m. The two orientation leaders began the presentation by reading aloud from Powerpoint slides that explained the device and the borrowing rules. Three or four more people trickled in over the next half hour and some of the material had to be repeated.
A quick poll of the room while patrons went one by one to fill out the paperwork and receive their hotspot revealed that most of the attendees had heard about the hotspot program from friends or coworkers.
One woman, who had not registered for the class but had shown up at 8 a.m. hoping to get in off of an unofficial waiting list, said her friend told her it was seventh heaven. Unfortunately, the orientation leaders told me that Brooklyn Public Library policy is to lend only to patrons who have pre-registered for the hotspots, and that the woman would be leavingthat day at leastempty handed.
Queens Library
The Queens Library system modeled their hotspot lending program after their tablet lending program. After Hurricane Sandy, Google donated 5,000 tablets to the Queens Library. Patrons can check out the a tablet for a month, with the possibility of renewing three times. The same terms now apply to the Sprint hotspots.
We decided that we would not make them initially part of a program but lend them out like we do any other material, Kelvin Watson, Vice President of Digital Services and Strategy at Queens Library, tells Civicist.
Until the library began the hotspot lending program, many patrons used the tabletswhich come loaded with a custom library appexclusively offline while at home. Although the app was designed to work online or offline, Watson says being able to get online makes for a richer experience.
What we found was that we could now lend out a tablet and a mobile hotspot to the same patron. That allowed us to couple the devices or decouple the device, Watson adds. Now we ha[ve] an opportunity to come full circle in closing the digital divide, providing both the device and the connection.
Watson has asked his team to pull information about data usage from each device, so that he can show the precise value of the hotspot to library patrons. Data costs money, so this is how we can sayin dollarswhat weve provided to the community, he says.
Queens Library has 2,500 hotspot units to lend. When we spoke in mid-summer, Watson said that total circulation had already passed 4,000 (that includes initial checkouts as well as renewals).
The borrowers
The orientations in Brooklyn and Manhattan were attended by a diverse crowd. Fort Washington, which serves a large Spanish-speaking population, was prepared with print material in both English and Spanish, and the orientation leader was bilingual as well. At the Crown Heights branch, one man told me he came with his friend to help translate the English-language material for him (this man had already received a hotspot of his own and reported being very pleased with it, in spite of speed and data limitations).
Most of the people at the Crown Heights orientation I attended said the device would be used in their single-person households, but two of the women I spoke with at the Fort Washington branch said they had a recent high school graduate at home with whom they would share. Patrons said that they planned to use it to look for work, check email, and to keep in touch with family and friends. One of the orientation leaders said they keep one in their car and use it to listen to Pandora.
The essential reason why I got it was to travel and that way if I hear about a job I can apply right away, one of the women with a teenage son told me. In the past I had to find a Starbucks and now with this hotspot Im a different person. She added that her brother-in-law, a Vietnam veteran, already has one and uses it to keep in touch with Veterans Affairs.
When and if the library systems decide to make the results of the surveys public, we might learn more about the make-up of hotspot users.
BPL set aside a number of devices for special populations, including the elderly and homeless. We look for innovative ways to engage our patrons, Nick Higgins, the Director of Outreach Services, tells Civicist. The people we work with...dont have traditional access to libraries.
As part of their immigrant services, BPL lends the devices to students in their three-month-long citizenship classes so that they can study outside of class.
They also set aside 10 hotspots for older adults. BPL already has an established books by mail program for older adults, who can call and request books to be delivered to them. Higgins says they have reached out to a handful of the 350 registered books-by-mail users to see if they want internet access. If a patron says yes then a library staff member will stop by, set up the hotspot, and show them how to use it. Higgins says all 10 have been deployed. If the patron doesnt have a device to get online (as is common, says Higgins) they will also loan a tablet.
Higgins also told Civicist about a new partnership with the NYC Department of Homeless Services to open outpost libraries in eight family centers in Brooklyn, and his plans to start lending hotspots out of those sites.
One year and counting
Although the first few devices were lent out last December, the last devices have yet to even arrive in the city. This is a one-year pilot program stretched out over two years (or morethere was an even smaller 100-unit pilot in early 2014). Challenges, Im told, are few.
Theres just the small problem of figuring out where to get the next influx of financial support for the program. Kittler told Civicist that NYPL does not expect to get more funding from the same partners. The devices are paid for, but more money will be needed to keep the data flowing, to replace damaged or lost hotspots, and to expand the program.
Other states and cities are dealing with these same issues. Kittler collaborates with libraries in Kansas and Maine that have similar Wi-Fi lending programs (some of their lending periods are as short as two weeks). The Knight Foundation awarded $400,000 to the Chicago Public Library for a hotspot lending program at the same time as the NYPL grant. And a program in Seattle launched earlier this year to astronomically high demand175 holds on 126 devices on the first day of circulation, according to James Risley, who reviewed the device for GeekWire. By the time Risley got his hands on one the waiting list was almost 1,300 people strong.
I havent really talked to another library system that has a long term sustainability solution, the Seattle Public Librarys IT director, Jim Loter, told Risley. Were certainly interested in continuing the program as long as theres high demand for it, and at this point we have a number of options that were exploring in order to do that.
What the best way to tackle the digital divide in New York? I feel like I have this conversation every week, Charity Kittler tells Civicist. There are lots of different ideas being batted about internally.
In the meantime, the hotspot lending program means that, for a lucky few, going online no longer requires signing up to use a library computer a day in advance, lurking on the steps of public libraries after hours, or spending money at a coffee shop or fast food joint just to get a Wi-Fi password. It might not be the always-on, Google-Fiber-fast connection many Americans want or even expect, but, if the sustainability problem is sorted out, hotspot lending programs could be an important part of a connectivity web, bringing underserved populations online, more often.
Full disclosure: Civic Hall co-founder Andrew Rasiej helped conceive and secure funding for this pilot program.

The Spanish-language news media has also been more critical in its coverage of Mr. Trumps positions on the issue, with nearly all of it negative in tone.


Crazy talk? Harvard Law professor and erstwhile single-issue presidential candidate tells Politico Magazines Ben Wofford that he would run with Donald Trump as a third-party ticket. Ill make a promise, Lessig declared. If Trump said he was going to do one thing and fix this corrupted system, then go back to his life as an entertainment figure, I absolutely would link up with Donald Trump. Lessig also says Trumps statements about not being beholden to big money explain his appeal (as opposed to his attacks on immigrants and women). Your reading may vary. (See Evan Osnos New Yorker story on Trumps appeal to racists, for one alternative view.)


Lessig also would make Joe Biden his Vice President and hand the White House over to him once his Citizen Equality Act became law, Emily Greenhouse reports for Bloomberg.


Speaking of money in politics, Bernie Sanders appears to be drawing more support from small donors for his campaign than Barack Obama did in 2008, 75% of it through ActBlue, Eric Lichtblau reports for the New York Times. Unlike nearly all the other candidates, Sanders has also rejected efforts by supporters to set up a Super PAC on his behalf.


TEDXX: GenderAvenger.com founder Gina Glantz makes a sharp point in this Washington Post oped: conferences and media platforms centered on women dont do much for women.

Maybe there should also be a TEDMen and the best of both should be featured at a TEDEverybody.

Less common are Yelp pages for agencies without a public face, such as those that repair potholes, maintain public parks, regulate the timing of streetlights, or repair graffiti in public places. This is likely because these agencies typically dont think of themselves as customer-facing and are less likely to create a venue for online feedback. Wouldnt it be great if government sought out input on the quality of those services, and sought our input on how to improve them?

Future, Imperfect: The United Nations new special rapporteur on privacy, Joseph Cannataci, didnt mince words when talking to The Guardians Adam Alexander. He says things are worse than anything George Orwell foresaw, Because if you look at CCTV alone, at least Winston [Winston Smith in Orwells novel 1984] was able to go out in the countryside and go under a tree and expect there wouldnt be any screen, as it was called. Whereas today there are many parts of the English countryside where there are more cameras than George Orwell could ever have imagined. So the situation in some cases is far worse already.

Access Denials: When did it become OK for a single cable channel to monopolize access to a presidential debate, Susan Crawford asks on Mediums Backchannel? Yet that is exactly what the Fox News Channel did with the first GOP debate earlier this month, with the result that if you didnt have a cable subscription, you couldnt watch. As Crawford correctly notes, There is no speech more central to civic life than a political debate. And yet we have allowed access to that speech by way of the common medium of our erahigh-speed internet accessto be controlled by a cabal of private actors.


This past weekend, Twitter informed the Open State Foundation that it was shutting down its Politwoops sites in 30 countries and its related Diplotwoops service, which monitored deleted tweets by diplomats and embassies. This follows on Twitters equally shameful decision to shut down the Sunlight Foundations Politwoops account tracking US politicians deleted tweets earlier this year. Explaining its decision, Twitter told the Open State Foundation that it believed all its users deserved the ability to safely and privately delete tweets. Arjan El Fassed, the director of the foundation commented: What elected politicians publicly say is a matter of public record. Even when tweets are deleted, its part of parliamentary history. These tweets were once posted and later deleted. What politicians say in public should be available to anyone. This is not about typos but it is a unique insight on how messages from elected politicians can change without notice.


In Wired, Klint Finley reports on how pro-government Twitter bots are disrupting online activism by Mexicos protest movements, drowning out real conversations with noise.


USA Todays Brad Heath reports on how police in Baltimore regularly use phone trackers (aka stingrays, or cell-site simulators) in everyday cases. He writes, Records show that the citys police used stingrays to catch everyone from killers to petty thieves, that the authorities regularly hid or obscured that surveillance once suspects got to court and that many of those they arrested were never prosecuted. State law requires that defense lawyers be told about electronic surveillance, while the FBI has asked police agencies to keep their use confidential.


Food for Thought: The Fall 2014 issue of the World Policy Journal is titled Connectivity, and this article by Egyptian political activist Mahmoud Salem, known on Twitter as @sandmonkey, captures well the upside and downside of connection technologies in revolutionary situations. On the one hand, he notes, a Twitter account called Tahrir Suppliescreated by two girls forbidden by their parents from attending the street protestscollected $700K in medical supplies in one day. On the other hand, he writes:

A revolution organized by social media is by definition a revolution made up of disparate individuals who share similar but general goals. When it came to details, however, the devil lay there smiling. Ideological disagreements reared their ugly heads. Political divisions cracked the collective. Shrillness and extremism quickly replaced rational discourse among even the most renowned activists, who had been allies for years.

Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood runs a summer fellowship program thats not the usual summer accelerator fare: the competitive program accepts top talent to work on big problems that are affecting low-income communities and gets fellows out into the communities theyre designing for to make better products. Blue Ridge pushes its impressive fellows to work cheaply, rapidly, and closely with its costumers at every step in the process. This work is enabled in part by the labs Design Insight Group, which conducts user testing and seeks input on product design from New York City residents. Blue Ridges summer fellowship is in its second year, with four of the five 2014 products (which we wrote up last year as well) still in operation.
Last night at Civic Hall, the 2015 fellows demoed their work for a full house. The criteria that the audience and judges were asked to vote on were:
Impact: Does this address a real pain point faced by New Yorkers?
Validation: Is this something people want and need?
Feasibility: Is this a approach realistic and likely to be effective?
All of the products presented were beautifully designed and well-thought out, but the unanimous winner, as picked by the judges, was JustFix.nyc. More on JustFix and all of the products below.
JustFix.nyc
Dan Kass, Georges Clement, Lucas Carlisle
JustFix.nyc is a tool to empower tenants to get repairs made on their apartments. The team explained that more than 35% of NYC public housing residents live in deficient housing that may require frequent repairs. However, complex legal conditions and scattered city services make it difficult to seek help when landlords are negligent or unresponsive. JustFix is based on the idea that, in order to get repairs on your apartment made, you need to build your case. The JustFix app guides you through doing an inspection on your apartment, tracks your progress and communication, and collects photo evidence. The app automates complex processes like drafting a letter of complaint and finding the proper city services. JustFix then lets you share your case with caseworkers and lawyers if you need to go to court. JustFix already helped two beta testers win their legal cases, with one judge commenting that the JustFix user was more qualified than her landlords entire legal team combined.
DucklingLindsey Wagner, Alex Hunsucker, Fred Diego
Duckling is a platform that provides little loans to college students who need them through peer-to-peer lending circles. Duckling is responding to the problem that few students are prepared for the full cost of college, and a gap exists between the true cost of living at school and what many students can actually pay. Its founders explained that most students have few options to cover those extra costs: high interest credit cards, payday loans, or missing class to pick up an extra job. As a result, over half of dropouts in community colleges are due to financial pressure. Duckling creates a mobile platform to establish lending circles among college students. It matches students who need cash now and will pay a small fee with students who are able to save longer and want a larger payoff. Friendly texts and built-in orientation makes it easy to understand, join, and manage payments. Duckling wants to help students with immediate costs now prepare for a healthier financial future.
GrapevineSusie Kavanaugh, Nikhil Murthy, Ashley Treni
Grapevine seeks to make finding educational community resources take minutes, not hours. Its teams research found that websites that centralize educational resources arent mobile friendly and dont organize information efficiently, causing parents to click through many, many pages to figure out whether a program is right for their child. Grapevine lets users search for local resources and filter by the categories that are actually relevant to themage of child, time of day, cost, etc.and allows users to text programs that they find to their friends or share them on Facebook. Filters were created based on their research of parents actual search patterns. The Grapevine team populated the educational resources in Brownsville as a test case, and has plans to extend not only the geography of the app, but also the scope of resources into career opportunities and social services.
Nova JobsAmer Fitian, Judy Siegel, Alexei Magiakov
Nova is a platform that creates a two way marketplace for laborers in the food service industry. Available in English and Spanish, Nova helps food servers, bussers, line cooks and other food service workers looking for employment connect with restaurant managers who need to fill open shifts. Its founders explained that there are over 44,000 food services facilities in NYC alone, but certain kinds of restaurants have trouble finding replacements for open shifts when people call in sick or schedules change. In Nova, a server, line cook, bus boy, or other food service professional fills out a profile about their skills and ability and the app generates an anonymous resume. (Its anonymous in order to reduce discrimination.) Restaurant managers are then able to search through profiles of food service professionals to find someone with the right qualifications, availability, and good ratings. Users can rate one another and choose open shifts and employees based on skills and the in-app review platform.
PopulaceSam Gimbel, Dylan Butman, Joel Stillman
Populace is an SMS-based communication platform thats helping community programs get the right information to the right people at the right time. Populaces founders say that its easy to find programs online, but a lack of effective communication channels between community organizers who run programs and the people who want to take them prevent people from actually registering for programs on time: registration times dont line up, people see the flyers too late, you sign up on the web and forget about it later, etc. Populace provides a platform for interested people to sign up via text and then receive timely information and reminders from the program managers. As people text Populace, organizers get live updates on how many people are interested or have registered and allows organizers to manage waitlists and alumni through the same SMS platform. Populace has wide applicability: after school counselors, immigration advocates, community boards, shift managers, and many more may see ways to use it. Populace is already doing several pilot programs with various NYC community organizations and is planning a larger public launch in Q1 2016.

Tech and the presidentials: Must-read: How Bernie Sanders supporters around the country are organizing themselves, frequently in advance of the campaign or with limited help from it, using Reddit, Facebook and clipboards, as reported by Ben Schreckinger for Politico.


One key Sanders supporter is Aidin King, a 23-year-old winery employee who administers the Bernie Sanders for President subreddit, which has 90,000 subscribers. (Notably, the Sanders campaign has made no moves to take over the Reddit pagethose of you with long memories will recall how the Obama campaigns online organizing team took over a supporters grassroots MySpace page back in 2007. One of the people responsible for that decision, Chris Hughes, is now the owner of The New Republic. The other one, Scott Goodstein, is working for the Sanders campaign.)


Related: On Facebook, Zack Exley shares that he joined the Bernie Sanders campaign six weeks ago, where he says hes doing the massively-scaled movement organizing work that Ive been dreaming about, and only scratching the surface of, for two decades. Exley was director of online communications and organizing on John Kerrys 2004 presidential campaign, and also co-founded and was the president of the New Organizing Institute.


Interviewed for a Time magazine cover story, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump (who is also self-organizing his campaign) says he would get rid of the artificial separation between Super PACs and candidates, arguing Now youre not supposed to talk, youre not supposed to  they go out and play golf, they get together, but they dont talk. Who believes that? So I want transparency. I dont mind the money coming in. Let it be transparent. Let them talk, but let there be total transparency.


Paging Larry Lessig: Trump also says this about Members of Congress and campaign finance:
All they do it fundraise. They dont really govern. They just fundraise. Their whole life is raising money. And I say what percentage of the time youre raising money as opposed to legislating? ...I mean theyre constantly  its that time of year, you come in. I mean thats all they do is raise money....Its the rare politician that can do whats right in the face of massive contributions.


And in a comment that is sure to interest companies like Apple, which have billions in profits parked overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes, Trump says, We should let them back in. Everybody. Even if you paid nothing it would be a good deal. Because theyll take that money then and use it for other things.


GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush says hes against encryption, reports Jenna McLaughlin for The Intercept. This is kind of like saying you are against math. The actual quote, from a South Carolina event sponsored by Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security, was If you create encryption, it makes it harder for the American government to do its job  while protecting civil liberties  to make sure that evildoers arent in our midst.


The New Yorkers Jeffrey Toobin makes a really good point about the latest twist in the Hillary Clinton email server brouhaha: the post-facto discovery that some of her emails might have contained classified information is largely meaningless, because government bureaucrats routinely classify far too much information and often do so for reasons have little to do with actual national security. And, as he notes, Criminal violations for mishandling classified information all have intent requirements; in other words, in order to be guilty of a crime, there must be evidence that Clinton knew that the information was classified and intentionally disclosed it to an unauthorized person. There is no evidence she did anything like that. This is not now a criminal matter, and there is no realistic possibility it will turn into one.


Future, Imperfect: Cosmopolitans Jill Filipovic reports on how Twitchy, a conservative online platform founding by rightwing blogger Michelle Malkin that monitors Twitter, has become an organized harassment tool. The site, which Malkin sold to Salem Media, gets 2 million unique visitors a month. She notes that Twitchys terms of use disallow content that is fraudulent, unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit or indecent, but those terms dont seem to be enforced.

Tech and the Presidentials: Just as the Obama campaign collected the mobile phone numbers of tens of thousands of supporters attending his mass rallies, candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are looking to the text message channel as the best way to communicate with their core supporters, Nick Corasaniti reports for The New York Times.


Politicos Annie Karni reports on concerns among Clinton allies that her response to the ongoing questions about her private email server is too legalistic.


Wondering why Donald Trump is doing so well in Republican primary polling? Political scientist Lee Drutman argues in Vox that its because hes in tune with a sizable chunk of the public: populists who want to reduce immigration AND protect Social Security, who may be as many as 40% of the overall electorate. What holds these two positions together is a turning inward mood led by Americans fearful that their middle class standard of living is disappearing. (Republican business elites who favor cutting Social Security while taking a more liberal view of immigration are deeply out of touch with their partys base, he adds.)


If you subtract Trumps demagoguery on immigration from the picture, hes somewhat more moderate than most of the other Republican contenders, Josh Barro argues for The Upshot. He cites Trumps statements and positions on taxes (he hasnt signed Grover Norquists pledge to never raise them) abortion (he favors allowing it in cases of rape or incest), and trade (hes not a free trader) as example.


My view: If Trump starts talking up his call to eliminate the inheritance tax in exchange for a one-time mega-tax on the mega-rich (14.25% on individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more), which he made in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve [h/t to Daily News columnist Errol Louis for the long memory], and keeps talking about how all the other top GOP candidates are too beholden to their billionaire Super PAC backers to call for anything similar, he could take the Republican base away from the party establishment entirely and win the GOP nomination. And if he fails at that goal, the Commission on Presidential Debates will be hard pressed to exclude him from the general election debates if he runs as an independent, since hes highly likely to be above 15% in the polls if he keeps campaigning.


All of the software that Lawrence Lessigs 2016 presidential campaign makes will be released under the GPL 3.0 open-source licence [sic], and all creative materials will be released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 licence [sic], his exploratory committee announced. We have no idea why his organisation is honouring Her Majestys English.


Ross Choma reminds us in Mother Jones that most online political advertising is essentially unregulated compared to TV or print ads, where the names of the organization paying for them have to be disclosed.


Future, Imperfect: Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at Stanford Law Schools Center for Internet and Society, gave a powerful keynote at the Black Hat 2015 conference earlier this month. Shes posted a modified version of her talk on Medium, entitled The end of the Internet dream. She warns: For better or for worse, weve prioritized things like security, online civility, user interface, and intellectual property interests above freedom and openness. The Internet is less open and more centralized. Its more regulated. And increasingly its less global, and more divided. These trends: centralization, regulation, and globalization are accelerating. And they will define the future of our communications network, unless something dramatic changes. (h/t David Isenberg)

Heres the video of Hillary Clintons August 11 meeting with five #BlackLivesMatter activists in New Hampshire last week, posted by GOOD Magazines Gabriel Reilich. The activists press Clinton on her support for the massive increase in tough on crime measures in the 1990s, championed by her husband while he was President. Interestingly, Clinton appears to admit that she is a sinner in the context of the rise of mass incarceration of black people. As MSNBCs Ari Melber tweeted, Candor & tension in Clinton-#BlackLivesMatter mtg shows why citizen Qs for pols are powerful.

Live callers hear traditional ringing during this process.

You can also enter your typical electric bill amount to customize the results. The tool then combines all this information to estimate the amount you could potentially save with solar panels, and it can help connect you with local solar providers.

Brazil's Transparency Hacker collective with their "Transparency Bus" circa 2012

The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking over the subversive ones.
 The Hacker Hacked, by Brett Scott

Ever since I read Brett Scotts engrossing piece on what he refers to as the gentrification of hacker culture Ive been thinking about how this idea might apply to the world of civic hacking. The lament about the loss of the subversive nature of hacking resonatesScott repeatedly uses this word in describing the origins of hacking and its focus on being antiestablishment and decentralized.
Civic hacking became popular in the last several years via municipal app contests like Apps for Democracy and NYC Big Apps, and then by community-focused events organized by local groups. Often these local events have benefitedand continue to benefitfrom the direct participation of local governments and other government entities.
Back in 2011, one of the first civic hacking events I helped organize in Philadelphia was focused on transit data, and the event ultimately included the participation of the local transit authority. I even talked about the benefit of having representatives from the transit authority on hand at the event in subsequent interviews.
Participation in civic hacking events by government employees is something I helped to advocate for after I joined the City of Philadelphia as Chief Data Officer. I regularly attended civic hacking meetups and weekend hackathons, and encouraged others in city government to do so as well. Id say its pretty common now in most cities with a developed civic hacking community to have regular, visible representation from government at civic hacking events.
But civic hacking did not always have such a cozy relationship with government.
Many early civic hacking projects grew out of frustration with the quality of public services and the lack of available data from governments. One of the earliest civic hacking projects in the Philadelphia areawhich helped to inspire the transit hackathon I would later organizewas born out of frustration over the lack of easy-to-access transit schedule data from the regional transportation authority.
These early civic hacking projects often used FOIA requests or web scrapers to obtain data that governments were reluctant to open up, and some even drew the ire of the government lawyers.
The subversive nature of civic hacking continues to this day through the work of people like Carl Malamud and others. It would be unwise to forget the many institutional barriers that still exist to releasing open data from government, and collaborating effectively with outside parties.
A little subversion is still necessary.
There is much to be gained by building bridges between the world of civic hacking and government. There is a long history of volunteerism to help government in this country, of which civic hacking can be viewed as a contemporary extension. Engaged civic hackers can help build solutions that help governments deliver services more effectively, and increasingly the civic hacking community has been looked at as fertile ground for recruiting new government employees.
But is there a risk that the civic hacking community will become gentrified? Has it already become so?
Do civic hacking groups that work regularly and closely with government officials feel empowered to ask tough, direct (often uncomfortable) questions about data releases and procurement practices? Do groups that collaborate regularly with government feel that they have standing to hold public officials feet to the fire when needed?
How do we balance the relationship between civic hackers and governments in a way that can realize the potential benefits of government as a platform and that is also true to the subversive roots of civic hacking?
I dont have the answers, but I hope others are open to having this discussion.

The Future of Work? In case you missed it, Amazon is a pretty hyper-competitive place to work, according to Jodi Kantor and David Streitfelds long investigative piece for Sundays New York Times.

Twitter. Facebook. SEO. The so-called digital divide. Everything covered during the six-week, 100-hour Roy Clay Sr. Workshop is an opportunity for political discussion. Run by the St. Louis-area activist collective Hands Up United, the workshop teaches area residents between the ages 16 and 30 how to code, and they put their new skills to use by building websites for black-owned area businesses and nonprofits.
There are plenty of programs that have set their sights on diversifying the technology industryGirls Who Code, Black Girls Code, Telegraph Academybut the Tech Impact initiative is arguably even more ambitious. Alongside instruction on HTML and JavaScript, participants in the Roy Clay Sr. workshopnamed for a Ferguson-area man who became a prominent black entrepreneur and engineer in Silicon Valleyreceive a political education.
Were creating tech-savvy, conscious leaders, who so happen to be radical black and brown youth, Idalin Abby Bobe, a volunteer with the initiative, tells Civicist.
Tara Thompson, a director at Hands Up United and point person on the Tech Impact initiative, concurs. Changing the ratio is obviously important, she tells Civicist, referring to programs that focus on diversifying the tech industry, but if youre changing the ratio solely to change the numbers and not to to have a greater impact, I wonder how effective that is.
The workshop meets three times a week: from 5pm  9pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on Saturdays from 10am  6pm. But Bobe says that sometimes participants will hang around for a couple extra hours on Saturdays. Instruction is provided by mentors, mostly from the technology sector in St. Louis, who donate their time and energy to the program.
Hands Up United was inspired to start this program last year during Ferguson October, when local activists called for a boycott of major corporations in the area. Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that many St. Louis area residents were unaware of locally-owned alternatives in their community because they had no web presence. A problem with a relatively simple solution had presented itself, and Hands Up United created a program to tackle it.
The workshop empowers students with new knowledge and skills, and it helps support local businesses.
Lastly and perhaps most importantly, its about building community, says Thompson. I impress on them every day that there is no honor in being the best coder in this class if there is someone who is struggling.
Participants are expected to stay connected after graduation. They need to keep in touch with the businesses they helped, in case the owners have problems with the website. And, according to Thompson, at least three students from the first cohort have come back to help mentor the second.
At graduation, participants receive a $500 stipend and a laptop valued at $700. (Thompson says that of the 12 participants preparing to graduate on Sunday, only two have access to a personal computer outside of class.) The program also feeds the students every day they hold workshop, a not-insignificant expense.
Thompson says the biggest hurdle is always money. The first workshop, held in February, was crowdfunded last November. Hands Up United launched another crowdfunding campaign last week to raise enough money to cover stipends and laptops this Sunday. ThoughtWorks, the consulting firm (and Abby Bobes employer), will match the funds up to $15,000.
We have a lot of work to do, Thompson says towards the end of the interview. I mean society as a whole...if you care at all about these issues and really just as a human I encourage you to get engaged.
She points out that protest is not all standing in the street, facing off with the police. Theres a way for everyone to plug in if you care about other humans.

Everyone knows that Silicon Valley has made over San Francisco in its techno-utopian image, but Brett Scott writes in aeon that another victim of gentrification is the intangible thing one might called the hacker ethos:
The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking over the subversive ones.
    Although he focuses mostly on the debasement of hacker values for profit, its impossible not to also think of the state or business-sponsored hackathon, which focuses the techno-activists energy on sanctioned solutions to societys problems. However, hacker cultureunlike the physical spaces we normally think of when we say gentrificationis not a zero-sum game. While the language of the hacker might have been co-opted for profit, the true hacker spirit (whatever that may be) is still out there. As Scott writes:
Its in the emergent forms of peer production and DIY culture, in maker-spaces and urban farms. We see it in the expansion of open scenes, from open hardware to open biotech, and in the intrigue around 3D printers as a way to extend open-source designs into the realm of manufacture.

Clay describes the book as basically a manifesto for people to really embrace their own inner misfit, their rogue or their counter-cultural personality. Hacking is featured prominently.

Yesterday was the anniversary of Michael Browns death in Ferguson, Missouri. In an op-ed for The Guardian, activist and organizer DeRay McKesson recalls the importance of Twitter and Instagram to the Movement for Black Lives:
If not for Twitter and Instagram, Missouri officials would have convinced you, one year ago, that we simply did not exist. Or that we were the aggressors, rather than the victims. That we, and not they, were the violent ones.
    But social media was our weapon against erasure. It is how many of us first became aware of the protests and how we learned where to go, or what to do when teargassed, or who to trust. We were able to both counter the narrative being spun by officials while connecting with each other in unprecedented ways. Many of us became friends digitally, first. And then we, the protestors, met in person.


After a day of protests, an 18-year-old man named Tyrone Harris was shot by police in Ferguson and is now in critical condition, Lisa Brown and Tim Bryant report for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. An activist and protestor named Tony Rice, who filmed the aftermath of the shooting, was arrested shortly after for refusing to move back, Jon Swaine reports for The Guardian.

Tonight, Facebook and Fox News will again let the public pose questions to the presidential hopefuls. As in the 2008 YouTube debates, the public can post a video question to the Fox News Facebook page.

Just a coffee shop for some; a lifeline for others. (Anthony92931, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons)

This article was co-written with Julia Ticona.
Mike was 15 minutes late for an interview and not answering texts or phone calls. Julia was just about ready to write him off when he burst through the door of the Dunkin Donuts where they had agreed to meet, full of apologies. He sat down and as he put his phone on the table it began beeping and vibrating. Mike said that after spending over $100the equivalent of 10 hours payon a new phone that had ended up in a snowbank, he was forced to purchase yet another phone. Because of the extra cost, however, he wasnt able to keep up with payments to the phone company. Julia was confused. If his phone service was disconnected, why was it buzzing with notifications? Mike explained that he was using a free app to make and receive calls with the free wifi he accessed at fast food joints around the city, including this Dunkin Donuts.
Mike has two part-time jobs, one in a medical supplies warehouse, and another as a day laborer for a home repairs business, both of which require him to commute for over an hour from where he lives in Maryland. For both jobs, his bosses call to check his availability, often only a few hours in advance. With his lack of consistent phone service this poses a logistical challenge and has led to his habit of spending days off hanging out at local restaurants with free wifi. Hell head to the McDonalds down the street from his house to make calls and check Craigslist to find work. The patchwork of part-time work and low-paid gigs that Mike relies on for his income is increasingly common for high school-educated minorities.
Every day, Mike engages in what Julia calls the digital hustle: finding and securing this work requires participation in online networks and the ability to make and receive phone calls. His inability to maintain enough income to foot the bill for cell phone service every month has created a constraint that required him to find other resources.
By many measures, someone like Mike might be considered unconnected to the internet. He has no internet or computer at home, and though he has a smartphone, he has no data or phone plan. And yet his very ability to sustain his livelihood depends on his ability to find and maintain connectivity, using apps and free wifi networks that create the phone connection he needs.
~~~
New policies aiming to bring greater connectivity to people in low-income urban and rural areas have garnered political support as more public attention is drawn to closing the digital divide in the United States. This includes ConnectHome, a recently-announced White House initiative that plans to connect 275,000 homes with free or low-cost broadband access, with the goal of complementing ConnectEd, which brings universal broadband to schools. In addition, the FCC is advocating an expansion of the Lifeline program, which currently provides subsidies for landline and mobile phone access, to give recipients of this subsidy the opportunity to choose to spend their $9.25 per month to defray the costs of either broadband, landline, or mobile phone plans.
The digital divide, as explored in a recent White House report, often correlates with existing inequalities:
The benefits of this technological revolution, however, have not been evenly distributed. Millions of Americans still do not regularly use a computer, and research shows that there remain substantial disparities in both internet use and the quality of access. This digital divide is concentrated among older, less educated, and less affluent populations, as well as in rural parts of the country that tend to have fewer choices and slower connections.

The paper notes that the digital divide can be measured along a number of axesability to access broadband internet at home (whether landline or wireless), quality of said access, and diversity of broadband offerings. And due to the technological and infrastructural requirements of providing broadband vis-a-vis a lack of alternative options, rural areas often experience especially pronounced effects.
Unfortunately, however, due to the enormous logistical costs, there are 55 million people in the United States without broadband access; expanding broadband to 275,000 of them will barely put a dent, as Micah Sifry wrote recently. Neither ConnectHome nor the new Lifeline program address the considerable costs of ensuring sustainable maintenance, which may be a larger barrier to low-income people fully engaging online. The enormous logistical efforts of providing such access means that that goal may be many years off. Importantly, these efforts also assume a largely stable, singular primary residence, which isnt the reality for many low-income families, who face rising rates of housing insecurity.
The implicit logic behind these plans, and much rhetoric surrounding the digital divide, is a basic connectivity binary: between an urban, middle-class vision of always-on broadband access in a stable home and, by contrast, a complete lack of connectivity. Even accounting for the nuance of the White House report, which measures the digital divide in a number of different ways, popular thinking largely focuses on one mode: broadband at home. Many other forms for access such as Mikes, above, are rendered invisible.
While the goal to connect all citizens via broadband is a critical one, limiting ourselves to binary thinking about connectivity can have unintended consequences. Policy and outreach efforts run the risk of ignoring the many vital ways people already access the web and its products in the United States, while civic-oriented websites and apps may not be optimized for modes of access that are more diverse than simply always-on mobile and desktop. As the federal government and corporations work steadily to open up broadband access to all, other modes of access may be readily available at lower cost and faster implementation, with a potentially high impact in the short term.
~~~
What can more diversified thinking about connectivity look like? Our goal here is not to argue for specific policy changes and technological methods, but instead to argue for a seeing connectivity as more of a spectrum than a binary.
Consider an extreme example outside the United States: in recent years, Cubans have had little to no access to the internet, with an elite 5 percent of the countrys 11 million people having private internet connections. Nevertheless, many Cubans have found different ways to access popular internet content thanks to distributed USB sticks in a sneakernet-based system. El Paquete Semanal (The Weekly Package), a popular sneakernet magazine, directly services 10-20 people per day, and those people in turn make copies for friends and family. As An has written previously, this sort of access extends to North Korea and northern Uganda, and almost certainly to other parts of the world where the infrastructure for any form of wired or wireless internet access is almost nonexistent.
In the United States, we might consider looking at Connect 4 Lifes project to give smartphones to homeless LGBTQ teens. These teens are overrepresented among the homeless youth population in the U.S. and programs like this aim to give them access to the tools necessary to contact caseworkers, find friendly shelters and meal programs, and look for work. These teens, for whom connectivity is essential to avoiding involvement with criminal activities, finding help, and eventually getting into more stable housing, would be untouched by efforts to expand home-based broadband access.
These examples point at different ways to broaden our thinking about infrastructure, but software developers can also play an important role in ensure websites and apps can support individuals with a variety of different types of connectivity. Take, for instance, the simple affordances of Instapaper and Pocket, apps that allow for offline reading of popular articles. How else can we provide queued, offline access for those who might only have intermittent access at libraries, cafes, and fast food restaurants? Can content be more readily downloadable, El Paquete-style, to USB sticks and mobile phones, for consumption at home?
Consider as well that many civic technology sites are oriented to web access and/or phone services. The Lifeline program in the United States currently offers phone plan subsidies, and while voicemail-based services can be important, SMS in certain contexts may be more cost effective and preferred. The most popular example of SMS-based systems in this country are probably for telling bus arrival times, but could developers learn from SMS-based systems such as those explored by Twitter, Google, and UNICEF in the developing world?
~~~
To be clear, the initiatives weve described above cannot and should not be seen as replacements for full broadband, networked access at home and on the go. As President Obama is quoted in the White House paper, Today high speed broadband is not a luxury, its a necessity. Advocating for the expansion of Lifeline to support broadband, Van Jones noted the same:
What about a life without broadband Internet?
It would mean: no emails; no ability to quickly look up health information for managing your diabetes or helping your sick child; no way to pay bills, search for jobs, or take classes online.
When you stop to think about it, one thing becomes clear: access to fast and reliable broadband is just as essential now as electricity was during the last century.

As weve seen in recent years, the internet has played a major role in a broad range of major social and political changes, from the #BlackLivesMatter movement to the digitization of our healthcare system. Home and mobile broadband access has allowed the authors of this article to collaborate remotely, share research and disseminate this article efficiently and effectively. What is currently a mark of privilege should be available to all U.S. residents.
Broadening how we think about access can mean assembling a more diverse toolkit of connectivity that is more cost effective and quicker to implement in the short term. Whether thats through sneakernet-driven networks, citywide wifi, distributed smartphones, SMS-based communications or many other modes and methods of connectivity, we should aim to provide a wider range of individuals access to the internet, an absolute necessity for 21st century livelihoods and citizenship.

Digital Divide 







Last month, the City Council in Provo, Utah, voted unanimously to continue the Provo Peoples Lobby, an experimental process in participatory democracy in which city residents collaborate online on a policy recommendation that is then submitted to the City Council for consideration and possible implementation. The process, which I first wrote about in March for techPresident, is run entirely online using NationBuilder and Loomio.
Participants in Provos first Peoples Lobby were selected at random from a pool of approximately 75 people who submitted or voted on the pressing issues they want addressed in their city. Invitations were sent to one person from each of the 25 neighborhoods represented in that pool; ultimately 14 residents participated in the deliberations on the decision-making platform Loomio. Their efforts were guided with minimal moderation from Peoples Lobby creator Jeff Swift, Loomio consultant MJ Kaplan, and two political science students at Brigham Young University.
Recruitment, Swift and his fellow moderators write in a report on the Provo Peoples Lobby, required a lot of handholding via email and phone calls to get people on board:
Future efforts will benefit from seeing the results of the first, and we have learned what information is important to transmit at this stage to ensure that participants will understand what they are signing up for and be ready to participate. We also anticipate that there will be a certain level of drop off no matter what we do, and this is acceptable. We are recruiting a small jury of residents and do not need a fully representative body in order for the Lobby to work as designed.

Originally slated to last two weeks, the process had to be extended to four because both stages took longer than Swift anticipated. First, participants were provided with the list of pressing issues collected in the month prior and instructed to choose an area to focus on; then, they deliberated over the specific recommendations they wanted to make to the Council.
They spent almost two weeks picking a topic; [the process was] extended another two weeks for a total of four, and they still barely had time to craft policy recommendations, Swift tells Civicist. It was at the very end of the second two weeks where they were able to agree on a final proposal.
I think I didnt anticipate how difficult it would be to settle on a topic, Swift adds.
At the end of the four weeks, after five discussions consisting of 205 comments by the participants, three priorities for supporting agriculture and public green spaces in their community were submitted to the City Council. Jeff Swift says he was at first disappointed in these policy particular recommendations because it turns out that these initiatives were already on the City Councils agenda in some form.

I would have wanted something exciting, Swift tells Civicist.
Comment made during the first Provo Peoples Lobby. (Screenshot courtesy Provo Peoples Lobby)
But thats the inherent danger in creating democratic processes: making space for people to push for initiatives one thinks are unnecessary (one of the original suggestions submitted by the public in the earliest stage of the Lobby asked for a big box store in Provo, a proposal Swift was relieved they didnt pursue) or flat out disagree with. I have political opinions and theres a good chance that the Peoples Lobby will go in the other direction [in future iterations], and thats ok, Swift says.
What the results do show, Swift points out, is that either the City Council is acting on their agricultural agenda but not sharing their progress with the community, or that they have stalled on their work in that area. Hal Miller, a Councilman and the liaison with the Lobby, tells Civicist that the results were received as a sort of endorsement of the work of the Council, and that these items have been pushed higher on the Councils agenda.
Swift says he is working on changing the mechanisms of the Lobby to prevent this kind of redundancy in the future. It is one of many small changes Swift will make after the Peoples Lobby inaugural run. To start, the process will be allotted more time from the beginning.
Not every resident will have deep knowledge of all or even most issues the Lobby might tackle. (Screenshot courtesy Provo Peoples Lobby)
Then, he will also increase the guidance by the moderators. Swifts instinct was for them to be as hands off as possible, but that ultimately led to a handful of voicesmany of which belonged to current or potential political actors in the communityessentially intimidating less politically experienced participants out of the process. One way Swift hopes they can change this is by beginning the Lobby by meetingagain, still entirely onlinein small groups where people are hopefully more likely to feel comfortable voicing their opinions. The small groups will then take their ideas to the others.
Were going to be more conscious about keeping the conversation moving forward, Swift says.
Although the numbers in the report on the Provo Peoples Lobby are low, Hal Miller and Jeff Swift are both optimistic. Miller points out that Utah, and Provo in particular, suffers from low voter turnout. While a process like the Peoples Lobby has the potential to increase civic engagement, it also means there is a steep learning curve as residents find out what it means to be civically engaged.

It exceeded my expectations, Miller tells Civicist. I thought there would be more difficulty composing the lobby, more difficulty to bring them together in an ongoing way, and that it would prove difficult to harness the respective energies of the members of the lobby given that it included members who are well known for their activism.
Swift and the other moderators were pleased with the results considering how foreign an idea the Lobby is:
Considering three facts, this level of engagement was heartening. First, this was the very first time anyone in the world had tried this process. It was frankly a bit confusing to understand and we have gotten better about explaining it. Second, we started with an email list of zero people and grew our list to 90 people. This foundation will magnify our efforts for future efforts. And finally, that marketing was limited to Karen Tapahes [Community Relations Coordinator for the City Council] tireless promotion on Facebook and to PR channels. In the future the Peoples Lobby team will do more marketing and promotion to get the word out.

A second experimental round of Provo Peoples Lobby will begin in September. After that, the Council will have to decide whether to incorporate the process into their budget. The cost of the first two rounds were covered by an anonymous donation.

Tech and the presidentials: Heres Donald Trumps self-referential question to his fellow Republican presidential contenders, as posted in response to Facebooks call for questions for the candidates appearing in the first GOP debate this Thursday. If you look closely, youll see that the article he has printed out on his desk for reading is headlined, Donald Trump Winning Facebook by a Landslide.


This headline has more cliches per word than most: Exclusive: Republicans Launch Game-Changing Data Center That Will Forever Change Politics. The story, by Mark Fidelman in Forbes.com, isnt a scoop since people have been reporting on the GOPs Data Center for years. But it does share some new data about whats in Data Center, including the number of people in the national voter file that theyve matched with email addresses (22 million) and the number of micro targeting data points theyve amassed (7.7 billion).


Cryptowars, continued: Longtime British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, author of much of the best reporting on Britains secret surveillance programs going back decades, reflects in The Intercept on how Edward Snowdens disclosures have not only affirmed his earlier work, but also how the debate over rampant government eavesdropping has finally shifted.


While the German authorities have backed off their threat to investigate two journalists who write for Netzpolitik.org, the countrys leading political and digital rights blog, people there are still angry that they were threatened with a treason charge for publishing reports on domestic surveillance, Melissa Eddy reports for the New York Times.


Government opening: Mike Bracken, the pathbreaking director of digital for the U.K. governments Cabinet Office, has announced that hes stepping down after five years in that position.


As Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka blogs, Brackens impact on digital government was transformative. Not only did he lead a massive overhaul of service delivery in the U.K., his work inspired her and other counterparts in the United States and led directly to the launch of the U.S. Digital Service. As Pahlka writes, Now, a pilgrimage to the GDS that Mike and his team have built has become a rite of passage (and a shot of energy and inspiration) for every serious digital government reformer in city, state, and federal government in the U.S. and around the world. Each of us is hoping to learn from and borrow Mikes model and capture even a fraction of the teams success.


Everything Pahlka says about Brackens influence is true (and this great talk by him at PDF 2014 showcases his thinking). Id like to add one more personal comment, about his courage. When the gifted young coder and democracy activist Aaron Swartz took his life in January 2013, suffering under intense pressure from an over-zealous government prosecutor who thought his copying of academic journal articles was some kind of horrific crime, Bracken posted an eloquent tribute to Swartz (and an equally skilled British hacker, Chris Lightfoot, who was a pioneer of e-democracy at mySociety), titled Standing on the shoulders of giants, on Government Digital Services official blog. To my knowledge, not a single one of Brackens counterparts in the U.S. federal branch who work on open government did anything equivalent to mourn Swartzs untimely death.

Last year, a civic tech start-up in Brazil called Nucleo Digital (Digital Core) translated the U.S. Digital Services Playbook into Portuguese and began trying to distribute it to elected representatives and government agencies. Recently, through a colleague in a civic hacking community called HackersBR, they have succeeded in getting the playbook in front of a government administrator in Ceara, Brazils eighth most populous state.
Digital Core first began working together as a digital lab in Sao Paulos City Hall. In 2013, the Urban Development Secretariat Chief Officer, Weber Sutti, invited Vini Russo, Digital Cores CEO, to build a digital platform to support citizen participation in the review and revision of the Department of Urban Developments Master Plan. To build his team, Russo reached out to activists he had known and worked with since 2008, all of whom had an interest in civic tech and updating democracy through technology.
The website they went on to build made available all the information related to the participatory process, such as schedules, results, news, and files...[as well as] innovative participatory tools, such as an online proposal form, a shared map and a collaborative draft bill, where any citizen could post specific comments and suggestions for each article. The city of Sao Paulos website states that the platform made possible unprecedented levels of citizen participation.
We made it very fast, says Maria Shirts, who helps with public relations and project management at Digital Core. With free software and open codes. We like to say that we hacked City Hall. In a legal way.
After the successful implementation of the urban policy platform, the team stayed on at City Hall to build digital tools for other government agencies, facing considerable opposition in their quest to made government more open and transparent. The City Hall, and our government in general, is very closed to new digital initiatives, Shirts tells Civicist. Two years ago it was very taboo [to share code on Github, for example]. We kind of changed this thinking.
Shirts says that her team was at City Hall for more than a year, and that they were starting to change the culture around technology. But in late 2014, Shirts says, the data agency [PRODAM] began kind of a conflict with us because they have another kind of thinking. According to Shirts, the agency refused to give her team the data they needed to build their platforms, so they began to think about leaving City Hall.
It was at that time, September 2014, that the team translated the U.S. Digital Services Digital Playbook:
It was our last month in city hall. We were already thinking that we were leaving, thinking how can we leave city hall but also keep doing this job of opening government. We had a horizon but we were not sure where this horizon was going to take us...At the time we could think [only] about spreading this digital word in other sectors, for other parties, other candidates.

The presidential election took place that month. We were trying to show politicians that they should follow some kind of digital guidelines, Shirts says.
The U.S. Digital Services Playbook is a list of 13 plays that government can make for better technology policy and practices, beginning with Understand what people need and ending with Default to open. The reasoning behind each play is explained and the playbook includes a checklist of things to do successfully carry out the play, and questions to ask to ensure youre making the right choice.
For example, the checklist for Default to open includes the command to Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public. The key questions include If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Who uses it? How is it documented?
The Maria Shirts and her colleagues left City Hall and started Digital Core in October. They have not had much luck getting the playbook in government hands. Their biggest coup, getting it in front of a staffer in Ceara, only occurred in the past few months, through one of their connections in HackersBR, a national network of civic hackers in Brazil. (HackersBR, while only four months old, has spread to more than ten cities already.)
Shirts says that they also have a close relationship with the opposition, the Sustainability Network party, and they shared the playbook with some of their candidates in 2014, but none of them were elected.
Baby steps, but we are getting there, says Shirts.
Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America and former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer, tells Civicist that there was no attempt made to track international adoption of the USDS playbook but that she has heard it is being used in Puerto Rico.
Although she says I hope that everyone uses it, Pahlka acknowledges that the playbook was intended to validate an approach.
Its not possible to suddenly start following these practices without a lot of work, she adds.

Governmental disruption: Steven Levy reports for Mediums Backchannel on the rise of the U.S. Digital Service. Since USDS is already delivering measurable results for government IT development, heres the money quote, from its deputy director Haley van Dyck: Our institutional innovation strategy is, if we can prove our value over the next 18 months, we believe it will be asinine for the next administration to not continue to invest in this resource. She also adds, speaking of the services recruits from high-tech companies: about 66 percent of the people that came out for three months ended up going home, quitting their job and coming back full time. And its on the rise. I think its over 80 percent now.


Presidential disruption: Political scientist Lee Drutman of New America has a nifty suggestion for how to test presidential contenders worthiness for the White House. Instead of holding debates, have them handle a simulated crisis, like a terrorist attack or a bank failure. He writes, for the Washington Post, Film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-TV special. Make all the footage public, and journalists could comb through it and analyze who handled the situation best and why. Candidates could critique each others responses. Wed also learn about the quality of advice the candidates get.


Speaking of quality advisers, the Donald Trump campaign has fired a political consultant, Sam Nunberg, whose racist statements on Facebook were first uncovered by Hunter Walker of Business Insider.


Social disruption: Writing for Vox, Max Fisher takes note of the recent online campaign against American dentist Walter Palmer, who killed a beloved lion named Cecil, and argues that mob justice is not justice. Indeed, it looks like the human flesh search engines of China are now here.


Writing for the Atlantic, Rose Eveleth asks a really good question: Why Arent There More Women Futurists?


Speaking of the future, in China millions of young people are hooked on a realistic chatbot named Xiaoice, made by Microsoft, that has mined the Chinese internet for human conversations, John Markoff and Paul Mozur report for the New York Times. The program remembers details from previous exchanges with users, such as a breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend, and asks in later conversations how the user is feeling.


Uber disruption? Cory Doctorow tweets from FOO Camp: Building a co-op Uber alternative that returned Ubers share of the $$ to riders/drivers is as hard as making Linux... and adds, Therefore, the existence of GNU/Linux proves that building a co-op, open alternative to Uber is eminently do-able.


One of Ubers top New York political consultants, Bradley Tusk, Mike Bloombergs former campaign manager, is starting Tusk Ventures, a political consulting firm geared toward helping start-ups work withand in some cases, beat backgovernment regulators, reports Dino Grandoni for the New York Times.


Ideological disruption: If youve ever wondered what exactly is so grating about the Aspen Ideas Festival and all the other happy chatter that warbles down from places like the Aspen Institute all summer long, read the text of a speech author Anand Giridharadas gave at the Aspen Institutes Action Forum last week. A tidbit:

The Aspen Consensus, in a nutshell, is this: the winners of our age must be challenged to do more good. But never, ever tell them to do less harm. The Aspen Consensus holds that capitalisms rough edges must be sanded and its surplus fruit shared, but the underlying system must never be questioned. The Aspen Consensus says, Give back, which is of course a compassionate and noble thing. But, amid the $20 million second homes and $4,000 parkas of Aspen, it is gauche to observe that giving back is also a Band-Aid that winners stick onto the system that has privileged them, in the conscious or subconscious hope that it will forestall major surgery to that systemsurgery that might threaten their privileges.


Civic disruption: Chicago has announced a new system using public data to prioritize inspections restaurants most likely to have health code problems, helping them resolve any issues as quickly as possible and prevent foodborne illnesses before they ever begin, according to a press release from Mayor Rahm Emanuels office. The system was created as party of a $1 million grant to Chicago from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge.

This paragraph is key: no prescription for success in the Chinese market can be complete without a plan for managing the true source of political power: the Chinese government. As protests by taxi drivers erupted in multiple cities across China, Uber recently acknowledged its commitment to maintain social order by using its GPS data to track drivers and their locations near protests and canceling their Uber contracts if they were near such protestsa strong signal to the government that its cache of data could be used for the social order maintaining objectives of the state.


Alex Rosenblat of the Data & Society Institute has a fascinating piece up on Motherboard detailing some of oddities of Ubers ecosystem, including phantom cars that a user often sees when they open the app (to entice them to think drivers are close by?), and the strategies drivers and passengers alike use to take advantage of (or avoid) surge pricing.

Petition 2.0: On first taking his job earlier this year, White House chief digital officer Jason Goldman said he would look into the backlog of unanswered WeThePeople e-petitions, and yesterday he produced results, Alex Howard reports for Huffington Post, announcing that from this point forward qualified petitions would get official answers within 60 days, and sharing responses for 20 long-unanswered petitions, including one from two years ago (!) calling for Edward Snowdens pardon (which was unsurprisingly rejected).


Heres Goldmans post on Medium (his former employer), explaining the updates to WeThePeople.


Writing for Civicist, Dave Karpf argues that the most important news here isnt the promise of a response within 60 days, its Change.orgs decision to partner with WeThePeople on petitions aimed at the administration. As he notes, most people sign one WeThePeople petition and never come back. Only two or three petitions are started per day on WeThePeople. Change.org receives hundreds per day. Not only does the partnership mean that Change and WeThePeople are no longer competing for users attention, Karpf adds, The more that WeThePeople integration is baked into the functionality of other large petition sites, the harder it will be for the next President to shutter WeThePeoples doors.


Writing for Politico, Sarah Wheaton puts the WeThePeople news in context of the White Houses longer up-and-down history of experimenting with and using digital tools. And she quotes some guy named Sifry who suggests that if Goldman and team really want to score some digital engagement points, they should try some more free-wheeling ideas, like a Wiki for suggestions about how Obama should spend his post-presidency, or a crowdsourcing site for pointing out government waste.


Tech and the presidentials: Sen. Rand Pauls campaign is struggling with deep fundraising and organizational problems, Alex Isenstadt reports for Politico. Among Pauls problems: he hasnt succeeded at cultivating a sugar daddy. Peter Thiel, the libertarian Silicon Valley VC, helped his fathers 2012 run, but Isenstadt says he is now unlikely to be a major contributor to the younger Paul. The senator also canceled a planned appearance at Auren Hoffmans Dialog Retreat, another opportunity to tap tech libertarian types.


Pauls digital director, Vincent Harris, went to Googles VidCon conference last week and came back convinced that his party is doing online video wrong. He writes on Medium, Republican campaigns, institutions, and advocacy groups are doing a great job of tv-ing the internet, while missing the key differences in the style, substance, and type of content that needs to be created for younger audiences.


In a new paper, They Dont Give a Damn About Governing, published by Harvards Shorenstein Center, journalist Jackie Calmes reports on how conservative media exerts enormous influence on the Republican party. For anyone wondering why Donald Trump is doing so well at the moment, Calmes paper is must-reading. Heres a taste of what she found:

Its not just talk radio, but the blogosphere, the internettheyre all intertwined now. Youve got this constant chorus of skepticism about anything the quote-unquote establishment does, said a longtime former top aide to House Republican leaders, Dave Schnittger. And, he said, the chorus is loudest in opposition to those actions that are fundamental to governing: meeting basic fiscal deadlines for funding the government and allowing it to borrow. Those are the things that leaders have to get done as part of governing, the Republican said, as much as conservative media may hate it.


And this:

Tom Latham, a longtime House Republican who retired in January, said, All the social media, Facebook, all this stuff has had a huge impact, in that theres a group of people out there for whom everything is immediate. It isnt necessarily verified as being true; theres a lot of opinion stated as fact. And they [conservative media] can arouse a lot of people just instantaneously. When Latham came to Congress with the big Republican class elected in 1994, We didnt have internet, didnt have that type of instantaneous communication, he said. Twenty years later, constituent contacts to his office went from maybe 7,000 a year up to, when I left, to 35,000 to 40,000 contacts a year, just because of the ease of communication and people popping off the emails every day. A lot of that is generated by the conservative talk show people and media people.


Calmes also made smart use of Media Clouds news search tool, finding a dramatic difference between conservative and liberal media in coverage of the Common Core education curriculum.


Annals of open government: Waldo Jaquith of U.S. Open Data explains how they created a simple, free, open source software product that will help states publish verifiable legal data, and thus are heading off a rising tendency to lock it up in the hard-to-access .pdf format in order to comply with the Uniform Electronic Legal Materials Act.


Future present: Frank Pasquale and Siva Vaidhyanathan, two of academias sharpest tech critics, write for The Guardian that when disruptive companies like Airbnb and Uber posture as righteous champions of freedom while they flout standing employment and anti-discrimination laws, they are actually invoking a different history: the choice by reactionary Southerners to nullify federal laws they didnt like. In doing so, they argue, these companies undermine local needs and effective governance.


Nick Grossman of Union Square Ventures, always a little ahead of the curve, says he sees the emergence of a whole swath of new networked services that will fill the gaps left by the unbundling of the job giving independent workers a variety of supports from help with job discovery and equipment to administrative help and insurance benefits.


Blockchain technology could be useful in protecting user-generated video of official misbehavior, distributing welfare payments, and providing people with official IDs, reports Emily Spaven of CoinDesk.


This is civic tech: Eilis ONeil reports for us on Civicist about the efforts of Black Girls Code, where girls learn not only how to code, but how not to feel like a weirdo for wanting to.

There is much discussion about the precise opportunities for integrating digital tools or information communication technologies (ICTs) into the political sphere. After an initial wave of tech utopianism, some are searching for more tempered and realistic implementations of technology to strengthen democratic governance. This includes leveraging these tools to hold government accountable to its citizens.
With support from the Open Society Foundation, I was part of a small research team in 2010 led by Archon Fung to conduct original field research in Brazil, Chile, India, Kenya, and the Slovak Republic. In India, for example, I witnessed the power of digital tools to reduce barriers to entry, empowering students to crowdsource information on elected officials running for office.  In an environment of paid news, where advertisements can be concealed as news, crowdsourced information was able to serve as a credible source.
Based on this research, we found three particularly salient models for how technology might improve democratic transparency and legitimacy. These included: 1) truth-based advocacy, 2) political mobilization, and 3) social monitoring. In all these examples, the underlying premise is that there are lessons from the realm of commerce and social life that can be integrated into the political realm. However, it is not as simple as a one-to-one analogy. Rather, in the realm of civic and social life, politics and local context are much more critical than in the commercial or social spheres.
We conclude:
A third political party in the United States, or more likely Brazil, could embrace an ICT that made party leadership much more transparently responsive to constituent interests, became massively popular, and as a result displace one of the existing partiesa political analogy to Netflix or Amazon displacing brick-and-mortar video rental shops. / Such technology has not yet emerged. We hope that it will. But todays governance ICTs operate in a more incremental, less revolutionary, way.

Our complete findings were collected in a recent World Bank publication, Deliberation and Development: Rethinking the Role of Voice and Collective Action in Unequal Societies, which you can find here.

Last year I argued that the White Houses epetition site WeThePeople had become a virtual ghost town, but today the administrations Chief Digital Officer, Jason Goldman announced some important changes that promise to breathe new life into what had become a stagnant site.
The White House has cleared out the backlog of 20 truant petitions that had exceeded the 100,000 signature threshold but never received an official response, including several originally submitted in 2011 and 2012, along with the two-year-old petition to pardon Edward Snowden. It also has announced a new policy that all petitions that clear the threshold will receive a response within 60 days wherever possible. It has created a new team of people responsible for answering citizen petitions. It has posted more open code to Drupal.org and GitHub as an extension of its Write API, inviting third-party websites to integrate their petition-gathering with the White House site. And Change.org has announced that it will be the first major site to take advantage of the Write API, and will begin partnering with WeThePeople on petitions aimed at the administration.
The new 60-day policy is a welcome correction. It restores the promise of the site and makes a meaningful commitment that, if citizens collectively come together and petition their government, the government will listen and offer a timely response. The timeliness of response is crucial, specifically because the administration isnt promising to agree with the petitioners.
A petition is just a single political tactic. If you want to change government policy, a petition alone usually wont be enough. When the government negatively responds to your petition, that creates a focusing event. Its an opportunity for additional media scrutiny and political organizing.  
Take a look at how the Huffington Post has covered the Pardon Edward Snowden petition. Snowdens supporters rallied over 100,000 people to sign that WeThePeople petition in June 2013. Then 25 months passed. During that time (as John Oliver pointed out in April), public attention has mostly drifted away from Snowdens revelations. The White House response will put this issue back on the public agenda, at least for a little while. Its like oxygen to the activist fireeven when the government disagrees, the act of public disagreement is far preferable to suffocating silence.
That being said, the 60-day response policy is far from the most important part of Goldmans announcement. The Change.org partnership is much more significant in the long term. The partnership is crucial because it lessens the tension between being the venue for and the target of political petitions. It means that WeThePeople is no longer competing with Change.org, MoveOn.org, Credo Mobilize, Care2, or Democracy.io.  These organizations are optimized to promote long-term, large-scale citizen engagement.  The White House petition site isnt (and probably shouldnt be). Rather than choosing between creating a WeThePeople petition or creating a Change.org petition, motivated citizens can reap advantages from both.
It also means that we can rightly start to measure WeThePeople by different metrics than the other sites. And thats important, because its when you evaluate WeThePeople according to the same metrics as MoveOn petitions or Change.org that the ghost town imagery emerges.
Consider: 19.5 million individuals have signed a WeThePeople petition. There have been a total of 27.7 million signatures. Depending on how you measure it, thats either a very large number or a surprisingly small number. If the White House petition site were an advocacy group, it would be almost 2.5 times larger than MoveOn.org. But the ratio of users to signatures means that, on average, people have signed only 1.42 petitions apiece.  Or, put another way, most people sign one WeThePeople petition and never come back. Only 2 or 3 petitions are started per day on WeThePeople. Change.org receives hundreds per day. Those are ghost town metrics: People visit once, see little, and never return.
By comparison, SumOfUs.org has developed a measure called MeRA (members returning for action) to determine its effectiveness. If people take one action with SumOfUs, then never come back again, SumOfUs calls this a weakness, not a strength. Sites like MoveOn.org and Change.org devote tremendous resources towards optimizing their sites to promote active petition-creation, petition-sharing, and repeat petition-signing. Their MeRA scores are much higher than WeThePeoples.
If you are a social movement organization that wants to build power for social reforms, repeat member engagement is very important to you. Its a key building block in developing the type of deep engagement that can eventually drive social change. Up until now, the White House site was effectively competing with these movement organizations for our civic attention. Integrating with Change.org means this competitive relationship becomes a collaborative relationship. If groups like MoveOn and Care2 follow suit, it will represent an important evolution within the digital petition world.  
The Change.org partnership also improves the likely longevity of the site. When the next President takes office in January 2017, he or she will have to decide whether open petitions and digital government is going to remain a priority. Jimmy Carter installed solar panels during his time in office. Ronald Reagan tore them off. I doubt a President Trump would place as high a priority on digital civic engagement as President Obama has. The more that WeThePeople integration is baked into the functionality of other large petition sites, the harder it will be for the next President to shutter WeThePeoples doors.
Moving forward, Ill be watching for two things to determine just how successful this revitalized WeThePeople turns out to be:

Does the White House keep its 60-day commitment when a wave of big, controversial petitions arrives? Jason Goldman has made a promise here. Im hopeful that hell stand behind it. It will be a few months before we know for sure.
Do other third-party platforms like MoveOn Petitions, Care2, and Credo Mobilize follow Change.orgs lead and integrate with WeThePeople? Its no surprise that Change.org took the lead hereopen government advocate Jake Brewer recently left Change.org for a job at the White House, and Change.org is the 800 pound gorilla of petition sites. If the other civil society petition sites all follow Change.orgs lead, that will clearly establish WeThePeoples niche.  

In light of todays announcement, I think its fair to say that WeThePeople is no longer a virtual ghost town. Its becoming more like a virtual resort destinationlots of visitors, who get a lot out of their experience, but very few locals who actually call the place home.
And thats probably how it should be.

Black Girls CODE Memphis Chapter Build a Game in A Day Workshop, July 26, 2014. (Photo courtesy Black Girls Code)

Its late Sunday morning after a long weekend of coding, and four computer programmers are rushing to link up their mockups in one master file. Theyre facing a hard 2:00 PM deadline. But these four arent just any computer programmers: theyre teenagers, and theyve just spent the weekend learning how to code in a whirlwind of workshops, brainstorming sessions, and hacking at the Black Girls Code hackathon in Brooklyn, New York. Two mentors in pink shirts with the hashtag #changeherpath are helping the four girls design their app, which would help teens who feel discriminated against because of their weight, sexual orientation, religion, or socioeconomic status.
The weekend-long hackathon aimed to teach girls between the ages of 11 and 17 how to use tech to make the world a better place and how to take an idea from start to finish, says New York chapter lead Onyi Nwosu. She hopes that, along the way, participants were inspired to consider pursuing a career in computing or technology.
Currently, women comprise only 27 percent of employees in computer and mathematical occupations, and only 17 percent of computer science grads. The U.S. Department of Labor predicts that, by 2020, 1.4 million new computer specialist jobs will open up, but, if current trends continue, there will only be enough computer science graduates to fill about 30 percent of those positions. Programs like Black Girls Code aim to get a more diverse generation of coders into those jobs.
Founded in 2011 in the Bay Area by electrical engineer and biotech professional Kimberly Bryant, Black Girls Code was one of the first in what is a growing cadre, including the Ada Developers Academy, Yes We Code, Girls Who Code, and others that aim to inspire young people from more diverse communities to pursue careers in computer science. The organization gets its funding from a patchwork of sources, including individual donors, foundations and corporate sponsors, and two big crowdfunding campaigns. With over $1,000,000 this year alone, the organization has spread rapidly all over the country, hosting workshops, hackathons, and summer camps for girls in Oakland, New York City, Memphis, Detroit, Chicago, and elsewhere. About 3,000 girls participate in the programs each year, many of them repeats from previous years, and founder Kimberly Bryant hopes to teach 1,000,000 girls how to code by 2040.
Onyi Nwosu, of Black Girls Code, says she works in tech and never experienced explicit biasbut, when youre in an engineering class and youre the only woman, it makes you question whether or not you belong.
Thats why she started volunteering for Black Girls Code. She says, at Black Girls Code events, girls are able to meet other girls like them so they dont feel like a weirdo for liking to code. The community and support girls find at these events can help them stay in tech when the going gets rough. For girls, there are a lot of discouragements along the way, but, if they have a community, theyre more likely to keep at it.
So Black Girls Code and programs like it aim to address the issue of stereotype threatthe notion that girls stay away from tech because they believe they wont be good at it, or because they believe others wont think theyre good at it. Even one-day and weekend-long events can help tackle these issues by providing role models and by giving girls concrete skills and a sense of accomplishment, says Catherine Hill, vice president of research at the American Association of University Women (AAUW). A weekend isnt much time, she says, but it is enough to bring those stereotypes to your consciousness so that you are aware of them. Once people are aware of their stereotypes, she says, they have the opportunity to question and challenge them. Furthermore, she adds, participants at these events learn that they can learn computing. By setting up girls to succeed on small tasks, they develop confidence in their ability to learn computing skills.
Black Girls Code was founded to redefine [the] dominant narrative, to shift this paradigm, to make a radical and fundamental and lasting change in the technology industry, Kimberly Bryant, the founder of Black Girls Code, said in remarks at Personal Democracy Forum 2013.
And the organization is starting to have an impact on the broader world. Brianna Fugate, a sophomore majoring in computer science at Spelman College, first encountered coding while volunteering at a Black Girls Code Build a Website in a Day event. After my volunteer experience with BGC, I was eager to soak up as much knowledge about coding and computer science, she writes. I now see myself as a future tech leader and problem-solver. She is currently a White House intern in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Another Black Girls Code alumna, Kaya Thomas, also a college sophomore studying computer scienceshes at Dartmouthcreated the iPhone application We Read Too, which features children and young adult books written by and about people of color. And fifteen-year-old Ayanna Kai Morton, whos been attending Black Girls Code summer camps since she was 10 years old, won a trip to Berlin this spring to attend the Dell Womens Entrepreneur Summit.
These stories are hopefulbut Catherine Hill, of the AAUW, says obstacles remain. Resume studies, which involve sending out resumes identical in all particulars except the gender of the candidates name, have shown that hiring managers tend to rank more highly resumes involving male-identified skills when the heading shows a male-gendered name. Some tech companies, like Google, have tried to solve that problem by deleting names from resumes before giving them out, but not every tech company has the resources or desire to add that extra step. Furthermore, Hill adds, women sometimes feel out of place in what she calls techs bro culture, and there are higher rates of sexual harassment in tech than on average.
We have to admit that there are huge, systemic problems, says John Enyame, whos been volunteering at Black Girls Code events in New York for the past year and a half. This weekend, hes mentoring a group of four girls between the ages of 11 and 13 as they design what he describes as a positivity app. We are adding to a body of approaches to create a new normal for the next generation, he says.
As Enyame speaks, the girls on his team run by with their other mentor. Were going to play the energy game, they call out to him, practically bouncing up and down.
Enyame explains that, when the girls in his group get restless, they sometimes leave their classroom and computers behind and go to another space to brainstorm new ways to tackle a problem.
The payoff of all this work, Enyame says, is still in the future. The same way systemic and implicit bias have built over time, the results we are going to see will happen incrementally over time, he says.
Catherine Hill, of the AAUW, is hopeful. One of the exciting things is we really can make a difference, she says. Theres a lot more we can do to help people choose careers. What we do now is limited, and we need to give students an opportunity to try things out, because women are likely to assume that they cant do something much too quickly. Engineering and computing is not for everybody, but engineers and computer scientists are made, not born. And we need to provide those opportunities and recruit women for those opportunities, and I think what were going to find is a richer and more diverse workplace.

Here are five common-sense, bipartisan principles for building a smart, digital government, offered by Republican Matt Lira and Democrat Nick Sinai writing for Politico. As they note, The 2016 presidential candidates like to talk about innovation, and theyre currently debating the tech-fueled gig economy. Those are important issues, but when it comes to how government meets the digital world, theres a crucial component theyre not talking about. More like this, please.


Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times ombudswoman, retraces how the paper got the Hillary Clinton email criminal referral story wrong, blaming the rush to get a scoop and unreliable, anonymous sources.


Commenting on Sullivans story, Josh Marshall of TalkingPointsMemo zeroes in on Times executive editor Dean Baquets mea culpa. Baquet told Sullivan: You had the government confirming that it was a criminal referral. Im not sure what [the Times reporters and editors] could have done differently on that. Marshall responds, This is a telling statement. The government didnt tell the Times anything. Anonymous people in the government told them something. Big, big difference.


An unsigned editors note in todays Times effectively apologizes for not correcting the original Clinton criminal referral email story sooner.


Bernie Sanders campaign is planning to live-stream into several thousand house parties nationwide Wednesday night, and as Aaron Davis observes for the Washington Post, Whether Sanders can use the internet to build an effective campaign remains to be seen. Sanders told him he believes the event will be the largest digital organizing event in the history of this country, which may be true for a presidential campaign this early in the cycle. This map produced by the Sanders campaign shows 3,146 organizing meetings with 82,465 RSVPs. Looks to me like a pretty effective internet-driven campaign so far.


Tech billionaire loudmouth Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks, star of Shark Tank) takes a stand for his class, according to Fox & Friends, saying I have to honestly (say) he is probably the best thing to happen in a long long time. I dont care what his actual positions are. I dont care if he says the wrong thing. He says whats on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years.


Heres a corollary to the Barbara Streisand Effect, which is what happens when you try to suppress something online: If, in the course of trying to intimidate a reporter from writing a damaging story about a past, reported event, such as Donald Trumps violation of his then-spouse Ivana Trump, your lawyer says, Im warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what Im going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting, then your lawyer actually has invoked the Streisand Effect.


Dave Pells Next Draft of the Future, written for Vices Motherboard, is wickedly good on current events, despite being written from the future.


Elizabeth Gillis reports for the Berkman Center blog on its Internet Monitor project, which is developing a new dashboard for understanding how people all over the world access and use the net.


Related: Vindu Goel reports for the New York Times on Facebooks efforts to sell its Internet.org project, describing it as an ambitious effort to connect the worlds poorest people to the internet, without mentioning that in fact it doesnt connect them to anything like the actual internet.


Writing for The Verge, Ariha Setalvad also describes Internet.orgs expansion as making it easier for any mobile operator to sign up to offer free internet access to basic online services, again failing to note that Internet.org does not provide users a connection to the open internet.


Julie Scelfo reports for the New York Times on how recent college suicides, often happening in clusters, may be in part a response to accentuated social pressure fed by social media. Describing one students descent, Scelfo writes, Friends lives, as told through selfies, showed them having more fun, making more friends and going to better parties. Even the meals they posted to Instagram looked more delicious.


The NSA will destroy the phone metadata it has been collecting on Americans since 2001, the APs Ken Delanian reports.


A group of leading artificial intelligence and robotics researchers, plus non-experts like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Noam Chomsky, have signed onto an open letter calling for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons.


Josh Tauberer of GovTrack has launched a Kickstarter to hire a full-time researcher to add more information about the daily activities of Congress.


GovDelivery announced this morning that it has acquired Textizen, a product of Code for Americas inaugural incubator program that enables government agencies to communicate via mobile messaging with the public.


A new ranking of start-up ecosystems looking at the broad infrastructure of talent, knowledge, entrepreneurs, venture capital, and companies that make up a startup community has San Francisco first, New York City second, Los Angeles third, Boston fourth and Tel Aviv fifth, Richard Florida reports for CityLab. The global study did not include cities in China, Taiwan, Japan or South Korea due to language barriers.

Andrew Slack speaking at Personal Democracy Forum 2015

We do not need magic to transform the world. We carry all the power we need inside of us already. We have the power to imagine better. J.K. Rowling
If the definition of technology is any tool or process we use to organize ourselves to achieve some goal, then the most important technology we have, as humans, is our culture. Culture is the knowledge we collect and pass on to our children, the rituals we use to organize society and give meaning to life, and the expectations we have of how people are supposed to behave. And any discussion of the potential of civic tech to change the world for the better has to confront the challenge that culture presents.
The hardest thing to change, when it comes to getting an organization or institution to embrace a new technology or way of doing things, isnt the technical capacity of that organizations staff. Its something more amorphous: its culture. Otherwise, as management expert Peter Drucker says, culture eats strategy for breakfast.
Today, our civic culture is at a crossroads. Many Americans appear to be withdrawing from public engagement, frustrated by the seeming ineffectiveness of traditional political processes. Meanwhile, theres new energy around the idea of doing-it-ourselves, using the disruptive potential of the open internet, open data, and social networks, to make things work better.
So it feels like a great moment to come to Civic Hall to explore how we might hack the civic culture, and look for ways to turn some of the energy that our culture now channels into entertainment and distraction and outdated rituals into more substantial kinds of public engagement.
As I approach this work, Im drawing on the insights of several great teachers, starting with Henry Jenkins, Provost Professor at USC Annenberg. Jenkins defines the civic imagination as the capacity to imagine creative alternatives to current social, political, or economic institutions or problems. When we address the civic imagination, we are addressing the heart of our malleable societal norms.
It was Jenkins who helped me understand the work Ive done for the last ten years with the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA). The HPA uses parallels from Harry Potter to engage fans across the world to improve upon the story of our world. Together, HPA members have built libraries in Rwanda, Detroit, the Mississippi Delta, and Brooklyn; sent five cargo planes to Haiti; funded the protection of thousands of civilians in Darfur and East Burma; continue to give to their local communities in our 270 chapters in over 30 countries. After more than four years of advocacy, we got Warner Bros to make all Harry Potter chocolate Fair Trade or Utz- certified.
After extensive research on the HPA, Jenkins writes:
These kids werent political when they first joined HPA: They dont come from the kinds of backgrounds where politically active youth traditionally come from. Research has shown that most kids who go on to be politically and civically engaged first learn to talk about politics around the dinner table; they have a civics teacher who brings in real-world examples, and connects their history book to their lives; theyre involved in certain extracurricular activities like student government. After the age of 16 or 17, their lifelong political engagement tends to be fairly predetermined. The HPAs work is breaking that mold.

In all of our efforts, weve been inspired by JK Rowlings statement about our power to imagine better.
Unfortunately, instead of imagining better, the civic culture conjured by our national leaders and elected representatives seems barren of such optimism and does little to speak to us as anything more than consumers of government, or just as plain old consumers. What an impoverished civic imagination that implies! Mainstream education debates are focused on test scores without prioritizing the complex inner lives of our students, our political experience is dominated by big money, etc. If what we appreciate, appreciates, we are building a society of human beings with little respect for anything human or imaginative. Even some of our best government innovators are pushing to improve public services not because they add to human dignity but because they want government to treat its customers at least as well as Amazon or Google.
Worry about how many Americans are turning off from civic engagement has led to some well-intentioned efforts that misunderstand the problem. While Retired Justice Sandra Day OConnor has done terrific work on iCivics, an online platform that uses video games to help students learn more about how government works, she is mistaken in thinking the central problem is a nosedive in how we as citizens understand our political institutions.
Ethan Zuckerman of MITs Center for Civic Media has not only pointed out that the data does not reflect the existence of such a collapse in civic knowledge, he has joined Jenkins in arguing for a broader definition of civics that is far more accurate to the experience of all citizens, particularly to young people. Whether we know it or not, we are engaged in the makings of a civic experience every time we are on social media. Think of how hashtags have become cultural statements, even the names of political movements. The challenge is not, as OConnor hopes, to get people to expand their knowledge of how government works. The crisis in civics is, in actuality, a crisis in agency. The solution is more efforts to revive and expand our civic imagination.
The crisis in civic agency is causing exponential damage. While most people believe that issues like human rights atrocities, widespread inequality, and ecological devastation are serious and deserve immediate attention, the average person does not believe they can do anything about them. Weve lost incalculable energy, talent, and resources on solving complex problems because of the frustration, fatigue, and complacency that come from feeling overwhelmed and helpless.
Through my experience in co-founding and directing the HPA, I have seen first-hand how building a robust civic imagination can lead to a vibrant community discovering its agency through campaigns that effect social change and helps other changemakers replicate those victories on a wider scale. The accomplishments of the HPA stand in the way of grown ups who tell kids to get their heads out of fantasy and into the so-called real world; in fact, fantasy is not simply an escape from our world but an invitation to go deeper into it. We dream at night, but our culture dreams through books and movies and stories. Working with those stories is cultural dream work. Working with stories that we put energy into is cultural acupuncture. And that is where I hope to focus my work as Civic Halls first Civic Imagination Fellow.
In cultural acupuncture, we find where the psychological energy is in the culture, and move that energy towards creating a healthier body for our world. In cultural acupuncture, stories are the proverbial needles; stories are what resonate. Stories are what can expand our civic imagination and allow us a transformed sense of agency.
My plans as a Civic Imagination Fellow are ambitious. One area of focus is the invention and re-appropriation of holidays. In recent years, weve seen a huge trend in this direction. Seattle recently changed Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Some have equally serious goals, like Mandela Day, when people are called to take action to change the world; or Giving Tuesday, when online advocacy groups push post-Thanksgiving shoppers to donate to good causes. And others have a more light-hearted emphasis, like April Fools Day online, or Talk Like a Pirate Day.
On August 3, to get things going, Ill be hosting a meetup at Civic Hall around Esther Day. Named after my dear friend, the late Esther Earl (who inspired John Green to write the bestselling book and blockbuster film, the Fault In Our Stars) and led by the foundation in her name, Esther Day is the worlds first baggage-free holiday about love.
Beyond exploring how we reboot our national holidays, I will also be developing several culture hacking campaigns, including one that draws on the attention around the Hunger Games movie to expand the discussion around economic inequality, and an even more ambitious effort to tap the excitement around the upcoming Star Wars film to help focus more attention on the problem of big money in politics.
Theres so much more to come and I look forward to a dialogue here and in person as we collaboratively explore an ambitious agenda to fire up the civic imagination.

Yesterday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Republican Presidential candidate Jeb Bush rolled his eyes at the mention of the #BlackLivesMatter movement and Democratic candidate Martin OMalleys having apologized for saying white lives matter. Bush then commented, according to David Weigel reporting for the Washington Post, Were so uptight and so politically correct now that we apologize for saying lives matter? The video of Bushs comments was captured by trackers from American Bridge and quickly posted online. If you listen closely, Bush appears to accuse the #BlackLivesMatter movement of not believing that white lives matter.

Heres a chapter and verse breakdown of how Uber steamrolled New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, from Dana Rubinstein and Laura Nahmias in Capital New York.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken over a private website, FAFSA.com, which had been operated by a private company charging prospective students for help filling out their financial aid applications, something that directly contradicted the intent of FAFSA (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid), reports Alex Howard for Huffington Post. The site is being transferred to the Department of Education, he reports, as part of legal action against the private company, Student Financial Aid Services. This act of what Howard calls digital eminent domain may indeed be a first (pun intended, Alex?). Now, if only the Department of Education cared as much about helping indebted students with useful tech as it does about helping them get indebted, and didnt leave that job to volunteers. [CORRECTION: Howard has posted an update to his story: while Student Financial Aid Services does face legal action regarding overcharging and other issues, it voluntarily transferred the FAFSA.com domain. So, in essence, this wasnt an act of digital eminent domain, as intriguing a prospect as that may be.]

White House Presidential Innovation Fellow Denice Ross blogs on Medium about an amazing moment she witnessed during a three-day coding event where the New Orleans Police Department and the citys office of information technology and innovation released a preview of four city databases for a group of teenage coders and their mentors to build apps with. The event was part of the administrations Police Data Initiative which is working with 24 jurisdictions around the country to encourage better use of data to build community trust and reduce police violence.


As part of that initiative, data scientists are looking at how police departments can better use predictive analytics to figure out which of their officers may be more likely to overreact violently during stressful situations, Larry Greenemeier reports for Scientific American.


Reviewing data scientist Cathy ONeils provocative talk at Personal Democracy Forum this past June on Weapons of Math Destruction, political scientist and Civicist contributing editor Dave Karpf gently pushes back against her fear that political micro-targeting is bad for democracy. The tl/dr version: hes not very worried about it because campaigns have always targeted voters, now theyre getting a bit more efficient at it, and most potential abuses are likely to be caught before they do serious harm.


Wesley Lowery and David Weigel of the Washington Post report on Why Hillary Clinton and her rivals are struggling to grasp Black Lives Matter. They write: The strained interactions demonstrate the extent to which a vibrant new force on the left has disrupted traditional presidential politics, creating challenges for Democratic candidates who are facing intense pressure to put police brutality and other race-related issues on the front burner ahead of the 2016 election.

I dont think the government should be in the business of restricting job growth.


Later in the day, the two sides came to an agreement: the de Blasio administration is abandoning its push for the Uber cap, and in exchange the company is giving the city a trove of internal data that it had been seeking for its congestion study, Matt Flegenheimer reports for the New York Times. Both sides are also stopping their war of words.

How aggressive a campaign should a publicly traded company present to its users? Are there legal limits to corporate-driven free speech?


Now this would be a Smart City: As hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers struggle to obtain or keep food stamp benefits, baffled by complex filing requirements, City Councilman Ben Kallos (and PDM friend) has introduced legislation that would require city agencies to send people pre-filled applications for the benefits that they are entitled to, Winnie Hu reports for the New York Times.

Ive been collecting examples of tech companies politicizing their users for two years, and theres never been anything like Ubers in-app protest against Mayor de Blasio.
If youre here reading Civicist, youre probably in favor of increased rates of civic engagement. In our representative democracy, we generally agree that citizens taking democratic action is a virtuous deed, whether its signing a petition, writing to elected officials, or best yet, according to conventional engagement wisdom, marching in the streets. But its time to consider how we feel when a technology company directly encourages its users to take the specific political action the company desires, because the practice is spreading quickly.
The most popular web applications boast over one billion users, with many more products reaching at least millions of people. The ability to ask so many people to take a specific, pre-determined, and coordinated political action is real power. In 2013, I began tracking emerging examples of companies mobilizing their customers toward political ends via their marketing emails and flagship applications, and the trend has only accelerated.
In 2012, Facebook published a study they conducted during the 2010 midterm elections. They showed that they could increase the likelihood of a user going to the polls by 0.39 percent that year if the user saw a dialog showing that their friends had voted. Micah Sifry has written about the impact of these and other, more subtle News Feed manipulations. For example, in the three months leading up to the 2012 election, Facebook boosted hard news stories in the News Feeds of some (1.9 million) users, which had a measurable impact on engagement and voter turnout.
Last year, Jonathan Zittrain played out a hypothetical scenario to suggest that if Facebooks algorithms were influenced by the same partisanship with which we draw our actual electoral district boundaries, we could experience digital gerrymandering, without the ability to see the evidence. Specifically, Zittrain writes, Digital gerrymandering occurs when a site distributes information in a manner that serves its own ideological agenda.
The goal of the Facebook research study was to promote voter turnout among its users, even though some users did not see the treatment and therefore did not receive the boost in turnout. But today apps are driving their userssometimes literallyto take specific political actions to achieve explicit political goals the companies wish to see by directly inserting those actions into the user experience itself. Its not so much digital gerrymandering as it is digital ballot-stuffing.
Some of the interventions have been in support of values the companies seek to promote. OKCupid famously protested Mozilla CEO Brendan Eichs support of Proposition 8 by detecting users browsers and then serving everyone on Firefox a letter asking them to switch to a gay-friendly browser:
I JUST realized that the OKCupid team listed Internet Explorer as Internet Exploder.
By far the most potent example of companies mobilizing customers remains the SOPA blackout campaign, an unprecedented defense of the open internet driven primarily by a relatively small number of people with access to the homepages of major web properties. When the campaign launched back in 2011, I wrote about how the web was beginning to find its footing as a political force by driving their users to oppose the bills. Tumblr alone redirected enough users through their call Congress workflow to produce 87,834 phone calls.
Some tech companies have leveraged their users against political opponents outside of government. Around this time last summer, Amazon responded to Authors United with Readers United, invoking the historical disruption of the paperback novel in asking its customers to join their side and email the opposing CEO in their pricing battle with a major publisher.

Standing up for innovation (or against regulation, depending on you look at it)
The value that tech startups most often ask their users to defend is the value found in their own business models. As companies disrupt various industries, they face existential regulatory battles over their effect on contractor employees and the cities in which they operate. These are the battles in which some tech companies have been most eager to activate their customers and mobilize us to their defense.
In Aereos losing Supreme Court case against existing cable television regulations, the company sent a series of passionate campaign emails to users, not over civil rights or partisan politics, but in defense of what they perceived to be their right to re-transmit cable programming over the web. The emails pointed passionate users to the now-defunct ProtectMyAntenna.org.

The practice of activating customers has only intensified as sharing economy companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft fight for their very legality in cities all over the planet. Up against better-established and better-resourced industry groups, like traditional hotel and taxi interests, sharing economy companies are experimenting with increasing urgency by inviting their users to speak out and turn out in defense of their preferred terms of business.

In the short time Ive been collecting such examples, Uber has taken the lead with the most consistently user-fueled advocacy. Perhaps the most aggressive instance of David Plouffes global campaign came this week when the company launched added the name of New York Citys mayor, DE BLASIO, to the menu of ride options seen by its New York City users. The feature is a bold app-based political protest, offering not your ride, on demand, but a hypothetical 25 minute wait time the company foreshadows if Bill 842, a cap on new vehicles, became law.

If you read the feather-light grey print, youll see that by signing the petition, youre also agreeing to opt in to Ubers automatic telephone dialing system, or robocalls:
By entering your contact information and clicking Send Email, you agree that Uber may use this information for various purposes relating to this petition, including adding your name, email address, telephone number, and/or zip code to an electronic petition, displaying your name on print materials, and sending a letter or email on your behalf to your local officials, which may include your full name, city, and/or zip code. You also agree that Uber may contact you via email, phone, or SMS (including by automatic telephone dialing system) at the email address or number provided, for purposes relating to this petition.

The in-app protest augments the more traditional elements of Plouffes campaign: paid TV ads featuring New Yorkers, press outreach, mailers, and robocalls, all promising double or triple the wait times and over ten thousand lost jobs.
Is everyone else in NYC getting nuisance robocalls from Molly at Uber complaining about DeBlasio? I count 7 or 8 so far.

Hey, lawyers out there, are there rules about this kind of thing?
In which instances do we applaud corporate intervention by user interface, and in which do we decry it? How aggressive a campaign should a publicly traded company present to its users? Are there legal limits to corporate-driven free speech? Nonprofits arent legally allowed to oppose specific legislation, but eBay can, as they did in 2013 when they emailed their users in opposition of the Marketplace Fairness Act, a proposed bill that would allow states to collect sales taxes on online businesses without physical locations in the state.
Curb (formerly Taxi Magic) provided its users ride discounts on Election Day 2014 to help get them to the polls. Uber also provided free rides to customers, as long as they were headed to the companys demonstration. Are these digital advocacy investments, some of which surpass the efficacy of actual televised political ads, considered in-kind contributions? The new technological channels of political advocacy only complicate a democracy opened to corporate speech in the Citizens United decision. Im not holding my breath that the FEC will figure this out in the 2016 election cycle, but I am curious what others think.
Im in Austin to hear the Knight Foundation announce the winners of the Knight News Challenge, which will fund an entire class of projects and partnerships designed to inform and engage citizens about elections. Itll be worth discussing that in addition to PACs and campaigns themselves, these civic and media efforts will increasingly be competing for voters attention with the apps on their home screens.

This may be a first in online fundraising: Color of Change is trying to raise money to hire a private investigator to investigate the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Walter County prosecutor and sheriff responsible for handling Sandra Bland, who died nine days ago in police custody after being arrested for a minor traffic violation.


Very related: Freelance journalist Ben Norton notices that the official dash-cam video released by the Texas Department of Public Safety includes several bizarre edits, leading filmmaker Ava DuVernay to tweet: I edit footage for a living. But anyone can see that this official video has been cut. Read/watch. Why?


The Knight Foundation is announcing the winners of its latest News Challenge, focused on elections, this morning at the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life in Austin, starting at 10:30am ET. You can watch live here.


Our Jessica McKenzie has a report on one of the most interesting winning projects: Informed Voting from Start to Finish, a collaboration between Turbovote, e.thePeople, and the Center for Civic Design.


Congrats as well to the Internet Archive, which also won a News Challenge prize for its 2016 political ad tracker. Today the Archive and the GDELT Project are launching two amazing visualizations of TV news coverage, one focusing on how money flowed through campaign advertising in Philadelphia during the 2014 election cycle, and the other showcasing an innovative way of seeing what got picked up and rebroadcast from President Obamas 2015 State of the Union address. One fun finding: the most popular video clip from Obamas speech was when he ad-libbed his response to Republicans cheering his declaration that he had no more campaigns to run. As Kalev Lateru of George Washington University and GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) says, What you are seeing here is a first glimpse of a whole new way of exploring television, using enormously powerful computer algorithms as a new lens through which to explore the Internet Archives massive archive of television news.


Brave New Internet of Things: With the help of two hardworking car security researchers, Wireds Andy Greenberg completely owns the story of how todays connected cars can being remotely taken over by hackers accessing their controls through a vulnerability in their Uconnect system.


Chrysler is already taking steps to patch the security hole exposed by Greenbergs hacker friends, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, but many drivers probably wont take their cars in for a repair, leaving them vulnerable. Miller estimates that as many as 471,000 vehicles on the road may be at risk.


Coincidentally, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) yesterday introduced the Spy Car Act, calling on the FTC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to take steps to protect driver privacy and security against outside hacks.


The war of words between Uber and New York Mayor Bill De Blasio continued to escalate, Matt Flegenheimer of the New York Times reports, with the mayor and his political allies now comparing Uber to corporate behemoths like Wal-Mart.


Interviewed in Rome where he is attending a Vatican conference on climate change, De Blasio told The Guardian, I think its clear that as a corporation, as a multibillion dollar corporation, Uber thinks it can dictate to government. I remind them that the government represents the people and the peoples larger interest, and that is more important than any one companys needs. He also mentioned that he had commiserated with the mayor of Paris, whose own taxi drivers are also at war over the Uber issue.


Ben Popper of The Verge takes a close look at Ubers claim that the citys proposed one-year slowdown on the growth of ride-hailing services would kill its business and concludes, The claim that 10,000 new jobs would disappear if Uber cant license an unlimited supply of new cars is pretty hard to swallow.


In case you think Uber is just like any other tech company trying to get local governments to welcome its business, its worth reading Bloomberg News Karen Weises story from a month ago on how Uber conquered its critics in Portland, Oregon.


The White House has created a Twitter account for @TheIranDeal. The account mainly follows media figures, which makes sense because its part of the Obama administrations sales push for the agreement. But I was kind of hoping @TheIranDeal would also follow something like @NAFTA, or at least @TheNewDeal.


Nicko Margolies, the manager of the Sunlight Foundations now defunct Politwoops projects, points out to The Hills Mario Trujillo that theres nothing stopping private individuals from keeping track of deleted tweets from politicians. If we werent sort of a work-in-the-open organization, you could run Politwoops and just not tell anyone, he tells her. And I think Twitter probably wouldnt find out, he says at another point, before quickly adding, Thats not an endorsement.


The U.S. Department of Agriculture is putting up $75 million in loans and $11 million in grants to increase broadband access in rural areas in seven states.


Facebook doesnt have standing to challenge search warrants on behalf of its customers, a NY state appeals court ruled yesterday, James McKinley Jr. reports for the New York Times.


Heres an important data point from Josh Israels excellent report on the state of the progressive netroots for Think Progress: In 2006, the prominent progressive blog MyDD listed a progressive blogroll of the top websites in each of 43 states. Today, just 18 of those remain active.


RIP E.L. Doctorow, one of Americas great writers. Take a moment and ponder, or savor, what he had to say a year-and-a-half ago about the internet and culture when he received the National Book Award medal for his distinguished contribution to American letters.

Two organizations dedicated to voter education are teaming up to create a comprehensive voter guide that will include registration information, a polling place locator, election reminders, and candidate comparisons. Informed Voting from Start to Finish will be led by e.thePeople, a nonprofit that makes software that media organizations and civic groups like the League of Women Voters use to create voter guides for local and national elections. As one of the Knight News Challenge winners announced today, Informed Voting will receive $200,000 from the Knight Foundation.
The theme of this Knight News Challenge was elections, and applicants were prompted to propose a solution to the question, How might we better inform voters and increase civic participation before, during, and after elections?
E.thePeople is partnering with Democracy Works to bring election guides to more than 268,000 current TurboVote users who have signed up to receive voter registration forms or absentee ballots by mail, election reminders, or a combination of the three. (TurboVote received $1 million in funding support from the Knight Foundation in 2013.) A third partner, the Center for Civic Design, will lead the research component of the project, looking into which messages and tactics resonate most with users.
Were marrying resources, says Alex Quinn, executive director of e.thePeople. If you sign up for TurboVote and you get the voting reminder then you also get a link to the local voter guide...we kind of pick up where TurboVote leaves off.
From the Denver Post Voter Guide 2014 (powered by e.thePeople)
Brandon Naylor, Democracy Works director of communications, tells Civicist that the idea of nonprofits partnering up to accomplish a common goal is still pretty unusual. Were trying to sort of pave new territory here.
E.thePeople is an online organization from a simpler time; it was started in 1999, back when affixing an e to the front of a word or phrase was still a thing. (Andrew Rasiej, the co-founder of Civic Hall and publisher of Civicist, was an early advisor.) TurboVote launched more than a decade later and, as Alex Quinn points out, has a more direct relationship to individuals in the delivery of its services. It will be interesting to see what they can accomplish in tandem.
Perhaps most significant is the potential for expanding the reach of both e.thePeople and TurboVote. As already noted, through this project more than a quarter million TurboVote users will be prompted to check out a voter guide powered by e.thePeople. On the other hand, e.thePeoples voter guides had 3.3 million visitors in 2012 and they have estimated they will see 6 million visitors in 2016; if even a fraction of visitors to sign up for TurboVote, that would dramatically increase that organizations user base.
They will also be sharing networkse.thePeople is used by more than 150 media and civil society organizations, and Democracy Works partners with a lot of colleges. Quinn is very excited by the potential for cross-collaboration: What will also happen by the nature of the partnership is that well be able to introduce our partners to what TurboVote does and vice versa.
When asked what made e.thePeople right for tackling the problem of voter education, Chris Barr, director of media innovation at the Knight Foundation, said, They just have a pretty good history of doing this.
Other winning Knight News Challenge projects include an Associated Press effort to find the exit poll of the future; a political ad tracker by the Internet Archive; a get-out-the-vote initiative targeting barbers in black communities; and a toolkit election officials can use to engage local communities.

Civic EngagementDemocracyElections 







When crowds fill a public space they can change history, observed Marc Smith, director of the Social Media Research Foundation, at Personal Democracy Forum this year. And yet where are the pictures of the cyber crowd?
We worry about our social networkswhos following us, who are we following, how many likes am I getting, how many retweets did that getbut are we asking the right questions?
The Social Media Research Foundations project NodeXL displays maps of connections on Twitter in a unique way. By taking a topic or phrase and mapping out the connections in a network approach, we can see more than just who is talking to whom; we can see the communities that are being formed around particular issues. When we take a step back and see not just who the community is, but how its formed and what shape it takes, we can begin to ask deeper questions: Am I reaching who I want to reach? How can I reach that cluster of people over there? Do I want to reach that cluster of isolated people? The focus becomes less about numbers and more about the quality of the connections being made.
In the context of branding or marketing, there is obvious value to this: Am I growing my brand in the direction that it needs to? Am I getting my brand to the right communities, and which online leaders do I need to engage in order to do so? However, in the context of a social movement, the value is arguably more crucial. Social movements live and breathe online, but who analyzes the movement? Without the broad view of how a movement is shaped, it is left to grow or falter passively on its own.
NodeXL provides a tool for organizers and activists to see a movement, see who participated, and then see what kind of community has formed. Once you know what kind of community you have, you can look at ways to expand it, shape it, grow it, while mapping trends of the community over time. Collective action is difficult to cultivate and sustain; NodeXL provides a space to support action by asking questions like: Who are our main hubs? Which communities are talking about our issues, but not connected to the movement? How can we reach them? Do we have an active community or just a passive audience?
When answering these questions, we can streamline engagement processes and focus on the movement, not just the numbers.
Here is an example of a NodeXL network map, comparing the community around civictech in May to the community in June. As people reply and mention one another, they form links or ties that form communities, Smith explained. The civic tech network is predominantly a hub-and-spoke pattern, with a hub that gets repeated (or retweeted) by many others. A large volume of completely disconnected people are a major portion of the population. These isolates are mostly missing from these networks, but still contribute to the conversation. Some areas of the networks are dense, which represents a community of connected people, without a central hub, and many topic leaders.
Civictech, May 2015Civictech, June 2015
Overall, in May we see many hub-and-spoke clusters, such as the groups in G2, G5, and G6. This signifies audiences of people tweeting and retweeting from central groups of broadcasters, or mayors. But when we look at June, the clusters become denser. This signifies the audiences connecting to each other, rather than through central mayors, building a more dynamic community. We can also see clearer green lines (showing a direct connection) in May, and in June we see a more spread out series of lines, showing that more connections across communities were formed.
This change can largely be attributed to the Personal Democracy Forum being held, and is a good example of what a big, centralized event can do for a dispersed community, in terms of building relationships. Using NodeXL, we could see who became more connected to the community because of the conference, trace anyone who went from an isolate to a part of the community and vice versa. We can also see which new isolates entered the conversation, and over time with more comparative graphs, could see their growth in the community as well. This gives us the ability to know who to communicate with, and which mayors bring in more members of the community.
Having followers and retweets is important, but its only the surface level step. Numbers only get you so far, in order to understand how, why, and where you need to grow requires a network outlook. NodeXL, and the work Marc and the rest of the SMRF are doing, provides the tool to obtain and analyze that network.

During a Facebook Q&A yesterday, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took a question from the Huffington Posts Alex Howard about what policies she might support to help workers displaced by automation or fending with the uncertainties of the gig economy. Her answer, he notes, was pretty noncommittal, beyond saying that we have to resolve these questions while embracing the promise and potential of these new technologies and without stifling innovation or limiting the ability of working moms and veterans and young people to get ahead.


Ubers NYC general counsel Josh Mohrer wants a face-to-face live-streamed conversation with Mayor Bill de Blasio (so all New Yorkers can watch), but the mayor says I dont debate with private corporations, Gloria Pazmino reports for Capital NY.


Capital NYs Dana Rubinstein recaps the last few weeks of back-and-forth between Uber representatives and City Hall, uncovering enough miscommunication, fits of pique and contradictions to make clear that the current confrontation probably isnt what anyone actually wants, but laying a lot of blame at the Mayors feet. Two paradoxes that jump out of her story: Taxi Workers Alliance founder Bhairavi Desai, who is often at war with the traditional taxi industry over its exploitation of workers, backs the proposed cap on Ubers growth, but does so because what she fears most is how the job of taxi driver itself is becoming unsustainable. And, Rubinstein notes, while De Blasio is saying he wants to protect workers, one of his big tax donors, Evgeny Friedman, has been sued by the attorney general for mistreating his.


Nilay Patel of The Verge explains why we should rue the rush by Apple and Facebook to lure publishers into their mobile web: The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now.

Take data on who is being imprisoned in Illinois, and look back at their home addresses, estimate the cost per prisoner, add maps, and heres what you find: Five poor neighborhoods in Chicago have had more than $1.4 billion spent on incarcerating many of their residents from 2005-2009, this new study on the citys Million Dollar Blocks shows. 851 blocks have had more than $1 million spent on imprisoning residents, and 121 of those spent that much just to incarcerate people for non-violent drug offenses. The study builds on earlier work by Laura Kurgan of Columbia University that found a similar pattern in New York City.


Civic Eagle is an early stage mobile app that is hoping to engage ordinary Americans in the public conversation by using short video debates.

Over the weekend at Netroots Nation, activists with #BlackLivesMatter, the Dream Defenders, and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration interrupted the conferences presidential town hall session with candidates Martin OMalley and Bernie Sanders. As David Dayen reports for the New Republic, neither candidate rose to the occasion, presumably because they expected a traditional Democratic party event rather than a democratic power protest.


Netroots Nation, which was originally the Yearly Kos conference, has its roots in the unruly outsiders who crashed the gates of the Democratic establishment in the mid-2000s, but in recent years it has gotten much more professionalized, like a trade show for the liberal-left.

Heres De Blasio in Saturdays Daily News explaining how he sees the stakes in the Uber fight. He writes: When you consider whats at stakefrom ensuring workers can make a decent living, to managing the surge of more than 2,000 new cars on our streets every month, to protecting consumers from overcharges, to making sure we have more accessible vehicles for New Yorkers with disabilitiesits our responsibility to act.


One sign that the fight is escalating: Ubers chief strategist David Plouffe tweets last night: Things are not on the level at NYCs City Hall. Wasnt the City Council told this was all about congestion? Not anymore.

Its a lovely case study, but it reads as if NASA didnt do anything social or participatory until Twitter came along and a communications staffer, Veronica McGregor, made the spur of the moment decision to start an account for the Mars lander. In fact, as Jeanne Holm, who was then the agencys chief knowledge architect, once told me, it was the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster that showed NASA that it had a distributed network of volunteers (thousands helped collect and map the debris that landed across several states) and fans (the agency had just launched a new website and many people left heartfelt sympathy messages). Those realizations led to a wholesale shift in how NASA engages the public, the fruits of which we now see.

Many tech companies are reluctant to use their platforms directly for political purposes. Think of what it took for Google to decide to make its homepage go dark to protest SOPA/PIPA. Not so Uber, which has just added a DE BLASIO button for its app users in New York City that takes them to a page promising long delays on their service if New Yorks mayor and city council isnt stopped from putting a temporary cap on the number of new cars Uber can add to its base. As Bloomberg News notes, this isnt the first time the company has made such a move.


Heres the petition site that Uber is driving users to. The city council is expected to vote next week on the bill. According to the New York Times, Uber execs met with the mayor and other top officials this week and made clear that they wouldnt accept a higher cap, leading first deputy mayor Anthony Shorris to say that the companys opposition to regulation seemed like some kind of religious issue.


In the New York Times, Michael Barbaro and Ashley Parker trace how many of the presidential candidates, from Jeb Bush to Rand Paul to Hillary Clinton, are navigating the debate over Uber, and by extension, the changing nature of work today. The comments on Bushs post on LinkedIn yesterday attempting to position himself as a disruptive innovator suggest that he isnt in the best position, historically, to claim such a role for himself.


So far, claims by the leading presidential candidates that they are garnering huge grassroots support are not borne out by their actual small-donor fundraising, Kenneth Vogel and Tarini Parti report for Politico.


Less than 1/5 of Hillary Clintons campaign funds have come in amounts of $200 or less, the proverbial small-donor threshold, and the reason may well be this: fewer than 100,000 of the 2.5 million email addresses garnered by her 2008 campaign were still active, as Nicholas Confessore and Maggie Haberman report for the New York Times.


The countries of Georgia, Argentina, Costa Rica, and Mexico all score higher than the United States in terms of how stringently they regulate campaign finance, according to this new global analysis of 54 countries conducted by Global Integrity, the Sunlight Foundation and the Electoral Integrity Project.

Johnson thinks really solving the problem of email and Congress requires making software that helps Members of Congress receive and sort through their messages. Mill says that that burden is on Congress, and enabling more people to participate in communicating with their representatives is a good thing. Otherwise, one just ensures that Congress is never made uncomfortable. As Howard says, both men have a point.

Is a fast(er) track possible for government procurement of technology solutions? (David Fettig)

In my last Civicist post I talked about how public sector technology procurement was not well suited for the digital age.
But there are some efforts underway that seek to identify new methods of procuring technology solutions for government. As these ideas start to take hold, there is hope that those in the govtech community will create a set of strategies for more successfully implementing public sector technology solutions.
Designed to Fail?
The design of procurement policies that are used by our federal, state, and local governments are meant to encourage broad participation by requiring things like public announcements of solicitations, open vendor meetings, and fixed deadlines for submitting responses. The hope is to make the process as predictable and transparent as possible, and to level the playing field so that any qualified vendor can participate.
Procurement policies are also designed to mitigate risk and to ensure that selected vendors are competent and capable of undertaking the work required in government IT projects. It is important that these policies be consistent with the governments duty to be responsible stewards of public resources.
In light of this, there is a great irony in the outcomes that these policies often seem to produce.
Participation in government IT projects tends to be constrained to a subset of larger firms that regularly compete for contracts, while smaller, more nimble firms get squeezed out. In addition, the mechanisms meant to mitigate risk in government IT projects all too often seem to miss the mark in preventing technology projects from being delayed, going over budget, or failing altogether.
Clearly there is a need to redesign government IT procurement policies to more frequently produce the outcomes we desire.
In order to do this, goverment officials will be faced with some hard choices.
Time is of the Essence
One of the most common complaints about the current technology procurement process is simply that it takes too long. Interestingly, you can hear this complaint from both government officials and vendors.
The length of time it takes for the procurement process to finish is a particularly acute one for technology projects. Smaller firms which may be proficient in the latest platforms and development methodologies can get squeezed out simply because they do not have the resources or the institutional endurance to go through the process.
In addition, the technology landscape can change quickly with new ways of building powerful solutions emerging every day. Governments are often saddled with obsolete technology and long procurement cycles can exacerbate this problem.
Why does the public procurement process seem to take so long?
If we look closely, we can see that the specific design elements that have been engineered into the technology procurement process to support the goals of transparency and risk mitigation are almost always time intensive.
An abbreviated solicitation may mean less time to get the word out to prospective bidders, or complaints that not everyone was aware of a specific procurement opportunity. Utilizing a fixed schedule for vendor meetings, responding to questions about a solicitation, reviewing bids, and announcing a selected firm can sometimes take months.
Even after an award has been made, the process can take several months before work actually begins. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphiawhere I once workedfor technology projects, the period between a contract award (when a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of a contract (the beginning of actual work on the project) takes an average of four months.
This period of time is often used to review terms and conditions, legal stipulations, critical milestones and other issues that will govern the project as work gets doneall of which are meant to insulate the government from unforeseen risk.
So if time is the essential ingredient used to ensure that the procurement process is open and transparent, and also the primary tool used to ensure risk mitigation for governments then procurement reformers have some tough decisions to make. Reformersand government officialsmust either be willing to accept less openness and transparency (or, at least, the perception of it) and more risk for governments to expedite procurement cycles.
These dont seem like the kind of tradeoffs that will be palatable to policy makers. We need new techniques for promoting openness and diminishing risk in the technology procurement process.
Designing New Strategies
One of the entities developing new techniques for mitigating risk in the technology procurement process is 18F.
18F is a new group formed in the wake of the Presidential Innovation Fellow program within the General Services Administration (GSA). The organization, which focuses on bringing 21st Century digital practices to the federal agencies, takes its name from the location of GSAs offices in Washington D.C.,at the corner of 18th Street and F Street.
Earlier this year, 18F began work on a new process for agile technology services for federal agencies. Interestingly, in developing this new approach the group zeroed in on the time component of the procurement process and articulated how this can often be a detriment to efficient technology acquisitions:
The reality is that business priorities, user needs, and technologies evolve and emerge on a continual basis. To keep pace, software acquisitions need to move at the speed of agile development cycles. Ideally, this means less than four weeks from solicitation to contract kickoff, and from there no more than three months to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP).

One of the more interesting aspects of this new approach from 18F is that it employs a new technique to help mitigate risk. Participating vendors are required to show their work in advance to demonstrate competency:
Were requiring vendors to submit a working prototype based on a public dataset and show their work in a publicly available git repository. Were also requiring ourselves to adopt a rigorous evaluation methodology to ensure that the vendors can meet our needs.

This approach is similar to one that was tested by the City of Philadelphia in 2013, and its easy to see how it could be a much more effective way to mitigate risk in government technology projects. Requiring prospective vendors to submit an example of their work in a public git repository promotes transparency and provides and an advance view of the quality of their work. In addition, it can help ensure alignment with the agile principles that 18F is trying to implement.
Some have criticized this approach becausefor nowit is only available to vendors that are already on the federal Schedule 70 for IT services, and does not expand the universe of potential vendors to include firms that ordinarily might be shut out of the process. But I think this is exactly the kind of approach that is needed to redesign the way that governments procure technology services and solutions. The process of change has to begin somewhere, and as a first step 18Fs Agile Delivery BPA is impressive.
Though a relatively new organization, its worth noting that some have been more broadly critical of the efforts of 18F and have questioned the organizations potential for lasting impact. Most of this criticism tends to focus on a lack of tangible projects that the groupas yetcan point to as indicators of change to the way that federal agencies deploy technology solutions.
But as important as individual projects that can be listed in a press release are, it is equally important that this groupand others working within the federal governmentchange the culture and processes that have for so long hindered the way that agencies use technology.
If the Agile Delivery BPA is any indication, 18F is an organization that will have a fundamental and long-term impact on how the federal government does business.

Tobias Pfaff presenting DataLook's replication marathon at TEDx RheinMain

A year after launching DataLook, a Hacker News-style site highlighting data projects for social good, Tobias Pfaff and his colleagues are spearheading a 10-week replication marathon of some of the sites top reusable projects in advance of a TEDx competition they qualified for this spring. Participants are finding each other and collaborating on Slack, although if it makes more sense to take problem solving to outside sitesGithubs issue tracker, for examplethey are encouraged to do that as well.
I think there is not enough focus on replicating projects [in the civic tech community], founder Tobias Pfaff tells Civicist in a Skype interview. I think it might be less sexy to do things that other people have done before.
However, Pfaff also points out that replicating projects can be faster and easier than starting an open data project from scratch. Replication, he says, can be super sexy because you can get things doneand start having an impactquickly. He points Civicist to Jason Hibbets framework for civic hackers, which outlines three kinds of projects: green fields (new and untested); cloned (tested, approved, and repeated); and augmented (tested and improved upon).
One successful and much-discussed replication is the late U.S. Politwoops, a transparency project documenting politicians deleted tweets, which was based on a project first launched in the Netherlands in 2010. The service recently made headlines after Twitter pulled its API access for violating terms of service. However, other iterations of Politwoops continue to run smoothly in 30 other countries.
The first project replicated as part of DataLooks marathon was a Twitter bot that automatically posts information about animals up for adoption at local shelters. The person behind it, Slack user justnisdead, says that future replications would only take 15-30 minutes per bot.
DataLooks goal for the marathon is to demonstrate the impact that replication can have in just 10 weeks, and then to challenge the TEDx judges to imagine what they could accomplish if the marathon was extended to a year or more.
DataLook (originally Data for Good, until they found that name was already a registered trademark in the U.S.) was built during a startup weekend in Germany last year. It was always meant to be a home for replicable data for good projects, however in the year since Pfaff has found that the user base is really too small for a robust upvote/downvote-style site. There just isnt enough traffic.
(He speculated this might be because many of the major players in the civic tech sceneCode for America, for exampleare hosting many of these conversations in private or semi-private/branded spaces, and that others are spread out on various platforms like Reddit and DataTau.)
And yet Pfaff and his DataLook colleagues know many of the projects on the site are worth replicating. A month ago, Pfaff says, we went through our complete database and discussed which [projects] are really cool and which are reusable...[which solve] generic problems that appear in every city around the world and at the same time the code is open source. These are the projects they pulled out for a shortlist, and are actively encouraging data scientists to replicate during the marathon. The shortlist of projects includes Councilmatic; FixMyStreet; a food inspection forecasting app; Link-SF, a resource for homeless and low-income city residents; and more.
DataLook has asked encouraging interested parties to join an open Slack channel and find the projects that most interest them and connect with likeminded people. There are currently twenty or so members of the general DataLook channel.
Pfaff makes clear that the end of the marathon is not meant to be the end of replicating projects, but that the purpose of the marathon is to see what is possible within a given timeframe.
And then we can see what happens next, he adds.

By the way, all Clinton actually said in her economic speech, with reference to the sharing economy, was, as Josh Constine of Techcrunch notes, Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a spare room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on demand or so-called gig economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.

Hillary Clinton is going to criticize gig economy companies like Uber in a speech today outlining her economic policies, though precisely how tough she will be remains to be seen. An early report by Politicos Michael Grunwald led Techcrunch to headline its story Hillary Clinton Plans To Campaign Against Ubers Contractor Economy but after a clarification from the Clinton campaign to Politico, John Constine retitled his story Hillary Clinton Plans To Cite Ubers Contractor Economy For Dampening Wages.


However its headlined, Clintons stance on companies like Uber may become a hot potato. As Republican digital strategist and RNC senior advisor Mindy Finn tweeted this morning, Nothing says stuck in the past, economically speaking, like a rebuff of the sharing economy...This isnt 2008 anymore.


Sarah Kaplan reports for the Washington Post that Ellen Paos downfall as CEO of Reddit was intimately connected to her efforts to shut down five hate-filled subreddits and that the successful Change.org petition calling for her resignation was started over that issue, not her inelegant firing last week of Victoria Taylor, the moderator of the popular IamA section. She writes of Pao: To her admirers, she was an advocate for inclusion and a pioneering woman in a male-dominated field (only 11 percent of Silicon Valley executives are female and men are twice as likely to be Reddit users than women). To her detractors, she was shill for the social justice warriors who wanted to censor the site and a corporate outsider who was changing their community without bothering to understand it.

The new system cost about $4 million to build, and its annual maintenance cost is a little less than $1 million. (Emphasis added.

Bree Newsome removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, June 27

In just three weeks, the call to take the Confederate flag down from the grounds of South Carolinas capital went from a hashtag and an e-petition to conclusive legislative action. Last weeks vote by the state legislature was the result of many converging forces and trends: the rise of a new generation of Southern elected officials more attuned to the needs of global commerce than local tradition; the increasing sensitivity of many American corporate leaders to social issues; the frequently demonstrated capacity of modern social justice movements to attack and damage corporate brands using digitally-powered campaigns; and the emergence of a much more robust, youth-driven and leaderful civil rights movement powered by networked media.
Beneath the surface, a big shift is underway. Voices long ignored and issues long marginalized are forcing their way into the larger mainstream, changing the very meaning of what is mainstream in the process. And this isnt because the number of police killings of blacks has suddenly increased, or the number of state-sanctioned Confederate memorials suddenly jumped, producing more protest. The wounds of white supremacy in America remain as hurtful and unhealed as before today. But after more than a decade of life in the Networked Age, where open and connected media is almost ubiquitous, the long-standing imbalance in American public life around race and gender is inexorably being reset.
An almost hydraulic force is at work. In the same way that the underground water table punches through the earths surface wherever the ground gets more permeable, the undercurrents of Americas less powerful classes are finding their release through the new open media system fostered by the internet, even as they remain less visible on legacy media and in corporate suites. As Dante Barry, the co-founder and executive director of Million Hoodies for Justice said at Personal Democracy Forum a month ago, The open internet puts the pop in popular uprising. Popular uprisings require a platform that allow the many to speak to the many, all at once...the potential of the internet is in decentralizing who can drive governance in this country.
Online, we can see the surge. In 2012, the membership of Color of Change, the leading online organizing group focused on racial justice, grew by 4.8 percent; in 2013 it grew by 3.8 percent. In 2014, it grew a whopping 38 percent. Now, says its executive director Rashad Robinson, Color of Change has 1.3 million members, and not only are they more actively engaged than in the past, they are also giving more.
MoveOn.org, which has a much bigger and whiter membership base of around 8 million, reports that the two fastest growing petitions in its history, in terms of how quickly they hit half a million signatures, were their recent one responding to the Charleston massacre with a call to take down the Confederate flag across the state, and an earlier one from the NAACP that it elevated after the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon Martin killing. Close to one-third of the people who signed the post-Charleston petition were new to MoveOn.
Says Anna Galland, MoveOns executive director, It feels like the last two years is really one long civil rights momentwith Trayvon as the launch point. If I look at the combination of the Zimmerman petition and this (ongoing) moment around the confederate flag, weve added something like hundreds of thousands of new members around our work on civil rights.
She adds, Clearly our petition was building on years of organizing and advocacy and groundwork that was laid by groups including the NAACP and others. I see this as one of those moments where an online petition served as an important acceleratorthere was an opening, and the widespread outrage online absolutely helped encourage public officials like Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush and the Republican state legislators who promised to introduce legislation to take down the flag.
Behind the big vehicles of national online campaigns are a penumbra of smaller actions expanding all over the country. A scan of both groups platforms show literally hundreds of petitions on racial justice issues ranging from ending the veneration of Confederate symbols to demanding police accountability and economic opportunity. And Black Twitter is becoming a major force in nurturing these actions. As scholar Kimberly Ellis puts it, #BlackTwitter is here to stay and is only growing increasingly more powerful since its emergence in 2009, when the Pew Research Study chose to highlight this phenomenon of overrepresentation of Black usage of Twitter far beyond its representative population in the United States.
Broadening the Mainstream

To get a sense of how big a shift we are seeing, I spoke to two early African-American online activists, Chris Rabb, who ran the Afro-Netizen email list and blog from 1999 to 2009, and Cheryl Contee, the co-founder (with Baratunde Thurston) of Jack & Jill Politics, a political blog started in 2006 that joined forces with Elon James Whites This Week in Blackness in 2013. At its height, Afro-Netizen had about 10,000 people on its list-serve; Jack & Jill Politics hit about 600,000-700,000 monthly unique visitors at its height. While relatively small compared to the kinds of numbers we see today, both were vital early networking hubs for people of color hungry for meaningful political content online.
Years ago, Rabb told me that he didnt think African-Americans would take to social networking in the same way that white bloggers were, because they needed to feel safe in sharing their concerns online. And indeed, when Contee and Thurston started Jack & Jill Politics, they both chose pseudonyms (Jack Turner and Jill Tubman, referencing early abolitionists) because it really wasnt safe at all to be an outspoken black blogger. For Rabb that was somewhat less of a concern because he had a plethora of political connections on Capitol Hill, which in his words led to a virtuous circle of validation.
But those days are ending, Rabb and Contee both told me. More people of color with more perspectives are adding their voices to the fray in an individual manner, not requiring brands, like Afro-Netizen and Jack and Jill Politics, Rabb says. What mattered more [back then] was our individual networks. Sharing AfroNetizen content was far more labor intensive, he adds. Indeed, running Afro-Netizen was so time-consuming that when he started writing his book Invisible Capitalin part inspired by his own experience parlaying his connections into digital capitalhe set it aside.
What enabled me at least to stop using a pseudonym, Contee says, was the external validation we began to receive and seeing how large the community became. It became more difficult to represent and organize that community behind a pseudonym and I think others found that true as well. She adds, And while I and others like me have experienced some negativity and hacking online, no one has actually been killed or had their careers destroyed yet from speaking up online.
Rabb points out that the over-representation of African-Americans in terms of mobile phone use, texting and Twitter usage has contributed greatly to the shift. Now theres a critical mass of black folk where theres more of a sense of support, where your voice is not going to be the only voice. Theres some sense of protection and community that didnt exist ten years ago. Rashad Robinson of Color of Change agrees, but he puts it slightly differently: You can be engaged in debate and conversation [online] with people having your back. But its not so much about safety as it is about having power.
Contee and Rabb also both see a bigger culture change underway. Says Contee, The overall sophistication of users...during the six years in which we ran Jack and Jill Politics has increased dramatically. Its easy to see the impact of JJP and blogs like it in terms of the way that people talk online and present their opinionswith transparency, boldness, directness, irreverence with few sacred cows. Rabb concurs, noting, Now I see so many strong voices from people of color who arent necessarily mainstream which is great, and so the mainstream is broadening.  
Up to a point. Rabb, for one, said that he still thinks about when to share something publicly versus only sharing within his Facebook friends circle. When people express views that press against institutional racism or imperial capitalism, he notes, then theres a real chance of reprisals that can be symbolic, personal, political, and professional. He adds, Im still a black guy who travels and can be found on Google and I dont want to be killed.
It would also be a mistake to interpret the success of recent racial justice petitions on MoveOns platform as a sign that the larger white liberal community that it enfolds is ready for more systemic change. As Robinson admits, We test other issues, more systemic issues, with MoveOn members and they just dont perform well. They cant go deep on stop-and-frisk or systemic racism, he says of his MoveOn allies. He adds, speaking of the white liberal-left, #TakeItDown is a victory but are we any closer to those people talking about the funding model for public education? Or really pushing for voting rights legislation? Or addressing the funding models in our cities around criminal justice?
The question of what comes next as the symbolic power of Confederate culture melts down remains hanging in the air. On the one hand, its really a change when a Republican governor like Robert Bentley of Alabama preemptively orders his state to stop hoisting the Confederate flag and declares, A flag is not worth a job. (Recall the late George Bush adviser Lee Atwater, who memorably described the GOPs southern strategy as going from shouting n-r, n-r to more abstract stuff like states rights and cutting taxes, but with the same racist intention.) On the other hand, as Robinson points out, We win on the Confederate flag but then we have a bunch of really bad jobs for black people in the South. So were working on campaigns on Walmart and the auto plants in the South. 
To be sure, fights on economic issues are much harder than flag wars. But I cant help but think that, like the giant snow farm still sitting in Bostons Seaport District, the residue of last winters massive snowfalls, white America is melting slowly into the ground. Theres a hard core of ice up there in Boston that is still frozen solid, and its even got its own micro-climate that keeps refreezing some of the water coming off the top of the heap. But the mass is breaking down, and so are some of the hardest ingrained symbols of white supremacy in America.
To be honest, I never thought Id live to see Southern states like South Carolina and Alabama move to officially discard their Confederate flags. And yet, the day is here.

Lead slide of "Upworthy's Editorial Vision"

Since launching in 2012, Upworthy has done a few things very well.
Upworthy perfected the socially-optimized curiosity gap headline. This was both a blessing and a cursethe site attracts around 20 million unique visitors per month, but it is synonymous with clickbait, an image they havent quite been able to shake even after shifting away from those thoroughly unloved headlines.
Upworthy mastered curating the webfinding high-quality content with bad headlines, then tinkering with the framing to give it better headlines and help it find an audience. That has been Upworthys niche for the past three years. But thats changed now that Amy OLeary, formerly of the New York Times, has taken the helm as Editorial Director. Now, Upworthy is producing its own 5,000 word articles about the fast food industry. Its staffers are called editors instead of curators. This week, OLeary released a new report on Upworthys Editorial Vision, which helps to define this pivot in Upworthys content strategy.
As the company transitions to content creation, its worth asking what makes Upworthy different. Equating Upworthy with clickbait has always obscured the real secret to their success.
It isnt the clickbait headlines. Plenty of imitators picked up on Upworthys rhetorical stylings, leading Peter Koechley to announce sorry we kind of broke the internet last year at The Guardians 2015 Changing Media Summit. In fact, Upworthy has been moving away from you wont believe what happened next-style headlines for years. They started using those headlines because they tested well. Then everyone else started using the same headlines. Then users got tired of them. So they didnt test so well anymore, and Upworthys style shifted.
In fact, clickbait doesnt do justice to Upworthys viral model. The point of Upworthy was never to maximize clicks. It was to maximize shares. If people click on a headline and are disappointed with what they find, they generate a single page-view. (Thats nice if you have an advertising-based business model. Upworthy doesnt, and never has). If people click on the headline and like what they find, then theyre more likely to share that piece of content through Facebook and Twitter. And thats how the audience grows and progressive messages break out of their Filter Bubbles.
It isnt Facebook optimization. Facebook is the main driver of online news traffic today. Companies used to focus on search engine optimization, reasoning that the way people find anything new online is through google searches. Today, companies focus more on social optimization, recognizing that the balance of online power has shifted. But Facebook can be a cruel master. Tweaks to the Facebook algorithm can send your traffic plummeting. If you are too successful at generating traffic through Facebook, the site might just decide to duplicate your model and bring that traffic in-house.
It isnt the content itself. Part of what has made Upworthy different from its copycats is the focus on substantive content with a progressive bent. Upworthy, so to speak, is people. Hiring the right curators with the right taste and judgment has been a core element of finding and shepherding share-worthy social content. But that content has always come from mining the web. All of Upworthys top hits have come from some other media producer.
No, what makes Upworthy special is their approach to analytics. Tracking the right data, thinking about data, and using data correctly has always been the thing they get more right than anyone else.
Analytics was at the core of their initial launch. Eli Pariser and his team realized that simple A/B headline testing (the same type of testing that hed done for years as Executive Director of MoveOn) could help build a massive audience for important stories that simply had never been framed right.
Analytics was what drove them to clickbait. (Except it was actually sharebait.)
And then analytics was what drove them away from clickbait. In February 2014, Upworthy stopped focusing on pageviews and unique visitors and started focusing on attention minutes.  
The switch from pageviews to attention minutes is emblematic of what sets Upworthy apart from its competitors. Everyone uses some form of analytics these days. Its relatively simple to measure pageviews, clicks, retweets, and shares. Analytics is basically how we keep score in modern-day journalism.
But all this digital data can easily lead you astray, particularly if youre measuring the wrong thing. Optimizing for pageviews leads to a bunch of stupid slideshows. Optimizing for clicks leads to curiosity-gap headlines, regardless of the story they link to. Optimizing for fundraising leads to an endless string of dire warnings.
Take a look at slides 17-20 in OLearys slide deck. Upworthy has spent a year and a half gathering rich data on attention minutes from tens of millions of visitors. Thats data they have and their copycats dont. And now theyre starting to use that data for their own storytelling. Whatever happens next, theyll monitor, listen, and learn, and adapt.
The hard part of the new digital journalism isnt the math or the software code that drives analytics and A/B testing. The hard part is figuring out what the right metrics are. Focus on the easy stuff and youll create a powerful engine driving you inevitably towards irrelevance. The center of Upworthys big pivot is a focus on the hard parts of analytics. That focus drove them to be the social webs biggest curators. Now it will drive them as the social webs latest content creators.

This March saw the launch of a web application that makes it easy for victims of predatory colleges to request student debt forgiveness from the Department of Education. For the first time ever, debtors were able to exercise their right to apply for student debt cancellation on their mobile phones. More than 300 applications flowed in that first week. But this website wasnt built by the government; it was built by volunteers with the Debt Collective, including myself, in less than a month. The Secretary of Education Arne Duncan frequently touts the virtues of tech, but in so far as modernizing how the agency actually helps current and former college students, the heavy-lifting has been forced onto the backs of students, debtors, and volunteers.
The Need
As the total college student debt burden reaches $1.3 trillion, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street called Strike Debt found that tuition-free education at all public two- and four-year colleges could be achieved with just $15 billion in new spending. Meanwhile, the government is expected to profit from student debt repayments to the tune of $127 billion over the next ten years. To make matters worse, student loans are unique from other kinds of household debt in that they cannot be discharged by bankruptcy. They are nearly impossible to get out from under, even in the most dire of circumstances. With these revelations, it seems true that some or all of this debt is morally illegitimate, and action is needed to give relief to these debtors.
One of the only existing safety nets for millions of student debtors is the Higher Education Act, which gives the Department of Education authority to cancel debt when a school violates state law. But for many years the Departments website had little to no information on how to dispute debt, let alone an online application to do so. The process was an uphill, seemingly impossible battle for debtors. That is, it was until this year, when a small group of volunteers at the Debt Collective decided to do something radical: the governments job.
For years, hundreds of thousands of students have found themselves scammed by predatory for-profit colleges. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., was one of the largest and most notorious of these chains. It was clear from multiple government actions and investigations, dating as early as 2007, that Corinthian was rife with deceptive and unfair business practicesfrom false job placement statistics, securities fraud, to the unlawful use of military seals in advertisements. Despite this, the Department of Education continued to collect on the debt of scammed students, students Secretary Duncan admitted left Corinthian Colleges in a worse position than when they started.
After months of watching the Department of Education do nothing, while hearing story after story of lives ruined by unpayable debt, our team at the Debt Collective decided to make a move. With help from some amazing lawyers, we began to craft a process to dispute students debt. Law student Luke Herrine spent hours coordinating our strategy with a team of legal experts, creating a multi-page application form that affected and eligible debtors would need to fill out by hand. In the form, each debtor needed to cite the specific legalese appropriate for their state. It wasnt even clear that the Department would recognize the forms as legitimateno one had ever done this sort of thing at scale before, and the Department had little-to-no information on their website. With an entirely paper-based and manual method, our first, ambitious goal was to submit 50 applicationsone for each state.
The Application
As the Facebook groups for former Corinthian students grew larger, it became clear that the goal of 50 Defense to Repayment applications was not enough. We wanted to dispute the debt for as many debtors as possible.
Karissa McKelvey (left) and Ange Tran (Photo courtesy Karissa McKelvey)
Designer Ange Tran suggested we make a wizardan application that walks debtors through each section of the long legal form. Tran had previously created a similar solution to automate sending letters for pro-solar policy advocacy in New York State. But years later, with a solid tech team and a large group of debtors in solidarity, our new application could take the concept further with mobile-first validated design, data-driven progress dashboards, and secure data storage. It needed to be built fast, tooas every day without a submission system meant another day of financial hardship and debt collector harassment for hundreds of thousands of debtors.
Our online form had to enable a debtor to submit a variety of information about themselves: sensitive data, such as their social security number, birthdate, and address; state law(s) broken by the school that would fall under the Defense to Repayment provision (that changed based upon the state the student had lived in); and supporting materials, such as their story or evidence of abuses. Making people fill out a PDF directly using Acrobat would lead to a substantially lower conversion rate. Many dont have access to a desktop or laptop computer, become overwhelmed by long forms, or have limited time with their busy schedules.
The website had to be easy to readcheckboxes needed to hide away complicated legalese, replaced automatically using a spreadsheet of related paragraphs. Data had to be transferred over a secure, encrypted channel (https) with the completed forms accessible through only one secure administrator account to protect the privacy of debtors. With a conveniently-timed lull in funding for my day job, I began developing the back end system and overseeing the technical architecture, working with Tran, Herrine, and our front end developer and designer Zach Greene.
We released the prototype to the public on March 25 after four weeks of research, design, and development. Within a week, the Debt Collective received over 300 applications (over 2000 to date). Herrine printed out hundreds of applications by hand and delivered them to the Department of Education with representatives from the Corinthian strikers. (When we asked the Department if we could send claims by email, they said no, they would have to be printed and submitted on paper.) Although the Debt Collective continued to submit applications on the behalf of debtors over the next few weeks, the Department of Education remained silent. We wondered if they were overwhelmed by the volume of forms.
The Response
Finally, after two weeks, the Department of Education announced that they would consider the discharge of some students debt. This was a major victory for those affected, but also led to a tremendous revelation about the limits of the Department. They maintain that most debtors must still submit forms individually to prove their injury. A select group of 40,000 Heald students can submit to a fast track process, and need only complete an attestation form. But, laughably, the form only works in Adobe Acrobatnot on smartphones or other PDF programs. No wonder only 180 of the 40,000 eligible students have completed the form so far!
The Department of Education loves certain applications of technology. In April, Secretary Duncan published a piece on Medium.com on the importance of expanding the role of technology in the classroom. And they have an entire Office of Innovation and Improvement that provides grants for education innovation. But when it comes to making conned students aware of their rights to even seek debt discharges, and providing means for them to apply for that discharge, the Departments technology is essentially nonexistent. If we could fashion a superior solution with a rag-tag, mostly-volunteer crew in two weeks and get the word out to thousands of students, why cant a government agency with billions in funding do the same?
Despite the vast amount of money, human resources, and technical knowledge the Department possesses, it still does not have an automated process to discharge the debts of all Corinthiansor any studentsat once. The governments failure to build technology may be one of intentional neglect, to erect barriers to legal processes to which we are entitled. There are resources the Department could use inside and outside of the government, such as 18F and Code for America, to build superior technology that better connect the data warehouses that track past, current, and future students and their familys finances. But so far this hasnt happened. Unfortunately, this is not a technical problem but a political problem. The onus of bad debt is placed onto the individuals who took the debt, not on the corporations that profit. And right now the Departments technological priorities reflect that attitude.
Weve proved that something as simple as a PDF generator and mobile-first web front end can radically affect the landscape of education policy, but theres still a lot of work left to do. We plan on extending the current application to work for all student debtors from multiple colleges, not just the Corinthian chain.
As a Bay Area techie, Ive heard more times than I can count that we are somehow changing the worldand usually I find it offensive. The tech community is rich with stories of startup-driven disruption that upends the status quo in a particular sector, without attention immediate needs within the political-economic climate. The fetishization of disruption that changes the world overlooks relatively simple efforts, aggrandizing those that affect more fundamental functions of the economy or the technology that runs it. But as government technology waxes and wanes, startups fail, and bubbles pop, we must dare to askwhat if the best things we can do in civic tech arent the most complex, cutting-edge, or innovative technological feats, but rather ones that are attuned to real needs on the ground and made in dialogue with grassroots communities and activists? Technology alone cant change the world, but when technological is employed strategically by social movements, it can certainly help us do so.

Civic HackingCivic TechDirect Action 



In May, Civic Hall hosted a conversation on whether the time has come for a universal basic income. The event featured a panel of experts with diverse backgrounds: Peter Barnes, co-founder of Working Assets/CREDO and the author of With Liberty and Dividends for All; Michael Lewis, a professor at the Silberman School of Social Work; Nathan Schneider, journalist and author of Thank You, Anarchy: Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse; and Albert Wenger, a partner at Union Square Ventures (USV), a New York-based early stage VC firm. The panel was moderated by Natalie Foster, a fellow at the Institute for the Future and co-founder of Peers.org.

The conversation ranged all over the place, from the reasons we need a basic income now (robots! climate change! to save democracy!), to the ways it could be made a reality (redistribution of existing public assistance! Reddit!), to the places it is already at work (Alaska! No, really, Alaska!). One thing that is clear is that universal basic income doesnt have to be a one size fits all countries solution: just because this European country does it this way doesnt mean the U.S. has to do it that way. In fact, in some of the possible solutions the panelists put forward, the government doesnt have to get involved at all. As Nathan Schneider concluded, Maybe the question is not so much whether to do basic income, but how. 
What follows are a few excerpts from their conversation, and you can listen to the full audio here:
Michael Lewis defines the basic income
The way I think about it is that a persons income, their starting income, whether or not they work, doesnt have to be zero. Like right now we think that people, that most of us who are able-bodied, able-minded, we get our income from work. Or if were kids, we get our income from those who take care of us, our caretakers. But a basic income is just an income that you get from the government, financedit can be financed in various ways Im sure well talk about, right? But it will come from the government, and the way I think about it is imagine that weI think you probably have an idea what social security is, right? Thats the one for the elderly, right? Imagine that program expanded to everyone, right? So its not just for the elderly, but its like social security for everyone, and so you get it whether youre elderly, young, old, whatever.
Theres some minimum income you get periodically whether or not you work, whether or not youre a good person.

You get it unconditionally just by virtue of being a resident in someI mean some say citizen. I prefer resident. You get that whether or not you do the right thing in life, so you just get that as a guarantee and its really social security expanded to everyone. Thats how I think about it.
Albert Wenger on the robots coming for our jobs and why the time has come for a universal basic income
At Union Square Ventures, we recently invested in a company that does image recognition. A notoriously difficult task, figuring out whats in an image. Something we think we as humans are good at. And again, it was one of those problems that like no progress, no progress, no progress, and then all of a sudden in the last couple of years, machines are better at recognizing faces than humans. So I think the reason this is a pertinent discussion now is because many human activities that people currently get paid for, currently are the source of their livelihood, that let them pay for rent, that let them pay for clothing, that let them feed their kids, et cetera, many of these activities will be executed better by machines. And whats important to keep in mind is it doesnt matter, its not an idea of machines taking over of these jobs overnight.
What matters is on the margin, when somebody makes a hiring decision, whats the marginal substitute? Prices in markets get determined on the margin. So wage pressure will start the second you can substitute, not when everybody has been substituted. I think thats really, really important to understand.

Peter Barnes on Alaska and benefitting from the commons
So here is an example in the United States, in a red conservative frontier state, where everybody who is a resident of Alaska gets a dividend every year, no questions asked, just the way Michael was describing. The eligibility is you have to have been a resident of Alaska for one year or more. Children are included, so a family of four gets four dividend checks.
Now, this idea of a permanent fund was invented by a Republican governor in the 1970s, and most of the governors of Alaska since then have also been Republicans and they love this idea.
Everybody in Alaska, whatever your party, loves getting dividend checks.

Now, where does the money come from? This is the question. In Alaska it comes from oil, which is kind of a unique situation because theyve got all this oil and not very many people and so the math works out very well. But underneath that is a concept that there are certain kinds of wealth that belong to everybody equally. In Alaskas case, its oil. And if you compare how Alaska treated its oil wealth to how countries all over the world have treated their oil wealth, youve got to agree that Alaska has done the best thing with oil wealth of any country in the world.
So my concept, which is written up in this book With Liberty and Dividends for All, is to take that Alaska model and blow it up, cover all 50 states, every American, probably, like Michael said, legal residents, not citizens, because then you get into a lot of other issues which its best not to get into. But basically, if youre living in America legally, you should get a dividend that comes from wealth that belongs to all of us. Now, to make this work at a national level and not just in one state with a lot of oil, youve got to think a little more broadly about what other kinds of wealth actually belong to everybody.
Alaska Permanent Fund, annual dividend payouts since 1982
Nathan Schneider on why techies could get behind this

In the tech community, the appeal often seems to be kind of encapsulated in a term used by a blogger in Silicon Valley, Steve Randy Waldman. He talks about VC for the people, right? Its a kind of innovation dividend. It gives the opportunity for more people to do more tinkering, right? And so for the world view in which more tinkering is the best possible thing, because it will mean more technology, more things to invest in, more opportunities for creating a more convenient life maybe, basic income is a means to that end. It would enable more people to maybe spend more time in those garages.
...and how some people on Reddit already have
Another approach that is just starting to emerge and I think is interesting to put on the table is one that doesnt involve government at all. And this is the idea that maybe we can just create basic income ourselves in a kind of entrepreneurial way. A lot of the examples of this kind are coming from the world of people who are interested in bitcoin-like crypto currencies, money that can seemingly come out of cyberspace that can appear and, through adoption and use, become more valuable.

So people are thinking, okay, what do we do with this money that possible can come out of thin air, and how do we get lots of people to use this money? Well actually, basic income is a very good way of solving both of those problems. And so a number of people, many of whom are organizing themselves on Reddit, have been experimenting with different ways of getting this going. And actually, there are a couple of different models that are actually being implemented now where you can actually get tiny little amounts of bitcoin just for signing up. And these systems tend to be opt-in. You know, so its not something everyone with a social security number is getting. Its something where everyone who wants to be part of this gets it. And that on the one hand offers a bit of freedom, right, where you only buy in to the system or enter the system if you really want to. You dont need the government coercion to do it. But on the other hand, it creates kind of the specter of the sea-steading states, the designer states off in the ocean, where the rules are made by some kind of benevolent or not so benevolent dictator, and if you play by those rules, you get your basic income and maybe if you dont, you dont.

Do not miss Alvaro Bedoyas article in Slate warning how tech industry opposition to new privacy measures is leading to the creation of the Loophole of Things. In it, Bedoya, who is the founding executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law, explains why he was one of several consumer privacy advocates who two weeks ago walked out of Commerce Department-sponsored talks with industry groups that were trying to set up voluntary rules for companies using facial recognition technology. He warns:
As checks strengthen on government surveillance, tech companies are evading even basic limits on their ability to collect, share, and monetize your data. At the heart of this divide is an increasingly formidable force: industry lobbying. Facial recognition lets companies identify you by name, from far away, and in secret. Theres little you can do to stop it.


Bedoya says that consumer privacy advocates are seeking a basic opt-in rule for the use of facial recognition, but industry lobbyists wont touch it. Worse, this is part of a broader pattern of industry lobbying that is shutting down Washingtons ability to protect consumer privacy.

Two of Ubers top Europe execs, including their France CEO, were taken into custody in Paris yesterday and charged with running illegal taxi operations and concealing documents, TechCrunchs Romain Dillet reports. While the main Uber service is legal in France, its uberPOP service, which enables nonprofessional drivers to offer rides to passengers, is not.


Uber NYC is offering free uberPOOL rides to City Hall today between 10:30am and 2:30pm to steer people to a rally opposing legislation that it says would ban new drivers from joining the company. As Joe Tacopino reports for the New York Post, the City Councils Transportation Committee is considering legislation calling for a study on how ride services are affecting congestion, and it would lead call for a cap on adding new cars while that study is performed.


Reviewing the rise of Uber (and its detractors) in the New Yorker, longtime tech journalist Om Malik makes an important point about what is often called the sharing economy....it often isnt really about sharing. It is an economy driven by our desire for instant gratification. And in an age where we now carry tools for such gratification in our pockets, he suggests that the protests of traditional taxi drivers wont be able to hold back the changed expectations of their customers.


Ubers senior VP of policy and strategy, David Plouffe, tells Caroline Fairchild, the new economy editor of LinkedIn, that every month our driver population becomes more and more part time. I think in the future you might see people driving for Uber just on their commute....Uber and ride-sharing and add to the existing ecosystem. We serve a lot of underserved areas that were sort of transportation deserts. What flows from that is you can help reduce emissions and congestion and you can help get carpooling at scale to work which is something that has eluded the world for decades.


In Bloomberg View, Justin Fox argues that Ubers army of lobbyists are serving the publics interest in having more convenient ways of getting around.


Taking the opposite view, Adam Greenfield argues that Uber represents the rise of a particularly noxious version of smart city ideology that should be resisted.

Without ever quite calling it Black Twitter, the New York Times Michael Barbaro and Jonathan Martin do a pretty solid job of describing how the online efforts of that influential network have influenced the sudden shift in how South Carolina politicians are approaching the debate over the Confederate flag. On Twitter, they note, the debate was not even close. About 77 percent of those mentioning the issue favored the flags removal, 20 percent expressed neutrality and 3 percent defended its place on the capitol grounds, according to Two.42 solutions, a company that analyzes data and opinion.

On the one hand, Parker admirably urges hacker philanthropists to avoid creating their own bureaucracies, to make big bets, to be ready to be political, and to try to be humble about the odds of success. On the other hand, he gives us this: Perhaps if [Andrew Carnegie] had lived to see the internet, he would have funded Wikipedia instead.

When we talk about the challenges that face governments in acquiring and implementing new technology, the conversation eventually winds around to the procurement process.
Thats when things usually get ugly. Its broken, they say. It just doesnt work.
What most people who care about this issue fail to recognize, however, is that while the procurement process for technology may not work well for governments or prospective vendors (particularly smaller, younger companies), it is not broken.
It works exactly as it was designed to work.
Squeezing out the little guys
If youre looking for a detailed account of what the government procurement process looks like from the perspective of a small startup, there is an interesting article in VentureBeat that gives the account of TallyVoting, a voting technology startup that is closing down after trying to penetrate the government market.
Here are some specific criticisms raised by the team behind TallyVoting.
The process moves too slowly:
Governments move slowly compared to regular industry. Compared to the tech sector, government moves at a glacial pace. Selling stuffnot just technologyto government requires sourcing leads, submitting proposals and counter-proposals, securing external certification, periods for official and public comments, and thats just the tip of the iceberg of process.

The process is too costly and complex, particularly for smaller firms:
That long sales cycle doesnt give a small bootstrapped startup a chance to demonstrate the potential of its concept and technology. (Unsurprisingly, the already-giant vendors with a stronghold on the market are more than able to handle this long cycle. Theyre also more interested in profits than improvements and innovation.) It also doesnt give the little startups the opportunity to show traction and product-market fit.

These are fair criticisms, but in discussing them we often make the mistake of assuming that they are unintended problems that arise through some general disfunction of government.
These issues are not accidental, and its time we reframe the discussion around procurement reform accordingly.
The procurement process is too costly and complex
The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that its current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering desired outcomes.
Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualitiesno one would argue that these requirements are adopted in the hopes of fostering positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants.
This is true, even if the positive outcomes are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for. Much like with our tax system, the added complexity borne by all participants doesnt guarantee the intended results.
Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion. Much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms to build or acquire technology.
Requirements like proposal and performance bonds, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth), to name just a few, are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they rely on a vendor.
In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources. However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesnt seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of technology projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process.
Ive heard representatives of smaller firms argue that the bond industry doesnt have a good understanding of how to underwrite technology projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result? Many smaller firms that are well qualified to do the work may choose to simply walk away from the process. This is true even if these bond provisions dont lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of larger technology projects.
Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants can not guarantee the intended results.
A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large projectparticularly technology projectsis to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully. Fortunately, we are starting to see this happen at the federal level with the creation of the U.S. Digital Service.
The procurement process moves too slowly
While this seems particularly acute in the procurement process, this is also a fair criticism of government in general.
We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process; much of this is by design. But long procurement and budget cycles can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that dont provide a return for months on end.
There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and rules that ensure all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to actually begin work.
An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can take to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.
Some things we can do to make procurement better
With all of this in mind, here are, in no particular order, five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.
Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement
Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP. In the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process. When I worked in Philly, we had some success in using these smaller projects to test new ideas and strategies for partnering with small local vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.
Identify clear standards for projects
Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic technology and data standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:

The various components that a system will use
The environment in which it will be housed
The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance

...can go a long way to reduce the risk of uncertainty inherent in technology projects.
Its worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of standards that are usually made part of any technology solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date and they must undergo constant review and refinement.
In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard.
Require open source
Requiring technology projects to be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.
Im not suggesting that every vendor needs to open source their entire platform, but if governments are contracting with outside companies to build new, custom software solutionsand there are no security or other considerations that would make it impracticalthen why not make them open source?
Government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source toolsleveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active communityto foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments make the code behind their project open source, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.
Develop internal capacity for IT project management and implementation
Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing, and managing technology projects.
Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government (particularly at the state and local level) with hands-on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.
Governments need to find ways to develop a maker culture within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities.
Make contracting, lobbying, and campaign contribution data public as open data
One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the many postmortem reviews of the healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying. Its a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.
This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firmswho lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officialsto simply throw up their hands and walk away.
In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and contributions to political campaigns is open.
Ensuring that all participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possibleincluding small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices.
None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near termthese are items that I personally think are important and very achievable.
But its time for us to stop pretending that the problems with government technology procurement are an accident.
If were going to fix things, we need to design a better system.

Rhinobird uses WebRTC, an open source project that enables Real-Time Communications (RTC). All a potential user needs to get started broadcasting or viewing is a WebRTC-enabled internet browser.
The focus of this is really to open the live TV sector, Heusser tells Civicist. To reduce the barrier to producing or distributing TV.
The one hiccup, Heusser acknowledges, is having to build an iOS-specific app, which he says is in the works but not yet completed.
Rhinobird makes it easy to get multiple perspectives on the same event(s) through channels created around hashtags. When streaming something tagged #timessquare, other streams with the same tag appear at the bottom of the screen.
Unlike his competitors, Heussers funding comes from the Knight Foundation, not venture capitalists. The project that eventually became Rhinobird.tv won the Knight News Challenge in 2012.
Heusser was inspired to build the platform in 2011, when student-led protests filled the streets in Santiago, Chile. Although many demonstrations were peaceful, the media covered what violence there was to the exclusion of everything else. To show the world the real picture, Heusser attached a camera to helium-filled balloons and sent it flying into the air. The video was livestreamed via Twitcasting and garnered more than 10,000 viewers during the 40-minute feed.
That spurred him along the path to Rhinobird. When asked about the name, Heusser explains that it refers to the symbiotic relationship between a rhinoceros and the birds that perch on its back, eating ticks. A rhinoceros will defend its territory, but with its bad eyesight the animal often depends on the bird to sound the alarm. This collaborative behavior is what Heusser wants Rhinobird.tv to be about: peer-to-peer broadcasting that increases the diversity of media and enriches the commons.
Scenes of summer in the city will be livestreaming starting today on Rhinobird.tv.

While recent security breaches like the hack of the Office of Personnel Management show this remains a serious problem, this complaint is a bit rich coming from the former Florida governor, who bragged about releasing a trove of emails from his governorship and then later had to scramble to remove tons of personally identifying information of thousands of ordinary citizens he communicated with.

He adds:
There is a cadre of young folks, native to the Internet, who Get It. They are infused with a spirit of play, they assume collaboration, they like to push against edges, and they are aware of the challenges the openness of the Internet faces. I do not believe this culture is going to vanish. In fact, it is thriving in some of the most important sites on the web. For example, Reddit at its best not only takes advantage of the freedom the Internet gives us, it takes it as a topic. The Internets spirit lives in the hackathons and the engineering culture that has come to dominate the mainstream. It even lives at sites like YouTube where, in a fully corporately-owned space, people make things to delight one another.

As digital technologies continue to reduce barriers to entry for civic participation there are numerous opportunities for more inclusive governance in democracies. However, understanding the opportunities for engaging citizens also requires understanding a multi-sector approach to governance across public institutions, civil society, and everyday people. In a new policy paper, part of the Data-Smart City Solutions series from the Ash Center at Harvard Kennedy School, I outline a schema for multi-stakeholder governance and provide several examplesfrom engaging citizens as co-producers of public goods through civic crowdfunding to providing direct feedback to inform municipal policyof ways we can build civic muscles.
More Inclusive Governance in the Digital Age
Working toward inclusive governance takes a multi-stakeholder model. Government cannotand should notdo it alone. It is not as simple as providing the opportunities for citizens to engage in collaborative decision-making. Rather, citizens have become accustomed to a weak model of engagementdemocratic elections every four years that hardly express the accurate will of the people. And these are the democracies.
Digital tools offer the promise of a re-engaged civic sphere. However, they have failed to live up to their potential. The reality, shaped by people, power, and institutions, is much more nuanced. However, there are opportunities for using digital tools to create more inclusive and collaborative structures for governance.

On Friday, WikiLeaks began publishing 70,000 documents from a trove of more than half a million cables and other material from inside the Saudi Arabian foreign ministry and other state agencies. The files appear to have been obtained by a group calling itself the Yemeni Cyber Army. Many of the early findings center on how the Saudi government curries favor with media outlets around the world, in part by buying hundreds or thousands of subscriptions in selected publications.


Writing in the Washington Post, Middle East expert Marc Lynch says, it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of these leaks. They are likely to matter more than many of the previous such leaks because of how they resonate with two of the most potent issues in todays Middle East: the regional proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran; and fierce Arab regime efforts to control an inexorably expanding Arab public sphere and erase the gains of the 2010-2011 uprisings.

On a warm Saturday afternoon in April, a mother perched on the steps of a public library with her two children, holding an iPad. I want to do the last one, one of the kids said. Wait, the woman replied, Ill tell you what to push. On the sidewalk in front of the library stood the local city council member, Brad Lander, pitching people as they walked by: Want to help decide how to spend one million dollars? It was one of the last days to vote in New York Citys fourth year running participatory budgeting, but for the first time people could vote on a laptop or iPad.
Participatory budgeting is the practice, originating in Brazil, of letting community residents decide how municipal funds should be allocated in their neighborhood. In New York City, it is an almost year-long process, beginning with the development of proposals in the fall, followed by a consultation with city agencies on budget and feasibility in the winter, and finally voting on projects in the spring. The participatory budgeting vote is a far more inclusive process than local elections: Immigration status is of no import, as long as the person is a resident of the council district in which they vote, and, depending on the district, residents as young as 14 or 16 can participate. This year, New Yorks fourth, more than 51,000 people voted on how to spend $32 million dollars on capital projects.
The level of engagement and enthusiasm in this years Participatory Budgeting process was unprecedented and deeply democratic, Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said in a public statement. Across the city, thousands of residents of all ages and backgrounds came together to make their neighborhoods a better place to call home. Participatory Budgeting breaks down barriers that New Yorkers may face at the pollsincluding youth, income status, English-language proficiency and citizenship statusresulting in a civic dialogue that is truly inclusive and representative of the diversity of this community and this city.

There is also more space for innovation in the participatory budgeting process than in regular elections, which made it possible to test digital ballots and experimental interfaces in five of the 24 city council districts that ran a participatory budgeting vote this year (of 51 total districts). To make the digital ballot a reality, the city partnered with Stanford Universitys Crowdsourced Democracy Team and Democracy 2.1, an international project to change community decision-making. The Stanford team led the development of the digital ballot, consulting with Democracy 2.1 and the city on the user interface, and Democracy 2.1 led the ballot implementation during the vote in April. (Full disclosure: Democracy 2.1 is an organizational member of Civic Hall.)
Make it as easy as an ATMthat was our goal, says Lex Paulson, a professor of political theory at Sciences Po-Paris and an international counselor at Democracy 2.1. At the core of the Democracy 2.1 project is a voting algorithm developed by a mathematician and anti-corruption activist, Karel Janecek, that privileges consensus over majority-wins.
Deploying the digital ballot in New York City this spring was an opportunity to test some of the alternative ways of voting developed by Janecek and the Stanford team. In each of the five districts where the digital ballot was piloted, participants were asked to vote on an experimental ballot after their real vote had been cast.
The digital version of the actual ballot, with instructions on how to vote and descriptions of each project. (Democracy 2.1)
On the actual ballot, voters were asked to select five projects, regardless of size or cost, no more, no less. In contrast:
One of the experimental ballots tried to solve the knapsack problem, a mathematical problem of combinatorial optimization. In laymans terms, that means getting the most bang for your buck. This experimental ballot allowed voters to choose up to one million dollars worth of projects. Unlike the actual ballot, which restricted voters to no more than five projects, this allows voters to choose many more projects, because they find they have space for smaller budget items left over after choosing big ticket items.
Lex Paulson says this can give arts projects an edge, since they usually have small budgetary needs but, because they are seen as inessential (as opposed to installing air conditioning in a school cafeteria), are less likely to be among a pick of just five projects.
When people vote they should see the same trade-off that a city planner sees, says Ashish Goel, who leads the Crowdsourced Democracy Team. We spoke in April at a voting site on the Upper East Side.
Our design principle, Goel said, [is] how to build for people so they can make the best decision possible.
A second variation of that ballot allowed people to choose up to two million dollars worth of projects, even though the budget was less than that. Giving people more options raises the likelihood that someone will pick a winning project, a key factor in Democracy 2.1s satisfaction index, a metric that they developed to assess the success and impact of democratic processes.
Our premise is that the higher the percentage of voters who end up supporting a winner, the greater the level of consensus and satisfaction with the process will be, Paulson explains. Our argumentwhich our pilot data from 2015 is continuing to strengthenis that the D21 voting system, through the effect of more votes per voter, is the most efficient way to maximize overall satisfaction with any democratic process.
One of the other experimental ballots gave voters down votes in addition to up votes, which allows the city to see which projects are the most divisive or controversial. Another ballot showed voters randomized pairs of projects, and the voter had to decide which of the two projects they would prefer to fund.
The results from the up votes/down votes ballot. Those further to the left are where there is most consensus, and those on the right are divisive and/or unpopular. (Democracy 2.1)
During a brown bag lunch at Civic Hall last week, Paulson explained the many benefits of using a digital ballot, in addition to increased opportunities for experimentation and innovation.
To start, digital is mobile. Staff and volunteers were able to take iPads into parks, to go where the people are instead of expecting them to come to the voting site.
Digital ballots can also be more information-rich than paper. Its easier to add visual elements, and the ballot this year could be translated into Chinese and Spanish. The New York Times reported that in one district last year, two-thirds of the ballots were cast in Spanish and Chinese. While printing foreign language ballots is possible, going digital means that you dont have to guess at how many to print and risk having too many or too few in a particular language.
While were on the subject, digital ballots save trees and ink. Fewer paper ballots also means fewer votes need to be hand-processed; digital means getting real-time results.
Digital ballots also allow for project order randomization. Studies have shown that the placement of a proposal at the top of the ballot improves the likelihood that the proposal will be funded. Although printed ballots are all identical, digital ballots, when randomized, can eliminate that small placement bias.
This year, Democracy 2.1 and Crowdsourced Democracy Team only got involved in the final stage of the participatory budgeting process, the vote. However, they will be involved from the beginning in next years process, which will begin in the fall.
Lex Paulson hopes to experiment using the Democracy 2.1 platform as a deliberative tool in the proposal stage of the process, not just a decision-making tool.
Sondra Youdelman, the executive director of Community Voices Heard, a community organization dedicated to making civic processes more inclusive, tells Civicist that she would like to take a look at the statistics gathered from the voter survey to identify areas with underrepresented communities. Community Voices Heard has been integral to developing New Yorks participatory budgeting process since it launched three years ago.
I mentioned to Lex and the group that I actually like the idea of having iPads and having people go out in the community and get people to vote if its targeted properly, Youdelman explains. Her concern is that digital ballots, without additional outreach in underrepresented communities, could further increase the civic engagement divide in the city.
This year, in advance of the idea-generating phase of participatory budgeting, Community Voices Heard sent canvassers to knock on 4,000 doors in public housing buildings to poll people on the projects they would like to see proposed, and ask if anyone would want to be a delegate in the participatory budgeting process. The cards that those polled filled out had to be entered in by hand. A digital ballot, deployed properly, could make this process faster and more information-rich.
Its one of many possible engagement processes that the city could upgrade, so to speak, with a digital ballot.
Well have a longer runway to experiment this year, Lex Paulson tells Civicist. And council members say they want to do more.

A bipartisan working group led by heavy-hitters from recent Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns, chaired by the Annenberg Public Policy Centers Kathleen Hall Jamieson, has issued a major 47-page report chock-a-block with recommendations for increasing the value and viewership of presidential general election debates, arguing they need to be updated to take into account the rise of early voting, the ubiquity of social media, the spread of alternative media networks, changes in campaign financing, and the increase in independent voters. Heres my quick take.


In other news, National Journals Shane Goldmacher offers an excellent soup-to-nuts catalog of the many ways presidential campaigns are trying to take advantage of Facebooks unrivaled advertising and targeting opportunities. He writes: 
Thanks to powerful new features unveiled since the 2012 campaign, Facebook now offers a far more customized and sophisticated splicing of the American electorate. And, for the first time in presidential politics, it can serve up video to those thinly targeted sets of people. That unprecedented combination is inching campaigns closer to the Holy Grail of political advertising: the emotional impact of television delivered at an almost atomized, individual level. It makes the old talk of micro-targeting soccer moms and NASCAR dads sound quaint.


Derek Willis of the New York Times Upshot section notes that Jeb Bush, who just formally announced his candidacy, has being doing little to build a robust online presence.


Digital strategist Mike Connery took a close look at the websites of 25 top think tanks, and what he found probably wont surprise you: The vast majority arent making full use of social media sharing or embedding of their data. And yes, think tanks still love to post their content in .pdf files. We have yet to see the emergence of a true, digitally native think tank, he writes, offering a range of innovative ideas worth studying. He also shares this tidbit from the World Bank:

In an analysis of their own PDF reports conducted last year, the World Bank found that 1/3 of all reports published in PDF format by the bank had never been downloaded. Fewer than 13 percent had been downloaded more than 250 times, making PDF filesthe dominant format think tanks use to present informationalmost wholly ineffective in helping think tanks achieve their goals.


Sam Gustin of Vices Motherboard takes a close look at the potential rise of the internet voter, building on conversations he tracked while attending Personal Democracy Forum earlier this month.


Michael Cornfield of George Washington University took seven of his grad students to PDF, and in this post he explains why belonging to the civic community is essential to innovating successfully.


Saving face? Nine major civil liberties and consumer advocate groups have withdrawn from ongoing talks with trade associations over facial recognition technology regulations because they couldnt achieve a minimum goal of insuring that companies would first seek and obtain permission from people before employing such techniques to identify them in public, Natasha Singer reports for the New York Times.


Meanwhile, as privacy scholar Kate Crawford helpfully points out on Twitter, companies sell facial recognition software for churches to track people attending services.


Thirteen years after legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security included a provision creating the National Emergency Technology Guard, FEMA is finally signing agreements with major tech companies setting up the service, Jeff Mapes reports for The Oregonian. The service, which was inspired by our own Andrew Rasiej, who helped organize industry volunteers after 9/11 to help rebuild digital services near Ground Zero, was championed in Congress for more than a decade by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR).

This morning, a bipartisan working group led by heavy-hitters from recent Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns, chaired by Annenberg Public Policy Centers Kathleen Hall Jamieson, issued a major 47-page report chock-a-block with recommendations for increasing the value and viewership of presidential general election debates, arguing they need to be updated to take into account the rise of early voting, the ubiquity of social media, the spread of alternative media networks, changes in campaign financing and the increase in independent voters.
Opening up debates to more meaningful participation by the public has been a concern of ours going back many years, to the experiments we did with 10Questions.com in 2008 and 2010. (See our past coverage here.) Political debates play a key role in informing voters and putting issues on the public agenda. But despite the rise of real-time networked communications, the only role for voters in most debates is as random question-askers and audience backdrops. So, this new effort by Jamieson and the Annenberg working group merits serious attention.
Democratizing the Debates makes several interesting recommendations, including adopting new formats that reduce the role of the TV anchor/performer/journalist moderator and increasing direct dialogue between the candidates, letting the media have free access to the debate TV feed so other channels and services can show it and add their own approaches to how it is used, giving social media platforms a role in framing topics and questions, getting rid of the live audience except during the town-hall debate, and making the secretive process of debate negotiation between the major candidates more transparent. These are all valuable suggestions.
This recommendation for increasing public participation in particular gets my hearty endorsement: 
The debates should employ a more formal process of soliciting topics and questions both from the general public through a variety of platforms as well as from a broad group of knowledgeable experts that would include print as well as broadcast journalists....We believe that a full third of the questions by the moderator in the debate should be obtained from non-news sources. On an individual level, this change gives voters and politically interested Americans greater opportunity to shape the debates. Involving the audience, however, demands participation that enhances the debate viewing experience. Audience participation should be much more than a novelty  it should contribute to the greater dialogue and provide a meaningful way to participate. Moreover, audience participation has the potential to help direct conversation and reaction before and after the debate and in the process increase interest.

Likewise, its heartening to see the Annenberg group call for shrinking the debate spectacle, eliminating the spin room, the audience, the beer tents, and the locked-down university campusall of which, it argues, add to the cost of the events (driving the need for private sponsors) and distracting from its main purpose. Notably, the group says that Twitter has made Spin Alley into a tired ritual. (Paging Jay Rosen!)

Intriguingly, the report suggests the adoption of a high-tech tool invented in 1883 known as a chess clock, wherein each candidate gets an equal amount of speaking time and to take control of the floor, a candidate simply hits the chess clock. While this innovation could force the candidates into more direct dialogue, somehow I dont see risk-averse presidential candidates ever agreeing to try it. (Though just think: it would enable the viewing public to evaluate their facility in pressing the button, which is a presidential skill that candidates have not previously been tested on.)
But where the Annenberg group is most disappointing is on the central issue of who gets into the debates. Citing polling showing the 56 percent of the public want to make it easier for third-party candidates to participate in these debates, the working group suggested some minor modifications to do so, such as lowering the polling threshold from 15 percent to 10 percent for the first debate, but failed to achieve an overall consensus on how to seriously address this public concern. (As all of the members of the working group make their livings from working on campaigns for Democrats or Republicans its hard to see how they could have possibly made any other decision.)
Taken together, the Annenberg working groups reforms would likely have the effect of increasing viewership of these seminal events, which have an aura of importance far greater than their actual effect on election outcomes, as political scientists like John Sides remind us. The debates do play an agenda-setting role, both in explicitly affirming certain subjects as key issues facing the country, and in implicitly affirming the two-party duopoly as the only legitimate vehicle for addressing those issues. Sadly, the working group does not call for the replacement of the Presidential Debates Commission by a genuinely independent body, like the League of Women Voters, which used to sponsor presidential debates and still plays an important role convening lower-level political debates. And thus, even if many of its more creative ideas were adopted, it remains hard to see how they would actually democratize the debates if the meaning of the word democratize is to actually be of, by and for the people.
Were going to be launching a project soon looking at how political debates not just in the United States but around the world are being transformed by interactive technologies and related approaches, so keep an eye on this space. More soon!

Civic EngagementElection 2016Rethinking Debates 





(Lars Plougmann, CC BY-SA 2.0)

This is the second installment of three pieces on the business of civic tech and how we should be rethinking that business. You can find Sean McDonalds first piece here.
Trust in institutions, globally, is at an all-time low. Government, business, journalism, and even nonprofits, are all losing the publics faith. The U.S. government, in particular, has hovered near its lowest approval ratings in history for an uncomfortably long time. And, given recent history, its hard to blame us.
One reason is that were using the same organizational models weve used for decades. The way that we legally structure organizations (Corporations, 501(c)3s, Limited Liability Companies, etc.) defines their incentives, values, decision-making structures, and priorities. Incorporation models are the DNA of organizationseven those with revolutionary approaches to collective actionand that DNA replicates the same structural flaws and risks as traditional organizations. We are trying to build the future with the same organizational structures that gave us the present andas Einstein said, We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them. Its fair to say that decision making structures are, collectively, how we think.
Amidst the global fallout in trust, there are many trying to build technological solutions to our trust deficitboth better verification and trustless systems. The most recent (and, arguably, credible) technology solution is the blockchainthe distributed administration and ledger architectures made famous by Bitcoin. The blockchain offers a huge amount of potentialin particular, it decentralizes administration (and administration costs), improves transparency (for those capable of understanding it), and increases the reliability of complex interactions. As a way to contextualize blockchains potential impact on the ecosystem and evolution of technology adoption, Nick Grossmans Venture capital vs. community capital, is a great overview.
However, as Rachel ODwyers The Revolution Will (not) Be Decentralized: Blockchains points outthe primary challenges in collective action, while interesting technologically, still come down to mediating relationships, managing governance structures, and being able to set common standards. Blockchains create huge opportunities to transparently design and manage distributed processes, but they dont enable us to evolve norms, resolve disputes arising from the transactions they administer, or meaningfully solve the definitional issues that lie at the core of our representative governance models (more on those here). To take the inverse of the law cannot solve technologys problems, tropewe cant expect technology to solve our organizational problems. 
One of our most challenging organizational problems is how to balance the financial needs of information channels and the integrity of the information and relationships the channels represent. Publishing platforms make it even more complicatedthey use their content and engagement structures to claim and monetize our behavior and relationships. The majority of privately owned platformseven well intentioned onessell some form of access to users, data, services, and servantsall of which distorts the integrity of the underlying relationships. As respected, anonymous cybersecurity expert @SwiftonSecurity tweeted recently:
The problem with freeware monetization is that there is no informed consent. It is inherently and unavoidably abusive to the least capable.
 SecuriTay (@SwiftOnSecurity) June 15, 2015

And thats where it gets really concerningthe more civic groups and governments rely on commercial technologies as intermediaries, the more potential there is to strain or distort the already struggling trust relationships between the public and institutions. As Erica R.H. Fuchs noted in a research paper about DARPA, institutions that develop technology require embedded network governance, meaning that the network should have an built-in role in making decisions. According to Fuchs, that means more than just technologyit includes bridging the policy, business, and legal implications of technology. That, as Stanfords Lucy Bernholz notes, means not only changing what civil society groups do, it means changing how they work. 
So. How do we build trust in organizations? More importantly, how do we make organizations more trustworthy? Im a big believer in progress through open, participatory processes. Still, theyre big questions that will require a lot of experimentation to answer. Finding socially conscious ways and spaces to experiment will be incredibly important, especially in an intellectual property climate that allows companies to own the ways that we engage with each other. A fundamental part of building trust in those organizations will involve ensuring that the underlying ideas that redefine collective engagement dont disappear or irreparably change when the companies that build them do. And, like most forms of both collective action and technology, well probably end up with more than one answer.
One answer of how to build those socially conscious, safe spaces may be a new approach to an old structure: the Civic Trust*. Traditionally, trusts are privately created legal agreements that create systems of management and governance over a particular set of assets, according to a set of values or desired goals. Trusts also create a legally enforceable fiduciary duty to the beneficiary, which can be defined when theyre created. For a broad overview of Trusts, this article from Findlaw is helpful. 
The use of Trusts to protect a set of common resources or values isnt new. Natural resources are often donated to governments through Public Trusts, which can set standards around the maintenance and care of that resource. Similarly, many Trusts are created to ensure the integrity and sustainability of institutionsin his recent farewell to readers, the Guardians Alan Rusbridger cited how important the Scott Family Trust has been in helping maintain the newspapers independence. Similarly, in this article, Keith Porcaro lays out an incredibly smart approach to how Trusts could be used to protect user interests in the use of their data. Even venture capitalists form trusts to manage risk. But, in their present form, Trustslike almost every other incorporation modelfocus on specific inputs (resources, financial investment, votes) and less well-defined outputs (conservation, independence, profit, democracy). 
Thats where a Civic Trust are different. Civic Trusts focus on ensuring that transparent and meaningful participation processes are built into the way that technology products evolve. As most social platforms prove, well designed engagement processes are resourcesand in publicly supported technology design, how theyre governed matters. 
Heres how it works: A Civic Trust would be created by an organization that wants to be able to make meaningful guarantees to protect its users and customers. The Civic Trust would create an independent organization that owns the code and data resources created by the creator, using limited, revocable licenses to give for-profits, nonprofits, and governments the right to use, adapt, and sell products based on the underlying code. These licenses would give the Civic Trust the ability to audit and ensure that basic standards of participation were met in the way both the technology and organizations evolved (things like rate of versioning, feature development, security defaults, dispute resolution processes, data use, etc.). As opposed to focusing on the value of the outcomes, Civic Trusts would focus on the values embedded in the decision making processes of the user organizations. 
This approach isnt without precedent. Civic Trusts work the same way that Apple and Google are structured, except that instead of using the structure to avoid taxes, it would use it to build and steward truly open and participatory governance processes (in technology). Civic Trusts could create safe spaces to experiment with governance and decision making processes, hardcoding a public advocate into the organizational DNA of the companies and technologies that connect us. Civic Trusts would help us define embedded network governance in the public interest.
My next post will dive into the nitty gritty of a Civic Trust, including sample contractual provisions and ideas. At its core, though, Civic Trusts are a recognition of the importance of ingraining participation in public interest technologies. Ultimately, we have yet to figure out how to design organizations that can balance the public interest with the expectations and requirements of their fundersas Paul Klein notes, even nonprofits struggle.
While Im sure that there are many who disagree, that disagreement is exactly why we need Civic Trusts. We dont have to agree, but we need the space to experiment and disagree in public. After all, as long as we, the public, invest in privately owned platformswith our time, data, money, or anything else of valuewe should have a meaningful voice about how they treat us, grow, and change. Otherwise, who would trust them?

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, whose outsider presidential campaign is polling at 32 percent in New Hampshire (compared to 44 percent for Hillary Clinton), tells the Daily Beasts Eleanor Clift, I have a lot of respect and admiration for Barack Obama, but the biggest mistake he made after running one of the great campaigns in American history was saying to the legions of people who supported him, Thank you very much for electing me, Ill take it from here. Sanders added, I will not make that mistake.


In The Intercept, Jon Schwartz reminds readers how Marshall Ganz, one of the key architects of Obamas grassroots organizing strategy in 2008, came to criticize Obama for demobilizing the army that elected him. (For some deeper background on that story, heres my 2009 techPresident piece on The Obama Disconnect.)

Kelly McBride, the vice president at the Poynter Institute, meditates in a New York Times op-ed on when it is OK to pay for a story, focusing in particular on the bounty WikiLeaks is raising to entice someone to leak the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The job of journalism in a democracy is to exercise scrutiny to hold power accountable, McBride writes. Given the TPPs secrecy, WikiLeaks crowd-sourced leak-funding campaign, which has raised about $56,000 to date, can be seen as a logical response to a process designed to thwart public debate, an investment in democracy even.

Nancy Lublin speaking at PDF15.

I spent last Thursday and Friday in New York City at the Personal Democracy Forum and left with three big questions to ponder.
1) How do we make apps more civic? Andrew Rasiej quoted Nick Grossman in a session saying, We dont need more civic apps, we need apps to be more civic. Rather than creating a neighborhood-organizing applications, how do we get Airbnb to introduce neighbors to each other; enlist Uber to provide free rides to the polls on Election Day; or analyze Twitter to inform politicians of constituent sentiment?
2) What happens when the public square becomes private? Millennials increasingly use social networks to communicate with friends, get their news, and build businesses. But private companies own these immense social networks.  They can restrict access at any momentpotentially eliminating David Troys incredible maps of online social networks or the Sunlight Foundations Politwoops tool, to name just two examples.
3) Does the nonprofit model work for civic tech? Nancy Lublin told a powerful story about the challenges she faced to take the Crisis Text Line from an idea to its incredible success processing 6.7 million messages, and how her team struggled to gain funding from foundations. In contrast, Jim Gilliam, the CEO of NationBuilder spoke to an audience with Change.org lanyards hanging around their necks about the benefits of having both Andreessen Horowitz and the Omidyar Network behind the company and their for-profit model.
Andrew Rasiej and Micah L. Sifry have created something special with the Personal Democracy Forum and it is an important convening of the civic tech community that luckily answers many more questions than it raises.

Home of an Italian Ragpicker (Jacob Riis, public domain via Preus museum)
On the first morning of Personal Democracy Forum, Micah Sifry shared a more than 100-year-old image by Jacob Riis from a series titled How the Other Half Lives. Riis, who was equal parts photographer and social reformer, created the series to call attention to the deplorable living conditions in the tenement housing system. Sifrys interlude was followed by talks by Eric Liu, on reckoning with power and positionality, as well as Jess Kutch and Palak Shah on re-envisioning labor movements for the 21st century. All the while, Riis image remained in my minds eye, and got me thinking about all those who should be considered todays Jacob Riis.
Is it the Chinese activists sharing images on Weibo that contradict official history?
Or Joao Silva, whose long journalistic career has included chronicling the end of apartheid, the War on Terror, and human rights abuses in the Balkans, to name just a few of his subjects.
Riis surely would have approved of the efforts of the International Bar Association, which has just unveiled an Android app to help human rights activists document and store images until they are shown in court. The idea behind the application is to time-stamp and affix GPS-determined location to each uploaded image, verify the image, and protect the safety of those brave enough to record them.
Maybe Riis latest inheritor is the 15-year-old  bystander who filmed this weekends police violence against black teens in McKinney, Texas. Brandon Brooks video of a police officer holding down a bikini-clad teen and waving his rifle at two of her male peers has been shared around the world in a matter of days.
Of course, it doesnt really matter who fills Riis shoes. The more people photographing truth to power, the better.
Another PDF speaker, Harold Feld, reminded us that the net is an undeniable public utility. Moments before that, Dante Berry pointed out that over 100 million Americans lacked reliable internet service. Merely having internet access or a camera isnt enough. Today, just as it did in Riis era, what matters most is what we do after the images are captured. Will we share, question, organize and culture-hack around them, or will we let the agenda and power be set by someone else?

Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced yesterday that the department would forgive the loans of many students who attended the now-bankrupt for-profit Corinthian Colleges, a seeming victory for the Debt Collective, which organized hundreds of students to go on a debt strike seeking relief.

In response to Duncan, the Debt Collective issued a statement criticizing the department for forcing students into a complicated process for discharging their debts instead of immediately and automatically ending them. Students are entitled to receive full relief under law, the statement said. The legal and most painless possible process for students is no processthey deserve an automatic discharge of their debts. More than 1,200 students have now joined in pledging to strike their own loans unless the department issues a class-wide cancellation of the Corinthian debts.

What I heard loud and clear was a direct ask for help, for all of us white and black, to plant seeds, start and nurture engaging each other.

This year, many of the speakers at Personal Democracy Forum challenged us to rethink the cultural design of our systems, not simply the technical. Deanna Zandt asked us to Imagine All The Feelz and consider how we might create space for personal truths, even the painful ones, in our social media discourse. And in Public Engagement is Broken: Are You Part of the Problem? Catherine Bracy suggested that, instead of building a new social network, we redesign the public meeting from a space for contentious bickering to a space for productive dialogue.
The truth is, the culture of a system determines its success. We need systems that are comfortable with the notion that they are not perfect. We need systems that acknowledge that we are always learning, that we improve over time. We need systems built on a culture of ongoing improvement, not fixed outcomes. We see this learning culture across many disciplines, from agile development in tech to continuous improvement in education. The core logic at the heart of all of these successful systems is that of the growth mindset, a philosophical stance first identified by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. 
A fixed mindset assumes our qualities of character and intelligence are set at one inherent level, and there is little to be done to change them. Some of us are smart, some of us are dumb, and we play the hand were dealt. A growth mindset assumes that our intelligence and abilities are dynamic, and that we can improve our skill levels through practice. Our capacity is directly related to our effort. Carol Dweck finds that fixed mindset students are mainly motivated to look smart all the time and never look dumb. Growth mindset students are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks, and look at challenges as opportunities for growth.
What will happen if we adopt the growth mindset as the culture of our civic engagement systems? We can reframe our failures as opportunities to learn. We can contextualize data as a means to an end. We can embed accountability as a stepping stone to progress. We can meet people where theyre currently at and create opportunities for deeper participation over time. Our systems will incentivize participation, because participation will create improvement.
Tristan Harris broke down what happens when we use a fixed outcomes approach to designing our systems in his PDF talk, called Constantly Distracted? Design for Time Well Spent. Using a fixed volume metric like time spent has lead to product features like the Facebook Timeline, which encourages passive content consumption. The Facebook Timeline has had a profound impact on how we spend our time on the internet, reducing active participation by omission. What if we measure mindful engagement, as Tristan advocates? What if, as he suggests, we use positive impact on human well-being as a measure of our success instead of time spent? Using our metrics to track what we value gives us a concrete pathway to deliver on growth mindset-based design.
Last year I founded a social systems design lab called Thicket. From its inception, weve focused on creating a space for people to think and work together to solve our most entrenched systemic problems. Throughout the process of designing our community-powered research and design platform launching this summer, our team has been motivated by this question: How might we instill the growth mindset in our product design? We think weve done pretty well, but in the spirit of continuous improvement, we can do even better.
Coming to PDF this year as a Civic Hall Fellow has been an invigorating reminder that there is a strong, motivated, energized community of thinkers, designers and technologists who believe that our systems can truly be better, and are putting in the effort to make them so. If we can channel that spirit of dynamic improvement into all of our systems, I believe we will have successfully created the conditions for greater civic engagement.

We shouldnt get internet-of-things things that are broken out of the box. (Opensource.com CC BY-SA 2.0)
Congress has made a lot of mistakes governing the internet over the years. But the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), enacted in 1998, stands above the pack as one of the worst. The age of digital rights management (DRM) it made possible was bad enough in the realm of music and video media. But as manufacturers prepare to extend this regime to a world of connected things, were on the cusp of a colossal mistake.
This is, at least according to Cory Doctorow. Speaking at Personal Democracy Forum 2015 on Thursday, he criticized the extension of the ink jet business model to the internet of things. Do we really want to have to pay a subscription fee to the manufacturer of every connected device in our home to keep it from shutting down? Especially in a future where life as we know it might not be possible when connected systems fail to keep our homes, cars, and offices cooled, connected, safe, and clean.
Doctorows position draws much of its strength from the ethos of the maker movementthat such schemes result in products that are fundamentally broken out of the box, and only the valiant, repeated (and usually successful) efforts of hackers to jailbreak them can restore the balance of power between manufacturer and consumer.
Doctorow is fighting an important campaign. Even since I saw the DRM chair, a concept design created by some Swiss students in 2013 that would self-destruct after eight uses, Ive worried about the coupling of smart infrastructure and these kinds of metering and access control systems.
But I think that things get murkier when the discussion turns to security. Doctorow launched into a scathing critique of the awful provisions of the DMCA that inhibit research on vulnerabilities in DRM schemesit isnt just a crime to distribute cracks to rights management encryption, its also a crime to distribute any information about potential vulnerabilities. These restrictions have created enormous obstacles to serious and valid academic research.
Now lets map this over to the internet of things. Now I may be wrong, but its one thing for Disney and Sony to stop free culture hacktivists from cracking DVDs; its a whole other game if Siemens and GE are stopping engineering professors from exposing holes in the firewall on my power plant. Seeing this in the cards, earlier this year, Doctorow and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched the Apollo 1201 project (after Section 1201 of the DMCA), which aims to eradicate DRM everywhere.
The problem though, is that the consequences of security flaws on the internet of things are much, much higher than anything we faced in the age of Napster. But there arent any truly viable schemes for securing the internet of things on the table yet. With a proliferating array of devices, tucked away in every corner of our pockets, our homes, and our cities, with firmware becoming obsolete at various rates, and being probed constantly by an unseen mass of miscreants around the worldeven as they sense our most private activities and pull the levers on our most critical infrastructuresthis is not something to be taken lightly. If DRM is a part of the toolkit that allows internet of things businesses to bring their products to market in a profitable and responsible manner, despite all of these challenges, we shouldnt immediately throw out the baby with the bathwater because it didnt work out the last time around.
No one likes the way DRM currently treats users when they try toscrutinize and fix its security vulnerabilitiesto essentiallyconsider you as much as an enemy as it would an actual intruder.
But my hunch is that the battle over when fighting DRM does and doesnt make sense in the internet of things is going to be a lot more complicated than the picture Doctorow paints.
But simply extending the DMCA, crafted in the 1990s by media industry insiders, to the realm of connected objects makes no sense at all. The real question we ought to be asking is, how can we fix the DMCA to make the internet of things work for us instead of against us?

Its the second day of Personal Democracy Forum 2015 and you can still catch the livestream beginning at 9am EST.


Microsofts Bay Area Staff drafted a quick post on how to tell if Personal Democracy Forum is for you, concluding that This years PDF is for everyone.


Miranda Neubauer digs up all the relevant-to-PDF civic tech and govtech happenings in New York City for Capital New York.


For a quick overview of yesterdays main stage talks, Jeff Swift has pulled together a Storify for Part One, Part Two, and Part Three.


For Civicist, Lauren Mobertz, a Mozilla fellow at the conference, shares five takeaways from the breakout session on labs for social and economic empowerment.


Yesterday, during his main stage talk, Jim Gilliam launched a book with the same title as his PDF talk in 2011, The Internet Is My Religion. NationBuilder has the Storify.


Zeynep Tufekci takes to the opinion pages of the New York Times to ask Mark Zuckerberg to make users Facebooks customer. Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, seems to have plenty of money, she writes, but Id like to give him some of mine. I want to pay a small fee for the right to keep my information private and to be able to hear from the people I wantnot the sponsored-content makers I want to avoid. I want to be a customer, not a product.


Also in the New York Times Opinion section: Edward Snowden, writing on the two-year anniversary of the publications of stories based on NSA documents he provided.


During Tristan Harriss PDF talk on Time Well Spent, yesterday, he cited a mechanism from Couchsurfing that tracked net good times as a design for time well spent. Nithin Coca respectfully disagreed, and pointed to an article he wrote for The Kernel in May on the improbable rise and fall of Couchsurfing.


For Foreign Policy, Thomas Carothers asks why technology hasnt delivered more democracy, and six experts weigh in: Martin Tisne, of the Omidyar Network; Larry Diamond, of the Hoover Institution and Stanford University; Senem Aydin Duzgit, of Istanbul Bilgi University; Rakesh Rajani, of the Ford Foundation; Diane de Gramont, a student at Yale University; and Golnaz Esfandiari, of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe.


Thomas Carothers provides a TL;DR: The contributors answers to the puzzle of why the advance of new communication technologies in the past fifteen years has not produced any overall advance of democracy in the world boil down to three different lines: First, its too soon to see the full effects. Second, the positive potential effects are being partially outweighed or limited by other factors, including some larger countervailing trends on the international political stage for democracy, the ability of authoritarian governments to use the same technologies for their own anti-democratic purposes, and the only partial reach of these technologies in many countries. And third, technology does not solve some basic challenges of democracy building, above all, stirring citizens to engage in collective action and the establishment of effective representative institutions. Sounds like theyre on the same page as most PDF15 attendees.


The Gawker Media Staff decided to unionize. The next steps, they write, are determining what we want to bargain for; forming a bargaining committee; and negotiating a contract. You know, the easy stuff!


The President of the Sunlight Foundation, Christopher Gates, has written a eulogy for Politwoops. The key grafs: 
Days after Politwoops launched in 2012, Twitter contacted the Sunlight Foundation and told us, Your service violates our API Terms of Service on a fundamental level. We explained the goals of the project and agreed to create a human curation workflow to ensure that the site screened out corrected low-value tweets like typos, links and Twitter handles. We implemented this layer of journalistic judgment with blessings from Twitter and the site continued.
We are truly mystified as to what prompted the change of heart, and its deeply disappointing to see Twitter kill a project they had supported since 2012. It is also disturbing to us that our feed was cut almost three weeks ago and our only direct communication came from Twitter last night, when we were told that their decision was not something that we could appeal, and, most surprisingly, they were not interested in reviewing any of the email conversation from 2012.Clearly, something changedand were not likely to ever know what it was.

Left to right: Ibrahim Abdul Matin, Palak Shah, Jess Kutch, and Hannah Calhoon (Lauren Mobertz)
With panelists Palak Shah (Fair Care Labs), Jess Kutch (Coworker.org), Hannah Calhoon (Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood), and moderator Ibrahim Abdul Matin (Green Deen: What Islam Teaches About Protecting the Planet), day one of PDF15 saw an enormous sharing of learnings around using technology and new forms of worker engagement to bring about economic justice. Here are five quick takeaways from Thursdays breakout session on labs for social and economic empowerment.
1. Labs are essential
For civic tech hackers to produce social solutions ready to enter the free market, were going to need labsspaces where new ventures aiming for positive social change can not only test new ideas, but pass on the knowledge of their failures.
2. We need a new form of organizing
The decline in collective bargaining has opened space for a new form of worker organizing. This is a space where technology has the potential to create enormous value, as weve already seen with tools like Coworker.org, DemocracyOS, and more.
3. Technology is not replacing unions
Rather than replace unions, new technologies can complement existing labor organizations and even ease workers into the idea of organizing. A great example of this is a group of bike share workers that voted to unionize after running a successful campaign for better working conditions on Coworker.org. In other cases, unions have used Coworker.org as a tool for their organizing.
4. Profitability: the biggest hurdle for civic tech?
As all of todays panelists attested to, preparing civic tech teams to create market-based solutions that can survive without government funding or philanthropy is quite the challenge. The panel left us with an important question to ponder: How will civic tech applications of the future drive enough revenue to sustain their activities?
5. Moderator Ibrahim Abdul-Matin is a cruel but benevolent dictator
Our group couldnt have covered as much ground or had half as many laughs without your guidance and willingness to cut us off. Thanks, Ibrahim!

Personal Democracy Media and Civic Hall are pleased to announce the publication of the book A Lever and a Place to Stand: How Civic Tech Can Move the World, a collection of articles about civic tech and engagement by Rebecca Chao, Denise Cheng, Allison Fine, Alexander B. Howard, Matt Leighninger, Jessica McKenzie, Eilis ONeill, Sam Roudman, and Micah L. Sifry. Copies will be available for purchase at Personal Democracy Forum, or you can order your paperback or ebook online.


Today is the first day of Personal Democracy Forum! Follow along with the main stage talks on our PDF15 livestream and on Twitter with the hashtag #PDF15. If youre attending and still undecided as to which breakout sessions youll attend, check out this handy guide.


Christina Hawatmeh, the founder of Protestify, has created a visualization for the hashtag #PDF15. Keep an eye on it over the next two days! (ICYMI: I wrote about Protestify earlier this year.)


The Knight Foundation has released a report that seeks to explain why young voters (meaning millennials) might participate in national elections but not local elections. A lack of information and news coverage of local politics and candidates was found to be the biggest obstacle for participation. The report outlines a few things that could be done to increase voter turnout, including offering welcome packets to new city residents and engaging millennials more on digital platforms. One interesting tidbit from the report: millennials are especially tired of hearing that the system is broken.' Jon Sotsky, the Knight Foundation director for strategy and assessment, will be speaking on a PDF panel this afternoon at2pm on Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Participation.


This morning Rick Perry announced that he is running for president in 2016, Manny Fernandez reports for the New York Times.


Myfanwy Nixon writes for MySociety that the data from YourNextMP (whichWendy M. Grossman covered for techPresident earlier this year) was used in more than 20 projects, including ones by Google and the Guardian. In the weeks leading up to the election, Nixon reports the site had an average of 20,000 visitors a day, and on May 6, the day before the election, that shot up to 160,000 visitors.


The U.S. army is trying out bug drones, reports AJ Dellinger for the Daily Dot.


Out in San Francisco, Andy Greenberg made an untraceable semiautomatic rifle in his office, and he writes in Wired that it was easy: All I needed for my entirely legal DIY gunsmithing project was about six hours, a 12-year-olds understanding of computer software, an $80 chunk of aluminum, and a nearly featureless black 1-cubic-foot desktop milling machine called the Ghost Gunner.


Kevin Roose writes in Fusion that the sun might be about to set on all of the Uber for X companies that proliferated in 2014. His speculation inspiration: Carolyn Saids report in the San Francisco Chronicle last week that Homejoy, an Uber for house-cleaning, is struggling and might be for sale. Bonus: Do you remember which company in the late 1990s/early-aughts lost $1.50 to every dollar taken in?


Socratas Kevin Merritt has written an interesting thinkpiece in Quartz on govtech and the new(ish) revolving door from Silicon Valley to Washington, D.C. As we look towards the future, he concludes, its becoming increasingly clear that were currently witnessing a second American Revolution; but this time the government is being radically re-shaped by data-driven digital innovators who channel the thinking of Steve Jobs rather than patriotically-driven lawyers who accessed the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Hmm.


RIP, Politwoops: Twitter has revoked the Sunlight Foundations API access for their Politwoops site, reports J.K. Trotter for Gawker. A Twitter representative told Gawker that preserving deleted Tweets violates our developer agreement.


The New Media Ventures Innovation Fund is now accepting applications. Julie Menter, a manager at New Media Ventures, writes in an email to Civicist: Today, were excited to announce our next Open Call. We are seeking to make investments and grants in scalable media startups. Note that we define media broadly to include content creation, distribution, and promotion. Our Innovation Fund finances early-stage, for-profit and nonprofit startups with $50K, participation in NMVs startup support program and access to NMVs network of angel investors. Deadline is June 28, 2015.


This is civic tech: CivilHub, a platform for community organization, from the bottom-up. We havent had a chance to play around on it yet, but we sure are looking forward to it!


New hire: The former director of Open NY, Andrew Nicklin, has been hired by Johns Hopkins University to lead the open data team at the new (launched in April) Center for Government Excellence. Congrats!

The Electronic Frontier Foundations Cindy Cohn and Mark Jaycox explain why they are celebrating the Senates passage of the USA Freedom Act, even though EFF wanted it to go much further in strengthening privacy protections. They write, Passing a bill is far more difficult than simply killing a bad bill, and takes more sustained pressure from the public, a massive publicity campaign around a central issue, deep connections to lawmakers, and the coordination of diverse groups from across the political spectrum.The USA Freedom Act shows that the digital rights community has leveled up. Weve gone from just killing bad bills to passing bills that protect peoples rights.


Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, is passionate about privacy, as TechCrunchs Matthew Panzarino reports. Honored by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Cook said, Im speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information. Theyre gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think thats wrong. And its not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.


WikiLeaks is seeking to raise $100,000 as a bounty for the leaking of chapters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Amy Goodman of Democracy Now reports in an interview with Julian Assange.


Last we heard about Russias army of paid internet trolls, they were mainly focused on building support for Vladimir Putin and his intervention in Ukraine. Now, as Adrian Chen describes in a long feature in the Sunday New York Times Magazine, theres evidence that this force, centered on the so-called Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, may also be involved in various public safety hoaxes that have floated across American news pages in the last year.


Chen also notes that the pro-Kremlin troll army has contributed to a dawning sense, among the Russian journalists and activists I spoke with, that the internet is no longer a natural medium for political opposition....The internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them.


Hillary Clintons digital director Katie Dowd gets profiled by Nina Easton in Fortune Magazine, covering Dowds past work in the State Department on TechCamp, which trained civil society groups around the country in how to use social media and web tools for activism. (See also Eastons profile of Clinton campaign CTO Stephanie Hannon, which ran last week.)


Next week, MoveOn and Democracy for America will suspend their Run Warren Run effort to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to run for president, Ilya Sheyman and Charles Chamberlain, the groups heads, write in Politico. But they argue that they succeeded in embedding Warrens populist economic themes in the presidential contest and sent a message to other progressive Democrats, showing that grassroots progressives are ready to lift up candidates who refuse to kiss the rings of those corrupting our political system and rigging our economy.


A new New York Times/CBS poll shows deep support among Republicans and Democrats alike for new measures to restrict the influence of wealthy givers, including limiting the amount of money that can be spent by super PACs and forcing more public disclosure on organizations now permitted to intervene in elections without disclosing the names of their donors, report Nicholas Confessore and Megan Thee-Brenan. 39 percent of Americans say they want fundamental changes in the ways campaigns are funded, while 46 percent say they want the system completely rebuilt. A majority also say they dont consider money given to candidates to be a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment.


Comcast senior executive vice president David Cohen and his wife Rhonda are hosting a June 26 fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, the Wall Street Journals Peter Nicholas reports, and people are being encouraged to bundle $2,700 donations in order to be named co-hosts or event hosts.

On the front page of the New York Post, Michael Goodwin reports that unnamed NY Dems friendly to [former Mayor Mike] Bloomberg are trying to convince him to run as a Democrat for President.


Legislative data analytics start-up Quorum, which Im tempted to call the lobbyists best friend except that might end up in their marketing materials, is giving away free accounts to select Congressional interns this summer, Chris Bing reports for DCInno.


Ravi Somaiya of the New York Times reports on the kind of limbo that the Huffington Post has fallen into now that it has been bought by Verizon as part of the AOL deal, and its founder Arianna Huffington has not yet renewed her contract.

Bad news about the news business? Online millennials (born 1981-1996) and online baby boomers (born 1946-1964) are almost mirror opposites in terms of where they get their political news, the Pew Research Centers Amy Mitchell, Jeffrey Gottfried and Katerina Eva Matsa report. Of the former, 61 percent say Facebook is their main source of weekly political news, while 60 percent of the latter say local TV is.


As Facebook itself has released research showing that its News Feed algorithm contributes to political cloistering, this heavy reliance by millennials on Facebook for political news could be concerning, though Pews researchers are quick to point out their finding that it is the Facebook users in the oldest of the three generations studied here who are most likely to see political content on the site that supports their own views: 31% of Baby Boomers on Facebook who pay attention to political posts say the posts they see are mostly or always in line with their own views, higher than both Generation Xers (21%) and Millennials (18%).


Some fun facts buried deep in Pews report:


Among online news sources, the Huffington Post is both better known and more trusted by Millennials than Politico. 62 percent have heard of it and 20 percent trust it; just 20 percent have heard of Politico and only 7 percent trust it.


BuzzFeed is down in the trashbin side of the media ecosystem, more distrusted than trusted, along with the Sean Hannity Show, Breitbart, the Glenn Beck Program, and the Rush Limbaugh Show. (Its worth noting, re: the latter four, that Pew didnt survey the silent generation of pre-baby boomers for this report, since relatively few are online.)


Millennials trust the Daily Show for news a lot more than gen Xers or baby boomers.




Good news about the news business? It could be that Dutch people are crazy. Or, it could be that the innovative journalism aggregator Blendle has figured out how to make micropayments work. In this post on Medium, co-founder Alexander Klopping reports on the startups first year, growing to more than 250,000 users mostly under the age of 35, many of whom, he says, are paying for great journalism.


Among his findings: depending on online advertising is a losers game; metered payrolls that force readers to pay for bundled content from legacy sites might work for a huge newspaper (like the [New York] Times) in a huge market, but it wont for smaller papers in smaller markets; and in Blendles model, news doesnt sell, but background pieces, great analyses, opinion pieces and long interviews do.


My favorite part of Blendles model: users punish clickbait by refunding. That is, people only pay for the articles they read, but they can ask for their money back if they dont like the story. And something like 50 percent do so for gossip articles, while only around 5 percent do so overall on the site. (h/t Clay Shirky)

"Techaleidoscope" (opensource.com, CC BY-SA 2.0)

A version of this post was first published on Medium.
Civic tech has recently been the focus of exciting nonprofit federations, foundation-funded data visualizations, and the largest venture capital investment in government IT history. The problem is, no one seems to know exactly what it is  its like Potter Stewarts definition of pornography, we all just know it when we see it. No matter the definition, as Stacey Donohue recently wrote, civic tech is most certainly open for business. The question is, though, what kind of business is civic tech?
Ultimately, a business model is the DNA of a company, and the only meaningful promise that it makes to the public  and its funders are the only people that it has a legal duty to serve. Historically, that meant that businesses prioritized customers, but the advent of venture capital changes that  now, shareholders define value. Before we spend the projected $6.4 billion of public money on new technologies, we should consider whether traditional business models are the right choice for our digital civic commons.
Civic, as a term, has always been loosely defined  there are a lot of variations, but they all seem to hover around contributing to the administration of a city, town, or government. The word actually comes from 16th century Latin (corona civica) to describe the crown given to honor a citizen for saving another citizens life. Matt Stempeck does a better job of articulating the original intentions the word civic, than most . He describes it as prosocial, or the act of addressing shared challenges.
Technology is an equally wooly word  I originally thought of technology as electronics, and then as a euphemism for the natural evolution of systems. The word technology actually comes from Greek, and originally meant the systematic treatment of an art, craft, or technique. The word technology, it turns out, is as much about understanding the relationship between evolving systems and their effects, as it is about building new ones. In other words, its not just about the system, but the causes and effects of those systems. As Rodrigo Davies pointed out recently, there can be a big difference between what a company sets out to do and the effects (both good and bad) that it has on the world around it.
Taken together, then, civic technology isnt just about applying technology to solve shared problems, its also about understanding the relationship between the new systems we adopt and how we share the value they create.
Civic tech as a space, though, is predominantly defined by privately owned companies and nonprofits, meaning that when we spend public funds on them, were not only trying to understand shared value, were defining markets. The difference between private and publicly funded markets is that, theoretically, before a government spends public resources, it has to consider the effects of doing so. Not just on one problem or one group, but on the relationships and equality between groups.
Thats always been a big difference between the private sector and government  and, at times, a big source of tension. The private sector can do things that only tackle one part of a problem or only serve one type of person (usually, rich ones). Business doesnt have to consider the larger effects of its work, at least not until it endangers shareholder value. Not only can business start with a narrower scope, but businesses can fail  in technology, some people (controversially) encourage failure. When government fails, though, it is usually the most vulnerable who suffer. The freedom to test and fail enables the private sector to be our primary source of experimentation, innovation, and growth. But it is also an enormous reason to reconsider the design and implications of private systems before wholesale adopting them as gatekeepers to public services and servants.
Its fair to say that neither approach, taken to the extreme, is perfect  fully understanding the implications of a new system before its fully deployed is probably impossible. Conversely, deploying systems that solve the easiest version of a problem first, typically reach the privileged (with resources, social status, and/or coding skills) and leave more complicated versions to trickle down to the rest of the world. Trickle down system design isnt good for democracy or global markets. Influence over the design of a system  especially one that controls public resources  is power.
Leadership is essentially the privilege, power, or position to architect decisions and decision-making systems for others. Whats different between public and private leaders is who they have to consider when doing so, and, more importantly, whether theyre ultimately beholden to them. Public engagement, transparency, and accountability arent new ideas, but their translation into the technological design of public systems is still in its infancy. The U.S. government, with excellent leadership from champions in a number of offices (DigitalGov, White House OSTP, 18F & USDS among many others), are taking a wide range of approaches to opening data resources through APIs and broadening digital public participation. Similarly, a number of strong civil society champions are starting to tackle the component issues, from Laurenellen McCanns Build With campaign to Zeynep Turfekcis writing on the social impact of closed filtering algorithms to Kate Crawfords provocations of big data as a tool for governance. All of this is remarkable progress in a relatively short amount of time, but this kind of change will require more than public advocacy, it will require a different kind of business.
One of the unique aspects of media companies has always been the ability to sell the presumptive attention of its customers. The ability to sell a product, and then sell the attention of the users of that product, has always presented a challenge to integrity. In legacy media, that was the separation between editorial and advertising departments. In digital media, you can cut out the middle  namely, the independence of the product  and directly sell user attention to advertisers. That ability has fueled a massive industry, building some of the worlds largest companies, and  as Ethan Zuckerman points out  distorting the relationships, services, and content that communicate through digital tools. That distortion may seem trivial when it means the difference between an article and a listicle, but when it means voter manipulation or the presentation of evidence in court, its much harder to ignore.
Despite the exciting emergence of new models for civic engagement, the businesses themselves are largely built on traditional incorporation structures. As Keith Porcaro pointed out, even with the best intentions, traditional corporate structures have built-in limitations that make them imperfect trustees of any promise  let alone as gatekeepers between governments and the public. One of the largest limitations is the singular legal duty to maximize shareholder value.
Traditional incorporation structures legally require businesses to create, centralize, and maximize value for shareholders. That is a fundamentally different than, although sometimes overlaps with, maximizing value for users. Even newer social business structures like B Corps, only broaden what a company can consider in formulating fiduciary duty  they dont require, define, or compel any standard or duty of service to the companys customers.
In the long term, its possible for shareholder interests to align with those of users. However, theres a lot of market pressure to grow, which means going to investors for capital. Most investment is done through 10-year funds, meaning that companies have an average of 3-7 years to grow 10x in order to meet exit expectations. When thats the baseline, the priorities tend to be managing growth and maximizing revenue. Often, the quickest and easiest way to do that is selling advertising. Selling advertising isnt inherently bad, but it does create a set of often conflicting priorities between the business model and the integrity of the product. When that product or service is replaceable, thats fine. But once it becomes essential, when it becomes the only opportunity to reach an elected official or avoid jail, the costs of those conflicted priorities can be much higher.
Theres cause for optimism  the rise of patient and impact investing funds suggest that there may be room for different growth models in civic tech. The open data and open source movements are gradually reducing public dependence on individual technology companies (in both good and bad ways), and governments are starting to invest in building digital engagement capacity in a wide range of sectors. And, of course, there are vibrant and growing digital civic fellowship and volunteerism programs. Still, theres no question that big, traditional businesses will continue to play a huge role in the evolution of the way that we engage with public institutions and each other.
So. What, then, does a civic business look like?
A civic business should have a responsibility to the public, not only in outcome (i.e.  externalities), but in its fundamental processes. The core of any organization is how it prioritizes and applies its resources to meet the needs of its users. In civic technology, the users are both governments and citizens  and their needs are incredibly diverse. Despite a lot of discussion of user and human centered design, ultimately civic tech needs to find ways to serve all users, as equally as possible, as their needs evolve and change. That means that civic businesses should be more than open, they should develop models of direct and representative decision-making. As others note, more direct input into civic processes is important in both digital and analogue spaces.
As Doc Searls Project VRM does a great job of explaining, customer empowerment (and independence) requires more than a business model  it requires an ecosystem. But every ecosystem has to start somewhere, and in the civic space, that means rolling up our sleeves and working together to build a better business model. Civics are about working together to save our commons and each other  theres no reason that defining the intertwining relationships between government, people, and businesses should be any different.

The Senates failure to act yesterday means that some post-9/11 surveillance powers used, and some argue abused, by the U.S. government under the Patriot Act have at least temporarily expired, a victory for the strange bedfellow coalition of libertarian conservatives and liberals inspired by Edward Snowdens revelations two years ago. The Senate is now poised to pass the USA Freedom Act, which has already passed the House, refusing to simply renew the Patriot Acts mass surveillance provisions as had been desired by surveillance hawks like Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Commenting on Snowdens impact, Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) told The Guardian, I think it played the same role for me as it did for most of the American people, who were surprised and stunned that the government had this sort of access to this kind of data.

Its about heightened exposure to the most egregious examples of political malpractice.

First Post 



Personal Democracy Forum is next week, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. What follows are a few words from Harold Feld, Senior Vice President of Public Knowledge. Feld will be speaking on the net as a public utility.

So, for people who arent familiar with your work, how does it relate to civic tech?
I focus on the intersection of law and policy in telecommunications and tech at the U.S. federal level. We work to ensure the availability of ubiquitous, affordable, and meaningful broadband access. By meaningful, I mean without either government or corporate intermediaries able to prohibit or unduly influence how others use broadband and other new technologies.
For example, we have been very involved in the net neutrality debate and pushed for reclassification of broadband as a Title II telecommunications service as early as January 2010. We are active in the effort to limit patent trolls and work to reform copyright law so that it cannot be used to strangle free speech.
Youll be speaking at the conference on the subject of the net as a public utility. What still needs to be addressed in the wake of the net neutrality win? What isnt getting enough attention?
We need to recognize the importance of what we have won, and how easily we can still lose it. To say that something is a public utility in the United States does not have anything to do with whether it is a monopoly or a regulated rate. For the last 125 years we have used the term public utility to describe a service so fundamental to our participation in society and our economic well being that we cannot leave them to the benevolence of corporations, the indifference of the market, or the kindness of kings. We must safeguard the right of all people to access under a rule of law. We do this with electricity, with transportation, with water, and with a very small number of other critical services.
The fundamental right to communicate is one of these services. We have that principle embedded in our Constitution, and it has been the cornerstone of telephone regulation for more than 100 years. As a result, 96 percent of the country have access to some kind of voice telephony service. We need to recognize that broadband falls in this same category: a service so essential that government has a responsibility to ensure that all people have affordable access.
Put another way, it is common to think that we care about classifying broadband as a Title II telecommunications service because that was the only way to ensure net neutrality. But it is really the other way around. We care about net neutrality so passionately because we recognize broadband has become essential in our lives. With that realization, we now have a responsibility to ensure that everyone has legally protected rights to enjoy the benefits of this fundamental service.
The theme of the conference this year is the future of civic tech. As briefly as you like: Where do you think civic tech is going, what do we have to look forward to, and what pitfalls should people working in this sector be aware of?
I think the future of civic tech lies in moving from scarcity to abundance. Corporate profit depends on scarcity, but to unlock the civic potential of technology requires ubiquity. I think our greatest pitfall is trying to measure success with the wrong numbers. Its not about creating the next hot startup. Its not about generating videos with millions of hits. Hundreds of thousandseven millionsof people able to talk in their own voices to each other is more critically important then the creation of a new entertainment colossus. When we see how people use these technologies to organize for social change, to learn new things, to open new worlds, and to express themselves freely to the world in their own voices, then we have truly accomplished something more important than the next Google or next Netflix.

Solomon Kahn at a Civic Hall brown bag lunch. (Civic Hall)
In the hours hes not working at Paperless Post or spending time with his wife and baby, Solomon Kahn is a crusader for campaign finance transparency. Earlier today, Kahn stopped by Civic Hall for a brown bag lunch to share the a visualization tool he built using OpenSecrets data that lets users dive into politicians campaign finance records, all the way down to individual-level donors, if necessary. Kahn is currently raising money on Kickstarter to help pay for hosting and to support outreach and training for journalists who can best make use of the tool.
Using his own local congressperson, Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY), as an example, Kahn demonstrated  how the visualization made it easy to see that Crowley went from getting 27 percent of his campaign funds from labor groups and 14 percent from finance/insurance/real estate in 2000, to getting 6 percent of funds from labor and 38 percent from finance/insurance/real estate in 2014. Digging a bit deeper, Kahn found that one of Crowleys largest contributors is the Blackstone Group, and that in 2007, 14 people affiliated with Blackstone, who had never contributed to Crowley before, all gave $2,300 on the exact same day.
Kahn says that users will be able to submit scoops like this which, once vetted for accuracy, will be displayed at the top of a politicians page so that journalists and other interested folks will see notable facts like the above right off the bat. (An audience member asks if hes thought about annotation, to which Kahn replies: Thats complicated, and reiterates the limits of his time and money.)
Helping journalists make the most of the tool is one of Kahns priorities. For a reporter in Sunnyside [Queens, New York] at the Tribune to get a story like this would just be impossible without this kind of tool, Kahn tells those gathered at Civic Hall.
There are thousands of potential front page of reddit stories hidden in 25 years of campaign finance data, Kahn writes to potential Kickstarter backers. He wants to make sure those stories see the light of day.
Speaking of reddit, Kahn says hell be promoting the tool in a reddit I Am A, Ask Me Anything session soon, so keep your eyes peeled for that.

#PDF15 is one week away! Weve posted the Personal Democracy Forum 2015 guide to the 27 breakout sessions taking place during next weeks conference. And Im happy to report that the overall gender breakdown of our 131 confirmed speakers is 66 men, 64 women and one transgender person. (Who says you cant #changetheratio? This is our fourth year in a row with gender parity among speakers.)


Food for thought (1): Innovation That Matters, a new 154-page report on civic innovation focused on eight major U.S. cities finds that cities with the most developed civic tech ecosystems are cities where civic entrepreneurs feel confident in their ability to reach out to mentors, investors, anchor institutions such as universities and larger businesses, and gatekeepers within municipal government and receive some type of response, Andrew Zaleski reports for Next City. Building better integration between the network of actors within a given community is the most important factor in increasing civic entrepreneurship, says the report, which is a joint venture of the 1776 incubator in Washington D.C. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.


San Francisco, which the reports authors note obviously has a very strong tech community, is still working to bridge the gap between tech and civic institutions. [T]he traditional tech entrepreneurship model pioneered in Silicon Valley has not yet discovered a method to fully collaborate with existing institutional resources, Zaleski notes, citing the reports authors. New York, he says, an established civic tech ecosystem, proves to be the model on this front.


Food for thought (2): Here are a few highlights from Mary Meekers annual Internet Trends report, released yesterday:


While the consumer sector of the U.S. economy has been totally impacted by the internet, Meeker says the three least-impacted sectors, by comparison, are education, healthcare and government/regulation/policy thinking.


87 percent of American millennials say my smartphone never leaves my side, night or day and 60 percent believe in the next five years, I believe everything will be done on mobile devices.


34 percent of millennials prefer to collaborate online at work as opposed to in-person or by phone, nearly double the level for older generations.


In Shanghai, Tencent WeChat users can get the following government services through their mobile app: hospital appointments, payments for electricity/water/gas bills, obtain travel documents, smog test appointments, property tax lookups, driving violation lookups, and weather/library search.




Food for thought (3): With Voxs purchase of Re/Code as the latest piece of unspoken context, John Herrman of The Awl takes a hard look at the state of online media and the race for traffic, and comes to two critical conclusions you may want to ponder long and hard: First, In most cases...a publisher reliant on platformsreluctantly or enthusiasticallyis required to give up a substantial part of its identity. It borrows its audience. It takes editorial cues from the company from which the audience is borrowed. It rents space not just with promises of unusually high-quality content, but, in some cases, with the splitting of revenue. This is a situation in which success is aligned with sublimation.


And second, the next year is going see a fairly large shaking-out: an elimination of redundancy by platforms that incidentally encouraged it; a choosing of partners and therefore winners and losers; a fundamental change in the terms that publishers thought they had with the platforms theyve come to depend on, even though the platforms never actually promised anything. Some of the most successful websites may prove to be the most vulnerable. The speed and nimbleness with which they were able to appear, grow, and surpass their print-centric predecessors publishing businesses on the internet was dazzling; so too will be the speed with which they can disappear.


The Workers Lab 2015 Summer Institute, which is designed for entrepreneurs & organizers seeking feedback on their business ideas, ventures, and/or platforms focused on empowering and building justice for U.S. workers, is taking applications for fellows.

Personal Democracy Forum is next week, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. What follows are a few words from Cathy ONeil, who writes at the blog mathbabe.org and is working on a book about the dark side of big data. ONeil will deliver a talk on Weapons of Math Destruction.
Youll be speaking at the conference on the subject of weapons of math destruction. Give us a preview: what the heck are weapons of math destruction?!
They are mathematical algorithms that are being deployed to make important life decisions for certain people at certain moments. They are characterized by their opacity, their power, their widespread use, their poor definitions of success, and their engendering of pernicious feedback loops. I will give a bunch of examples of WMDs from education (the Value-Added Model for Teachers), the criminal justice system (evidence-based sentencing models), and politics (micro-targeting).
The theme of the conference this year is the future of civic tech. As briefly as you like: Where do you think civic tech is going, what do we have to look forward to, and what pitfalls should people working in this sector be aware of?
Id say that my example with micro-targeting in politics is more or less an intersection of WMDs with civic tech. I am, in other words, a civic tech skeptic.
Im focusing on the pitfalls. Civic tech has a lot of positive vibes but successful data work, which is usually done in the quest of power, money, or both, should teach us a few lessons. If we want data or technology to work for the public good, we have to make it so in a deliberate and thoughtful fashion. Its not good enough for us to open up the data and wait for the tide that lifts all boats.

Taking questions during a break-out session at #PDF13. (Personal Democracy Media)

You want panels? We got panels. Herewith, the Personal Democracy Forum 2015 guide to the 27 breakout sessions planned for the two days of the conference, this coming June 4-5. Theyre organized in seven thematic tracks: Organizing and Activism, Digital Tools and Techniques, Civic Clinics, Ideas and Controversies, Media Praxis, Tech Futures, and We-Government. Most of them are structured with three or four expert speakers, with time for short presentations, panel discussion and audience participation. A few are participatory workshops (as noted). This is where you get to drill deep on topics you care about, brush up on the latest developments in your field, and find other people with interests like yours.
As in past years, all panels are taking place after lunch, in two hour-long slots from 2:00-3:00pm and 3:30-4:30pm, with a coffee break in between. All of them are in NYUs Kimmel Center, accessible by elevator from Skirball Center where the main hall talks take place.
Organizing and Activism
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Confronting the Counterrevolution: How Civic Actors Can Hold Their Own in Global Affairs. Amb. Ben Rowswell, Katherine Maher, Andrea Chalupa, and Taylor Owen (moderator). In global politics, networks of individuals are challenging existing power structures. With minimal organizational structure, these groups leverage anonymity and encryption, and are capable of the type of collective action once reserved for large hierarchical organizations. But from Russia to Venezuelato the United States for that matterthe state is fighting back. As they grow in power, citizen movements attract more adversaries jealous of defending their own power. In the Hobbesian world of global politics, disruption has the potential to become a brutal process. This panel will look at how how digitally-enabled civic action groups can structure themselves to compete in the global political arena.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: How the Net (Neutrality Battle) Was Won. Michael Khoo, Althea Erickson, Evan Greer, Malkia Cyril, and Sally Kohn (moderator). This panel will focus on two key topics: How grass-roots techies, civil rights activists, and industry start-ups combined forces to win the fight for public opinion and the open internet, and what challenges lie ahead in sustaining that victory.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Pro-Internet and I Vote: How Can the Net Build Political Power in 2016? Malkia Cyril, David Segal, Zephyr Teachout, Jessy Tolkan, and Craig Aaron (moderator). Overseas, some internet activists are forming political parties, like the Pirate Party, and in some places winning a share of representation. But politics in America is structured (and some might say constrained) by the two-party system. Building on the net neutrality session above, and with the 2016 election approaching, this panel will discuss how pro-internet activism and populist energy can be translated into real and lasting political power.
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: Black Twitter, #BlackLivesMatter: Turning Pain Into Political Power. Lizz Brown, Lauren Brown, Bridget Todd, Kimberly Ellis (moderator). In a follow-up to her PDF 2014 main hall speech last year, Dr. Kimberly C. Ellis (aka @DrGoddess) will host a panel discussion on the role of #BlackTwitter in the movement-with-a-hashtag activism of #BlackLivesMatter. This panel will also explore the further application of tech innovation to civic engagement, examining how to turn the pain of poverty, police brutality, and other forms of injustice into actual political power beyond street protests.
Digital Tools and Techniques
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Navigating the Political Data Provider Landscape. Tom Dougherty, Jim Gilliam, Tiana Epps-Johnson, Paul Westcott, and Heidi Sieck (moderator). If you want to influence politics, you need to know what buttons to push. In a digital world that means knowing where voter, candidate and election data is and how to get it. The panel of leading data providers and practitioners will get you the answers.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: How Digital Advertising is Reshaping Everything. Annie Levene, Josh Koster, Patrick Ruffini, and Tracy Russo (moderator). Just how far can, and should, you go in microtargeting your message? What techniques are proving most effective, cost-wise? This panel will look at emerging campaign strategies as we head into 2016, and focus on how the make the most of your digital advertising dollar.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Innovations in Messaging the Electorate (Sponsored by Rentrak). Scott Tanter, Christopher Frommann, Jennifer Green, Bret Leece, Edward Niles, and Carol Davidsen (moderator). This panel will build on Davidsens main hall keynote at the end of Thursday, and take a closer look at the origination of integrated data sets, how campaigns use them, and how privacy is handled. 
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: Using Facebook for Advocacy (Sponsored by Facebook). Steve Jacobs, Deanna Zandt, Alex Torpey, and Crystal Patterson (moderator). The worlds biggest social network has become a critical vehicle for all kinds of advocacy. This panel will zero in on how it can best be used by people in and around government to improve civic engagement and public responsiveness.
Civic Clinics
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Participation. John Webb, Jon Sotsky, Sandy Heierbacher, and Allison Fine (moderator). While many Americans engage in civic life, doing everything from voting, joining causes, volunteering in their communities and voicing their concerns, tens of millions are on the sidelines. Some are locked out. And some are tuning out to processes that dont engage them. This panel will explore new research on why so many Americans are civic bystanders, why they dont vote in local elections, and whether different approaches to civic engagement may be more fruitful.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: Labs for Social and Economic Development. Palak Shah, Carmen Rojas, Hannah Calhoon, and Ibrahim Abdul Matin (moderator). In the last few years, tech innovators and movements for economic justice have started collaborating on new models for serving the needs of Americas poorest and most exploited workers. In this session, the founders of three such labs will share what theyve learned so far.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Build With, Not For (Workshop I). Co-led by Josh Stearns, Kenneth Bailey, Liz Barry, An Xiao Mina, Sandy Heierbacher, and Demond Drummer. We can build better civic tech, journalism, campaigns, global development projects, and more if we reorient our processes to work with communities, not for them. This two-part workshop will focus on drawing lessons from across sectors and highlighting tools to help anyone build with, not for. (Attendees can reap maximum value even if theyre only able to make one of the two sessions.) The first session is focused on cross-sector storytelling. As a group, attendees will discuss what inclusive development looks like across sectors and the challenges faced in initiating these processes in the context of our respective professional fields. The conversation will be guided by co-leads working on collaborative development in a variety of fields who will share their experience addressing and overcoming these issues. By the end, participants will have built a common language of challenge, spec-ed out some starter points for solutions/actions, identified potential collaborations beyond PDF, and hold a more intersectional perspective on what bottom-up innovation means.
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: Build With, Not For (Workshop II). Josh Stearns, Kenneth Bailey, Liz Barry, An Xiao Mina, Sandy Heierbacher, and Demond Drummer. In this second session, participants will go through a design exercise for moving at the speed of inclusion. Attendees will break into small groups, each facilitated by one of the co-leads above, and go through the process of developing an engagement plan for a civic project. In addition to putting lessons from the first session into action, participants will also learn foundational skills for putting these lessons into action, such as how to map stakeholders and intervention (also known as engagement) opportunities. This session will have an element of play to it. At the end, participants reflect on their process together and collect the plans to be published online where anyone can fork them (social code working just like computer code, after all).
Ideas and Controversies
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Hacking Culture for Social Change. Andrew Slack, Bridgit Antoinette Evans, Kerri Kelly, and Tracy Van Slyke (moderator). If you change culture, you change politics. This panel will explore how a new generation of digitally savvy activism is working with major cultural tropes and happenings to try to alter Americas course.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Cooperative Alternatives to the Sharing Economy. Trebor Scholz, Palak Shah, Andres Monroy-Hernandez, and Nancy Scola (moderator). Continuing a conversation begun in mid-March with a panel at Civic Hall, this session will delve into efforts to organize industries and write code that empowers workers and participants more than owners and investors. 
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: Connecting the Unconnected: Access, Digital Inclusion and the Open Web (Sponsored by Mozilla). Raina Kumra, Josh Levy, Jochai Ben Avie and Nancy Scola (moderator). Owning a mobile phone is not necessarily joining the internet. There are a quarter billion Android users who have never connected to the internet, and in some markets users spend 10 percent of their wages on data. Companies, governments, civil society, and other actors are wrestling with how to bring the next wave of users to the internet, with some pioneering new business models and approaches, notably zero-rating. This breakout session will begin with brief positioning statements examining the benefits and harms of zero-rating, and will explore alternative market solutions to connecting users to the full diversity of the open Web. Then participants will be invited into an interactive discussion around models that are already being tested and how to form an agenda that enables digital inclusion.
Media Praxis
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Fixing Our Attention. Tristan Harris, Rachel Weidinger, Andrew Golis, and Sabrina Hersi Issa (moderator). The future is here and its breaking the present, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff has written. As a result, our personal and collective ability to focus on stuff that matters is constantly being challenged by media and technology that tries to distract us with spectacle and addict us using behavioral science. Building on Harris morning keynote on this topic, this panel will discuss strategies for reversing these trends, ranging from a new ethics of tech design to apps and organizing strategies that may help us pay attention to what is truly important.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: Check It Before You Wreck It: Fighting Viral Misinformation Online. Claire Wardle, Madeline Bair, Ellery Biddle, Sunita Bose, and Tom Trewinnard (moderator). Social networks have proven to be powerful platforms for spreading information during critical, breaking events. However, increasingly this takes the form of rumor, fake content and misinformation: think Hurricane Sandy, Syria and the Boston Marathon Bombings. This panel will discuss the misinformation ecosystem, introduce recent efforts to build a culture of verification, and offer tangible debunking methods for journalists, citizen journalists, and anyone who gets their news via social media.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: How Civic Tech is Changing the Way Newsrooms Cover Elections. Jenn Topper, Derek Willis, Jonathan Capehart, Luciana Lopez, and Chris Gates (moderator). This panel will unpack how civic tech is changing the way newsrooms cover elections. In the year preceding the 2016 presidential campaign, newsrooms are already staffing up for the election. Meanwhile, technology offers newer, more impactful ways of storytelling. Well discuss how the landscape has changed since the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, what technology might be on the horizon in 2016, and how it might affect the concept and expectation of real-time reporting.
Tech Futures
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Disruptive Opportunities in Mobile. Bart Myers, Ted Henderson, Damola Ogundipe, Rachna Choudhry, and Erhardt Graeff (moderator). As users spend more time on their mobile devices and less at PCs, civic tech is shifting too. This panel will look at new and existing efforts to better connect people to their representatives and to bring civic information to people when they may be most inclined to engage with it.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: Building Businesses in Civic Tech (Sponsored by Omidyar Network). Jim Gilliam, Story Bellows, Dan Brillman, and Stacy Donohue (moderator). Building on ONs conference on the business of civic tech at Civic Hall in April, this panel will explore paths to creating sustainable and successful civic-tech businesses. 
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Financing Political and Civic Tech. Shaun Abrahamson, Stacy Donohue, Benoit Wirz, Mike Mathieu, and Julie Menter (moderator). Its tough to get funding for a new venture, even more so if its trying to create positive change. This panel of funders will take participants behind the curtain and share the best ways to raise capital, how investors evaluate entrepreneurs, and what a great pitch looks like. It will cover solutions for both for-profit and non-profit structures, as well as the hybrids in between.
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: The Evolution of Political Analytics. Scott Tranter, Kass Devorsey, Masahiko Aida, David Seawright, and Ethan Roeder (moderator). Campaign analytics is no longer an experiment. Now its a guiding light for campaigns, a standard by which the modernity of a campaign is measured and a field of practice that has attracted tens of millions of dollars of investment since 2012. This panel will look at questions including: What strategic advantage can campaigns still hope to yield from analytics? How are the newly established for-profit institutions in the space influencing the practice? In 2015, with enhanced national voter files a ubiquitous resource, the building of individual-level candidate support and turnout models has been described as a trivial task. If microtargeting is no longer a strategic advantage, what is? What benefits will campaigns reap from the established institutions on both the left and the right? How might these outside actors complicate or even impede the efforts of campaigns? Much has been made of the culture gap between Democratic and Republican campaigns in terms of how they use tech and collaborate over data, but is the gap really that big? 
We-Government
Thursday June 42:00-3:00pm: Speedbumps on the Road to Govt as a Platform (Sponsored by Accela). Emma Mulqueeny, Amen Ra Mashariki, Greg Bloom, and Mark Headd (moderator). Big cities, states, and national governments in the U.S. and U.K. have embraced open data. Events like NYC Big Apps and the National Day of Civic Hacking in the U.S., Hack the Government in the U.K., and GovHack in Australia are encouraging civic hackers to build new apps and services with government data. A growing number of commercial entities, big and small, new and old, are looking at open data as a way to build a business, or enhance an existing one. Several years into the open data revolution, how are we doing? This panel will discuss the current state of open data, government as a platform and have a frank and open discussion on where were falling short and how we can do better.
Thursday June 43:30-4:30pm: NYC 2025: A Workshop with the Mayors Office Digital Team. Jeff Merritt, Minerva Tantoco, and Jessica Singleton. Come brainstorm about the future beyond todays effort to close the digital divide. Believe it or not, 2025 is just ten years away! At this workshop-style session, you can share your ideas and visions with City Halls digital doers.
Friday June 52:00-3:00pm: Reinventing the Think Tank (sponsored by New America). Tim Wu, Annmarie Levins, Alec Ross, and Anne Marie Slaughter (moderator). This panel will look at how to marry policy, technology, bottom-up change, and how to connect government to citizens in the business of solving public problems in this century.
Friday June 53:30-4:30pm: Designing the Digital Legislature. Emma Mulqueeny, Ben Kallos, Seamus Kraft, David Moore, and Melissa Sandgren (moderator). As representative bodies from the U.K. Parliament and U.S. Congress down to city councils start to modernize their use of technology, innovators on the inside and outside alike are working to think beyond simply delivering our grandparents government at the click of a mouse. New forms of interaction enabled by open, collaborative tools are on the horizon. This panel will hear from several key innovators helping point the way towards a genuinely digital legislature.

In the interest of greater transparency, the Clinton Foundation has posted a list of paid speeches its principals (Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton) have made that have helped support its work. The details are tantalizingly limited: for example, of three speeches listed by President Clinton that earned between half a million and a million dollars (per speech!), one is attributed to something called Hanwha. (Thats one of South Koreas largest business conglomerates.)


Under Clintons leadership, the State Department approved $165 billion worth of commercial arms sales to 20 nations whose governments have given money to the Clinton Foundation, report David Sirota and Andrew Perez for the International Business Times, analyzing State Department and Clinton Foundation data. They add: In all, governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by Clintons State Department have delivered between $54 million and $141 million to the Clinton Foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the Clinton family, according to foundation and State Department records. The Clinton Foundation publishes only a rough range of individual contributors donations, making a more precise accounting impossible.


The State Department is proposing to release batches of Clintons private emails every two months, starting in June, Josh Gerstein reports for Politico.


Remember how the Obama campaign experimented with all kinds of email formats? Hillary Clintons presidential campaign has now launched The Feed (subtitled: Read It, Watch It, Share It) which gets delivered to your inbox like any other campaign email, but looks and feels like a graphically punched-up e-newsletter stocked with the campaigns latest social sharing ploys. You can only get it by joining the campaign.


Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) held a campaign rally in his home city of Burlington, where locals long loyal to his independent and socialist politics mingled with former Occupy Wall Street organizers like Charles Lenchner and Winnie Wong, who are assisting his campaign, reports Jonathan Topaz for Politico.


Going to one source of the dark-money maelstrom hitting American politics, the Center for Public Integritys Carrie Levine zeroes in on David Langdon, a suburban Cincinnati lawyer whose firm is one point of convergence for nearly a dozen conservative groups spending money to influence elections. He refused an interview, and when Levine knocked on the door of his home, he said Youre not welcome here, calling approaching him at his home unbelievably unprofessional. More of this, please.


The Internal Revenue Service admitted yesterday that attackers obtained the tax information of 100,000 filers, using previously stolen information to crack the get transcript feature on the IRS website, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired.


Why did the first FCC chairman under President Obama, Julius Genachowski, waver in his declared support for the open internet despite being a tech entrepreneur with a personal relationship with the president, while the second chairman, Tom Wheeler, a former telco industry lobbyist, delivered as a forceful champion of net neutrality? In Mediums BackChannel, Susan Crawford offers her theory of the case.


Bart Myers, the CEO of Countable, writes a smart op-ed in The Hill about the future of political and civic tech: There will be limited growth for those who believe that techs future in policy and advocacy is just creating mini echo chambers, where people with an issue in common join ranks among themselves for politicians to target them....On the other hand, the political apps and websites that will find success are the ones that will place less emphasis on divisions. They will drive constant reengagement by introducing people to a wider array of issues and causes that audiences might not have been aware of, but care about.

Personal Democracy Forum is in less than two weeks, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. What follows are a few words from Nanjira Sambuli, a research manager at iHub in Nairobi, who will deliver a talk on During and After Atrocity: How Kenyans Use The Web to Heal and Deal.
So, for people who arent familiar with your work, how does it relate to civic tech?
I manage research around governance and technology at iHub. That basically means that I spearhead and/or oversee research projects that assess how technology is being adopted or co-opted into governance in Kenya, and increasingly in East Africa. Its relation to civic tech is through insights gleaned from, for instance, studying if/how ICTs have facilitated two-way interaction between government and citizens. 
Youll be talking at the conference about how Kenyans have used the web to heal and deal. What most surprises you about the use of the web after an atrocity?
My country has faced a number of security-related tragedies in the past three years, and due to the increasing uptake of social media, Kenyans have had an opportunity to grieve together, share in their anger, and at various turns engage in collective action towards seeking accountability or raising funds for emergency relief. It has been particularly interesting to observe the various civic roles that Kenyans online have engaged in, individually and collectively. It has also been interesting to observe the life cycle. For instance, very pertinent, difficult questions are often asked, in a quest to seek accountability. Folks, for instance, will tweet various authorities and representatives with great vigor in the heat of an event, but that vigor seems to dissipate the moment we move on to something else in the news cycle. Observing this over time has led me to wonder if the use of social media in times like these, and how Kenyans typically engage on these platforms, can be considered civic tech, and what that means for developers, legislators, civil society organisers, activists and others keen on engaging them online, or offline towards a civic action. The Kenyan case is not necessarily unique, but a particularly interesting one off which to ask deeper questions on what constitutes civic tech: is it tools, is it the use of tools, is it both?
The theme of the conference this year is the future of civic tech. As briefly as you like: Where do you think civic tech is going, what do we have to look forward to, and what pitfalls should people working in this sector be aware of?
Im intrigued by the idea behind the term and concept of civic technology. As yet, I havent come across an agreed upon definition, and based on practice, it seems centered around designing specific tools that can facilitate or enhance civic engagement or civic action. I am curious as to how impact is assessed. I am curious (as a researcher) whether citizens needs are incorporated into design and implementation. I am curious as to what has been found to be the motivation and incentives among the various target audiences to use and reuse such tools as designed. One pitfall I think should be considered is that people may not be keen to visit 10 different apps designed for 10 different civic actions...how do we ensure that the design, deployment and continued use of civic technology is considered meaningful and worthwhile in the long-term?

Personal Democracy Forum is in less than two weeks, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. What follows are a few words from Catherine Bracy, Code for Americas Director of Community Organizing, who will deliver a talk entitled Public Engagement Is Broken. Are You Part of the Problem?
So, for people who arent familiar with your work, how does it relate to civic tech?
Code for Americas mission is to build government that works for the people, by the people in the 21st century. We do that by collaborating with government on improving service deliveryin the health, safety and justice, and economic development areasthrough technology. We also focus on improving the publics relationship with government by creating innovative spaces and channels (sometimes digital) where government and residents can meet.
I understand youll be speaking at the conference about how public engagement is broken. Is this public engagement with government or with communities or something else entirely? You will also address how someone can tell if they are part of the problem; are people in the audience going to be squirming when you get there?
Im speaking specifically about the publics engagement with government. Im certainly hoping to challenge the audience to think critically about our role as advocates for digital democracy. Are we focused on the right problems? Where are our blind spots? Why havent we been able to significantly move the needle on the publics sense of trust in government? But, Im also really hopeful and plan to share some bright spots Im seeing.
The theme of the conference this year is the future of civic tech. As briefly as you like: Where do you think civic tech is going, what do we have to look forward to, and what pitfalls should people working in this sector be aware of?
I think were at a point in the civic (gov) tech movement where we can move from building apps to show whats possible to really thinking strategically about how we can implement technology to make structural change inside government. We are beginning to measure our success not just by how many users a particular app gets, but by how much impact a tool has on a social outcome, or by the kinds of process and policy changes that happen within institutions as a result of building a tool. In terms of what to watch out for, I think were going to need to pay a lot of attention to privacy as we help governments open more data. But generally, there are lots of pitfalls whenever you try to change the status quo. As someone, cant remember who, said, the first ones through the wall are always the bloodiest. But the friction is part of the process. Its how we know were getting stuff done. And were extremely excited about whats next.

With the Patriot Act reauthorization vote stymied in the Senate, security analyst Bruce Schneier points to critical commentary by the ACLUs chief technologist Chris Soghoian noting that the failure to extend Section 215 of the act will not end other forms of bulk surveillance, including bulk orders to calling card companies, Skype and BOIP companies.


Related: Philip Zimmerman, the inventor of the email encryption system Pretty Good Privacy, explains to Juliette Garside of the Guardian why he has moved his company Silent Circle to Switzerland: Every dystopian society has excessive surveillance, but now we see even western democracies like the U.S. and England moving that way, he warns. We have to roll this back. People who are not suspected of committing crimes should not have information collected and stored in a database. We dont want to become like North Korea. (Must interesting nugget from this story: Among Silent Circles backers is one Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 U.S. presidential candidate.)


Bonus quote from Zimmerman: A certain amount of elbow grease has to be expended when the police do their work. If it becomes too frictionless, you can slide more easily into a police state. I think we should restore a little bit of that friction.

Personal Democracy Forum is in less than three weeks, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. What follows are a few words from Nancy Lublin, the CEO of DoSomething.org and Crisis Text Line.
Nancy Lublin at PDF 2013
Your upcoming talk is titled Winner Texts All. In your work at Crisis Text Line, youve made intensely personal connections possible over a seemingly impersonal communication method. What has that taught you about capturing the power of the text message? Where is the inspiration for your talk coming from?
Text feels both more private and anonymous, while also allowing for deeply personal real sharing. Its a phenomenal medium for counseling. Last week someone posted something on Imgur that said: I suffer from depression and my anxiety prevents me from calling the suicide hotline. Found out there is a text version 741-741 Start and its been some of the best advice no therapist in 16 years has given me. That post was shared over 600,000 times in 24 hours, then went to Tumblr, then the homepage of Reddit.
The theme of the conference this year is the future of civic tech. As briefly as you like: Where do you think civic tech is going, what do we have to look forward to, and what pitfalls should people working in this sector be aware of?
Im excited about how much is happening in this space, but I am going to lay down a controversial plea: we dont need lots of stuff, we need lots of good stuff. For example, Crisis Text Line copycats are a really dumb idea that will confuse people and fragment the data. So while I believe in an open system, Im hoping we can all be smart and collaborate to do the best, most important work, efficiently.

Eighty-eight percent of Americans do not want to be watched without their permission, Mary Madden and Lee Rainie report, citing data from two new surveys of public opinion done by the Pew Research Center. They also have little confidence that government agencies, landline telcos, or credit card companies will keep their records private and secure.


Playing off the fact that many Americans claim not to be bothered by the NSA listening in on their communications, WeAreAlwaysListening.com, an anti-NSA spoof, has posted online the recorded audio of conversations it surreptitiously collected of real New Yorkers as they go about their day, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired.


The first GOP presidential debate, which will take place August 6 in Cleveland, will be presented by Fox News in partnership with Facebook, the two companies announced yesterday. According to a joint release, the debate will feature Facebook data illustrating how the issues of the day are resonating with people on todays largest platform for political conversation. FOX News viewers and Facebook users will also be able to share images and video questions via Facebook, some of which will be used to help formulate questions for the candidates and broadcast during the debate. According to Andy Mitchell, Facebooks news and partnerships director, Foxs use of Facebook demonstrates how the platform has become an essential part of the political process.


Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is now on LinkedIn. And she has just 489 followers (something you can collect there as a verified influencer). Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is also there, but he has just 128 connections and no followers. Not an influencer? Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has 500+ connections, befitting his Ivy League education.

In the New Republic, Nathan Schneider (Civic Hall member) writes in praise of what he calls the Slow Computing movement, likening his use of free and open software like Ubuntu and Emacs and a locally-based service called ownCloud, to the Slow Food movement. To wit:

There is a habit in tech culture of saying that the latest app is democratizing whatever it happens to do. This is lovely, but best not to confuse it with actual democracy. Democracy is about participation with control, freedom with accountability, privacy with transparency. Tech companies tend to pick and choose from that list rather inventively. Were expected to participate in their networks without having control over how they work. Were transparent about every detail of our lives with them, while theyre private about what they do with it. Free-and-open software, however, operates on a different time-scale. Since nobody owns it, its harder to become fabulously wealthy from it. People make these programs because they need them, not because they think they can manipulate someone to want them. Its slower. Instead of relying on rich kids in a Googleplex somewhere, Slow Computing works best when were employing people nearby...

First Post 



We want to make mafia visible to everyone, city by city, region by region.
I am not at a press conference held by the Italian Ministry of Internal Affairs or the Head of the police; Im with a group of young political science students. And this is not just wishful thinking: MafiaMaps is an app they are building to map the mafia phenomenon all over Italy.
Pierpaolo Farina, Hermes Mariani, Claudio Ripamonti, and Samuele Motta are part of the core group of MafiaMaps volunteers, about 15 people in their early- to mid-20s. We meet in the courtyard of the Political Science faculty of the University of Milan, where theyre studying or recently graduated.
The group met and bonded during a political science class on the sociology of organized crime.
While in Italy there ispredictablya lot of research on the mafia, the young students felt that there wasnt a structured organization of all that knowledge.
So, two years and a half ago, they started WikiMafia, an online encyclopedia (Creative Commons-licensed) that now counts more than 200 full articles, and another 1,000 partially completed or draft articles.
On WikiMafia, you can find anything from mafia organizations and their historical development to power structures and infiltration in the public administration and private sector.
But as the WikiMafia volunteers work and their academic careers progressed, they felt that something was missing: How do you give people immediate access to all this knowledge? How do you make people understand that mafia is everywhere in Italy and closer than people think?  
They eventually figured out that an app would make all of their research immediately available to anyone.
That idea became MafiaMaps, a constantly updated map pinpointing the last-known location of convicted criminals and of mafia killings, as well as where anti-mafia organizations are at work, creating projects and organizing events.
MafiaMaps showing the area around Milan. The images make it easier to identify specific incidents such as arrests or killings.
Building a knowledge baseand a crowdfunding campaign
We start from the judiciary inquiries, explains Pierpaolo Farina, the project manager. Its the only way to have data that is compelling and precise: you have names, dates. Then we broaden the scope and keep researching, interviewing people and fact-checking everything.
Analysis includes books and other research materials, sometimes even oral history: in many cases, Im told, the everyday mafia victims do not make it to the news, so nobody writes about them.
Farina mentions the case of Pasquale Campanello, a prison guard in Poggioreale, Naples. A father of two, Campanello was only 32 when he was shot by four killers in 1993 for refusing to help convicted criminals receive messages and gifts from their outside accomplices. There are no books celebrating him, killed just for doing his job.
The team went to talk to his widow and created a lasting trace of his sacrifice: now WikiMafia has an article on Campanello and he will soon be on the map.
WikiMafia cost about 150 euros and many hours of volunteer work. Since its inception, MafiaMaps has aimed to have a life of its own: We decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign to create a community that uses the app: it would be useless to develop it, otherwise, says Farina. At 26, he is one of the few graduates of the group, as well as a published writer and prolific blogger.
Colors correspond to various mafia groups: The Sicilian Cosa Nostra is purple; the Calabrian Ndrangheta is blue.
For months, the team studied other successful crowdfunding campaigns and then set up their own, with a number of intermediate goals: the first 10,000 euros will provide mapping for the Lombardy region, reaching the 20,000 threshold will allow them to map other two regions and so on. The final goal is 100,000 euros for all 20 regions.
We wish we had Kickstarter in Italy: it would make things so much easier! Farina jokes. But I interview them on a productive Monday morning: Farina has just returned from a popular morning radio show. We raised 400 euros in 10 minutes! he says. 
Next, MafiaMaps will go the start-up way, they say, looking for foundation grants, sponsors, and other forms of financial support. 
We do not want public money, in order to avoid the controversy that often arises for those who work on the matter: that you do it because you expect to live with government funding, Farina declared in an interview to prominent newspaper La Repubblica, earlier this month.
The Faculty of Political Science will soon give them a room to use as their headquarters and they are already in touch with a number of possible sponsors.
The campaign was launched on March 21 and has raised about 14,000 euros so far. As the final day is May 23, MafiaMaps will likely have only enough money to start mapping Lombardy. 
The guys do not seem worried: they have already started developing the app: Were gonna start with that and do it in the best way possible, says 23-year-old Hermes Mariani, a MafiaMaps co-founder from Lecco. We will release the app as scheduled, next March. When people will see the results, they will want to help and support MafiaMaps in their region.
Allies
MafiaMaps will allow users to contribute, pointing out news, events, but it will be a selective crowdsourcing.
Well verify everything before putting it on a map, as we check carefully the contributions to WikiMafia, 26-year-old Samuele Motta clarifies. 
Many of them have studied the mafia for years and are critical of the sloppy work they often see on the issue. If you say everything is mafia-related, then its easier to argue that nothing is really mafia-related, says Claudio Ripamonti, a 20-year-old volunteer. They later explain that, in white-collar crimes, mafia affiliates are often a loose connection, but their role is often amplified. Also, despite many connections between mafia, politics, and enterprise, weve never been sued in two years of work, says Farina, laughing.
While big and small anti-mafia organizations are already supporting and contributing to the project, MafiaMaps has an ally in the Italian open data community, and, fittingly enough, from Sicily. Confiscati Bene (well confiscated) is a participatory project stimulate an effective re-use of buildings and other assets seized from the mafia. 
The project investigates their current condition and potential through the analysis of relevant data coming both from official sources and from bottom-up, citizen-monitoring initiatives, as previously reported on techPresident.
Sicily has the highest number of confiscated assets. The highest number in northern Italy is in Lombardy.
It is not an easy task, Confiscati Bene project manager Andrea Borruso tells Civicist in a Skype interview: Public datasets date back to 2013, many information are still missing and the quality hasnt improved at all in the past two years.
Confiscati Bene was born from a hackathon a little more than a year ago and has been nurtured by a small and active volunteer community. The founders recently created an association and are looking for a business model, Borruso says: This year has been great but this project, this topic, deserves more, it deserves actual everyday work...instead of nights!
Hes only half-joking: Borruso says that their work got them prizes and acknowledgments (they were mentioned as a best practice by former World Bank open data specialist Samuel Lee during the last PDF Italy) but it hasnt got any easier in the 14 months since Confiscati Benes inception.
And the Italian institutions are not helping: Weve recently been told that the agency [ANBSC, the Italian National Agency for the Management and Disposal of Assets Seized and Confiscated from Organised Crime] is updating the data but at the moment nothing is available, not even the old datasets, he explains.
As I write, an independent and volunteer initiative is the only place showing the national datasets of the confiscated assets, while the government page displays a coming soon sign.
In Italy, civic antibodies work!
For many years, the mafia was perceived as only affecting the south of Italy and as a rough, unrefined form of organized crime. Inquiries and trials in the early 90s showed a rather sophisticated systems with ramification all over the country and abroad, including the United States.
One of the most prominent judges at the time, Giovanni Falcone, worked closely with the FBI, the NYPD, and federal prosecutors in a case known as the Pizza Connection, busting an international heroin smuggling ring that laundered drug money through pizza parlors. (His statue can be found at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.)
The fact that this kind of project started in northern Italy is quite significant: Were proving that civic antibodies work, says Farina, a reference to the common metaphor of the mafia as Italys disease.
Still, its not easy to talk about it: We recently presented MafiaMaps in my hometown, adds Mariani. People came to us saying that they know the mafia is there, but its better not to know all these things. We wanna show them theyre wrong.
The MafiaMaps team follow the words of Judge Falcone, displayed on their website: The mafia is not invincible, it is a human fact, therefore, it has a beginning and an end.
One of the heroes of the anti-mafia movement, Falcone was killed with his wife and three police officers in 1992: his car exploded as he was reaching his native Palermo.
Italy has been called the mafia country for many years. Were very proud when were interviewed by foreign media and hear that were now the country with a strong anti-mafia movement, says Pierpaolo Farina at the end of our interview.
Last Monday, Judge Falcone would have turned 76. Saturday will mark the 23rd anniversary of his death.
It will also be the last day of the MafiaMaps fundraising campaign.

CrowdsourcingMappingOpen Data 



This interview originally appeared on the Brookings Institutions TechTank blog.
Cities are gaining momentum as incubators for innovation. There is much excitement about the idea of cities as laboratories of democracy. As a result, cities can learn best practices from one another. Sharing this information can build a strong foundation to amplify and encourage experimentation.
Recognizing the power of shared learning, Bloomberg Philanthropies, in partnership with The Behavioral Insights Team, Harvard Kennedy School, Johns Hopkins, Results for America, and the Sunlight Foundation, have recently launched an exciting initiative. What Works Cities is pledging $42 million to target 100 mid-sized cities, with populations between 100 thousand and 1 million, to help these localities develop solutions for their biggest challenges using evidence-based data.
I recently talked with Michele Jolin, CEO and co-founder of Results for America, whos also the campaign manager for Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities effort. We discussed the opportunities and potential for this initiative:
What was the impetus for this initiative?
From many of Bloomberg Philanthropies Government Innovation initiatives, they learned that city leaders are hungry to do more and do better with data and evidence, but they often struggle to access the relevant tools, knowledge and expertise required for implementation. Americas mid-sized cities (100,000-1,000,000 citizens) typically have little support to help them enhance how they use data and evidence, but they are eager to learn from experts and from one another about how to be more efficient and effective. What Works Cities was created to respond to this need and to improve the ability of mayors and local leaders to deliver results for citizens.
How will the cities be chosen?
We are looking to partner with cities that represent a cross-section of the country, reflecting diverse geographies, demographics, and politics. We also hope to work with cities in various stages of implementing What Works strategies. Most importantly, we are looking to work with mayors and local leaders who are truly committed to enhancing how they can use data and evidence to make their government more effective, improve peoples lives and engage the public.
How can this approach ameliorate some of the current challenges of employing innovation?
Theres already a tremendous amount of forward motion in Americas cities to open up their data, use evidence to ensure services are continuously improving and facilitate innovation, while also enhancing governments transparency and accountability to the public. This initiative was designed to put additional wind behind mayors backs and to define a new level of achievement for American city government. What Works Cities will demonstrate that when city governments across America use data and evidence to drive decisions and engage with citizens, they will achieve more for all their residents.
How do you envision training people who may be less familiar with technology?
Not surprisingly, the level of technological sophistication varies among city governments across the country. Where cities want to advance their knowledge and practice using technology, we will make available significant technological expertise from our partners. The Sunlight Foundation, for example, has extensive knowledge and experience in expanding open data policies to governments at all levels. And the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University has some of the leading minds in open data portals and performance management systems and is ready to work with cities interested in putting in place new systems or improving what they currently have in place. Cities have been partnering with their residents to use data to improve the delivery of services for themselves and their neighbors, and What Works Cities is there to help cities advance their practices and know-how, capitalizing on existing momentum
What does success look like?
At the end of three years, we hope to have accelerated the effective use of data and evidence in at least 100 cities, and supported Mayors in their efforts to get better results for all citizens. We also will point to examples of What Works strategies in cities all across the country, so that every Mayor will have examples and models that can be used for how to successfully use data and evidence to improve the lives of residents.
How can cities apply to be a What Works City?
Cities can find more information and apply for What Works Cities on our website. The first What Works Cities will be selected in mid-June based on applications received by June 1. However, cities will have multiple opportunities to apply over the course of the three-year initiative.

The Peoples Climate March last fall in New York City was a monumental feat of organizing prowess. Seasoned environmentalists from big-budget nonprofits worked with grassroots activists from scrappy community-based groups to pull together the largest environmental demonstration in history. The motto To change everything, we need everyone was prominently displayed on the homepage of PeoplesClimate.org. To encourage inclusivity, the international environmental group 350.org hired a contractor to implement an online platform that supported decentralized network organizing. The platform was an important tool for getting people, especially those outside New York City, to the march. It made it easy for anyone to participate, even if they were not a member of a big environmental group, through a system of hubs that invited people to join based on geographic-, religious-, community-, or issue-based identities. However, after the march was overafter the headlines had been madefinancial, technical, and administrative support for the hubs ended, in spite of declarations that the march would be about more than just a single day.

When I first wrote about the Peoples Climate March last fall, Tammy Shapiro, the person contracted by 350.org to oversee organizing on the hubs platform, said she hoped that it would stay online after the march as a resource for future climate change activism. Shapiro had worked on an earlier iteration of the hubs platform called InterOccupy, and saw the critical part it had played in Occupy Sandy, even after Occupy Wall Street had allegedly died. Shapiro hoped that the hubs platform could be a similar springboard for climate actions post-march.
Technically, the hubs platform is still online. The hubs are still listed; at least a few are still active. However, the link to start a new hub is broken, and if hub coordinators run into a problem, technical or otherwise, there is nobody responsible for assisting them.
Clicking on the link to start a new hub takes you here.
Phil Aroneanu, a co-founder of 350.org, and Matt Leonard, 350.orgs director of special projects, point out that march organizers, including 350.org, never intended to create a new Peoples Climate organization; it was a temporary coalition brought together by the powerful idea of putting on the largest climate demonstration in history. The hubs were, by their account, meant to be similarly short-lived. But even if it was not 350.orgs responsibility to support the hubs indefinitely (although they are covering the costs of keeping PeoplesClimate.org online), opting out of them was a missed opportunity. If the march was really about action, not words, dismantling infrastructure that could support that workby neglect at least, if not intentional disassemblyis the last thing an environmental organization trying to support a movement would want to do.

A place at the table
To be clear, we are not talking about a particularly high-tech platform. The default hub homepage prompted coordinators to describe each hubs mission (for example, the Skaters wanted to roll forward with real progress on climate action). Each hub had buttons for people to join its listserv, to RSVP to the march, to join a Facebook group, and a space for a blog. Funding for the hubs also covered MaestroConference calls. But however simple, the hubs were also highly customizable. Hub coordinators took advantage of this to varying degrees. Compare, for example, the Peoples Climate Art and the Nuclear-Free Carbon-Free hubs with the more bare-bones hubs for Canadians and Workers.
A basic hub page for Climate Literacy.
What made the hubs unique was that they were set up to facilitate organizing free of organizational ties. In the run-up to the march, an anti-fracking group asked Shapiro to create a hub for them, but she refused and suggested they start a generic anti-fracking hub instead. There is no hub for Greenpeace or the Sierra Club, but there are hubs for Pagans, Beekeepers, Anti-Capitalists, Grad Students for Climate Justice, and the Deep South.
Christopher Wahmhoff, a hub coordinator from Kalamazoo, Michigan, believes the platform forced large NGOs to play a hand with the small guys. After the 2010 oil spill in the Kalamazoo River, Wahmhoff recalls that all of the big environmental organizations used the disaster to ask for donations, without coordinating with local groups. We never really got to have a voice in our own oil spill, he tells Civicist.
But in the run-up to the march Wahmhoff says, We got to sit at the same table.
In a nearly 10,000-word post-mortem on the hubs, provided to Civicist, Tammy Shapiro notes that some of the hub coordinators were members of national nonprofits that found the hub system more inclusive, diverse, and connected than their individual organizations.
The Maryland hub coordinator, and a Sierra Club organizer, Seth Bush, reported that, The hubs were an opportunity to work past the traditional Sierra Club folks, and bring in more people from more diverse areas. We want a forum that is connecting all of these [regional] groups in a sustainable way that isnt just Sierra Clubs organizational motives but more creative and from the bottom up.
Hubs provided a really great front door for unaffiliated people to come into the movement and find their people, people they didnt know previously, says Gan Golan, an artist and activist who studies decentralized network organizing with Shapiro at the Movement Net Lab. Golan was involved in the arts mobilization for the march.
When you start to create self-organizing on the basis of peoples self-affinity, Golan adds, that is a solid bedrock...people want to maintain those connections.

Not a particularly meaningful investment to exist in perpetuity
Traditionally a lot of big products from the environmental movement come from very defined coalitions, Matt Leonard, 350.orgs product manager for the march, tells Civicist. We very intentionally wanted to make the Peoples Climate March bigger than that. Implementing the hubs system was one of the ways 350.org and other march organizers tried to make the march more inclusive.
Leonard says that the idea of the hubs was met with a lot of skepticism within 350.org. [But] the ones of us who did have a background in grassroots organizing did push for this, he adds.
(Back during the planning period for the march, Shapiro and her colleagues at Movement Net Lab pitched the hubs to march leadership as part of a larger suite of organizing strategies and tools. Although their ideas were not incorporated in their entirety, Shapiro and her colleagues, including Golan, were hired as individuals by different parts of the march organizing body.)
As for what happened to the hubs after the march, Leonard says, Understandably, some of them dissolved, citing a lack of motivation to continue organizing.
However, Leonard confirmed to Civicist that it was a deliberate decision to not give centralized support to the hubs post-march.
Phil Aroneanu, a co-founder of 350.org, tells Civicist that the hubs worked because people had a common goal: Everybody knew what their job was which was to get their people out [to the march].
Although Aroneanu did not exactly disparage the value of the hubs, he did not lavish the platform with praise, saying, The hubs are one of many ways that people got engaged in the climate march.
He  adds:
One of the issues that we run into a lot, especially in digital organizing, [is]: lets just put a platform out there and see if people come to it and organize themselves. As a traditional organizer, I find that to be a crazy idea. People dont join a network just to join a network.

Aroneanu says that the hubs worked well in places with little pre-existing organizing, like Syracuse, New York, but were less effective in cities like Washington, D.C., where activists had already worked together.
Hubs are one of the ways that...certain kinds of people can get involved and feel like they have agency in the work, Aroneanu says. At another point in our conversation he makes clear that he means entrepreneurial types.
But Aroneanu returns to the idea that the platform worked because everyone had something to work for, explaining that the self-organizing space is most useful when there is a common goal across the network.
It is not a particularly meaningful investment to exist in perpetuity, he tells Civicist.
However, Shapiros review of the hubs platform, which incorporated feedback from 42 individual hubs through a group call, a post-march survey, and one-on-one interviews, found that coordinators did want to continue using the hubs, for various reasons.
Mobilize at a hat drop
Frank Regan was the hub coordinator for Western New York, in addition to being the former chair of the Rochester Sierra Club. In the process of organizing people to attend the climate march, he helped form the Rochester Peoples Climate Coalition (RPCC), which was made up of more than 30 groups.
If you know anything about Rochester, he tells Civicist, [thats] really unusual.
In the run-up to the march, Regan invited local media outlets to come to a press conference the coalition held about the importance of the Peoples Climate March, but only one media outlet showed. So Regan videotaped it himself and used the hubs to post the clip and a write-up.
I think its a fantastic idea to become the media because the media is doing a terrible job, he tells Civicist. He wanted the hubs platform to be a place to become the media and expressed his disappointment that the hubs are kind of petering out.
Still, the Western New York hub is one of those that has not petered out entirely; last month Regan used it to promote the first major event held by the RPCC, Earth Week.
Of the 23 coordinators who responded to a survey Tammy Shapiro sent out after the march, Regan was one of 11 coordinators who told her that they planned on using the hub after the march; eight others said they might use it.
The anti-nuclear hub told Shapiro that they would like to continue using the hub so when big climate or nuclear moments come up they can mobilize at a hat drop.
This response alone makes a strong argument for maintaining the hubs. Hub coordinators put time, effort, and energy into forging connections between groups and individuals who share a community, identity, or passion. Its not clear why a movement organization, like 350.org, would want to let those groups go fallow, only to do all that work again the next time consensus and strength in numbers is needed.
Attempting to answer this question, Gan Golan tells Civicist:
Generally speaking, political parties and campaign organizations can feel threatened by autonomous organizing and can sometimes be hesitant to encourage the base to start organizing on their own terms...part of that is a fear of crazies but also a lack of faith that there is as much intelligence in the base as in the organizations.

So many moving pieces
The hubs system was not flawless; far from it. Shapiro herself catalogues a long list of problems and places the platform fell short. Hub coordinators, once self-selected, were all-but-impossible to oust (although you could add coordinators if someone fell off the map entirely), and there was no accountability system to ensure they were doing their job well. The platform was not set up to easily share information between hubs, so it was hard for coordinators to organize solidarity efforts with other hubs; it was also hard for hub coordinators to find and contact specific individuals. Because the various tools incorporated into the hubs platform were not integrated well, coordinators had to post updates and information separately in each forum (Facebook, Google Group, blog, etc.).
A partial list of hubs.
But the main problem, Shapiro tells Civicist, was a lack of organizing capacity. And hub coordinators felt it. Christopher Wahmhoff, the coordinator from Kalamazoo, told Civicist that although the hubs platform was like a candyland of organizing, that he felt like he didnt have enough energy to take advantage...[of] so many moving pieces.
With more time (the hubs got off the ground just two months before the march) and support staff (it was really just me, Shapiro says), Shapiro could have worked more with coordinators to ensure that they knew how to best leverage the tools at their disposal. As it was, Shapiro could barely keep up with the requests to form hubs. They launched the platform with a backlog of requests and struggled to keep up as more flowed in.
When asked what she would have done differently with more time and resources, Shapiro says:
So many things. I would have started a lot earlier. I would have built a different system that had a front page that could pull in information from...the whole network. I would have been more intentional about finding coordinators and working more with existing coordinators. I would have integrated the hubs more with the rest of organizing.

When asked to elaborate, she says that the hubs were viewed as a something apart from other mobilizing strategies, instead of something meant to be integrated into the entire effort.
Finally, she says she would have a larger staff, saying at bare minimum you need a tech person, an administrator, and an organizer, and we only had me and it was not good.
Missed opportunities
Shapiro says that failing to invest more in the hubs was not the only post-march failure: There was lots of organizing and infrastructure that we created for the march that wasnt maintained.
Shapiro says that the point of a big event like the march is to rally supporters and like-minded people and then channel that energy into another event, another action; into a movement.

She continues:
While the organizations that helped plan the march were able to build off that momentum in their own organizing, there were a lot of people who participated in the march who werent a part of one of those organizations and they didnt necessarily have a way to participate after. The hubs could have been one of the answers but there were other answers as well that werent necessarily used.

In a follow-up email to Civicist, Phil Aroneanu explained that after the march there was literally no more money to spendall of the resources raised by various organizations had been used to mobilize towards the march. The question is, if the march was about powering a movement, why didnt the organizing parties set aside resources for sustaining that movement post-march?
What happened to the hubs platform makes clear that there is a need for tools and platforms to support and build movements that exist outside of traditional organizations, free from funding whims and windfalls or lack thereof. But it also underscores the fact that these tools will need administrators and facilitators. If there is one thing everyone I spoke to for this story could agree on, it is that you cant just build it and expect them to come.
In a follow-up piece, Civicist will report on the work Shapiro, Golan and others are doing at Movement Net Lab studying and designing organizing strategies and other tools to support decentralized network movements.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has long been popular online, and as Nick Corasaniti of the New York Times reports, the reason is that he has the quirky sharing style of writing his own, often long, observations and quotations. Talk about the view from nowhere style of journalism: at no point in his well-reported story does Corasaniti consider the possibility that Sanders Facebook posts get hundreds of thousands of likes and often vault to the front page of Reddit because the ideas in themquestioning Americas huge military spending, making Election Day a national holiday, criticizing free trade agreementsare actually popular.


Its worth noting that if you went to the New York Times websites politics page this morning to try to find Corasanitis story, which got plenty of column inches in the print paper, youll have troubleits buried by the Times web editors in a More headlines section underneath several Hillary Clinton stories, including a listicle entitled 5 Things You Might Not Know About Hillary Clinton.

He, along with other industry heads, is criticizing the EPA for using social media, in conjunction with the Sierra Club and Organizing for Action, to promote its proposed clean water rule, report Eric Lipton and Coral Davenport for the New York Times. The effort, which was led by a former Obama 2012 media operative, Thomas Reynolds, used Thunderclap to reach 1.8 million people, along with blog posts and other social media. But its not clear the EPA broke the federal anti-lobbying statute, which prevents government agencies from urging the public to pressure their elected representatives, since the campaignwhich was pushing against industry efforts to #ditchtherule, was aimed at getting people to submit public comments to the agency about it.

Personal Democracy Forum is in less than three weeks, and were reaching out to some of the speakers for a quick preview of their respective talks and panels. First up is Ethan Roeder, who ran the data department for the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012. Roeder stopped by Civic Hall yesterday to lead a brown bag lunch talk on political campaigns and data. We caught up with him afterwards to ask a few questions about the PDF panel hell be moderating, on the future of political analytics.

Youre moderating a bipartisan panel at Personal Democracy Forum on the digital politics of 2016, featuring campaign consultants and analysts Scott Tranter, Kass Devorsey, and Masa Aida. What questions are you going to raise?
The thing that Im most interested in is the relationship between outside actors (like I360, Civis, and BlueLabs). The second thing would be innovations in analytics. One of the things Ive heard is that building an individual-level candidate support model is a trivial affair in 2014. If building an individual-level of support model is no longer an advantage, what is?
Roeder mentioned that he hasnt yet figured out if hes going to ask a framing question to get the panel started, and if so, what it will be. Perhaps people with strong opinions on the subject could offer suggestions in the comments.
What questions should the media ask campaigns about their use of data this election cycle?
Heres what I hope doesnt happen. As I mentioned in the talk, in 2012 we did a very effective job at hosing the media. And as a result they just came up with their own narratives. It wasnt necessarily in our best interest but we effectively deflected all of their questions
What I would hate to see happen is the media learn all the wrong lessons from that. Like Micah said, I hope they just dont ask, Does he have a Pinterest page? There is a Does he have a Pinterest page equivalent for data, technology, and analytics. For example, Are you using online data to target people? Of course theyre using online data to target people.
I think that journalists should be pushing campaigns to answer ethical questions about the work theyre doing. Is there a line you wont cross? Thats the question I would ask. If you cant give me a definition of your own understanding of the lines you wont cross, it probably means youre crossing a line.
Im less interested in the privacy question than Micah is, although that is a conversation that should happen. Im more interested in the ethics.
Did you run into any ethically dubious activities when you were working on campaigns?
No specific instances.
Campaigns exist to win. The only motivation of a campaign is to win. The only ethics of a campaign is whatever wont hurt their chances of winning. Im less interested in naughty things a particular campaign staffer did, and more interested in asking What is your ethical compass? How do you determine what you will or wont do? I dont think campaigns have an answer to that.

Nevertheless, when in Iowa Saturday, Bush told reporters that he was definitely going to compete for the states caucus-goers, saying, Why would I be here if I wasnt going to compete in Iowa? As Eli Stokols reports for Politico, Bush added, Whats relevant is running a campaign, creating a strategy, building a good team towards success, which is in the primaries, and doing it in a way that makes it possible to win the general, which is the whole point of this.

If you are frustrated with how your organization manages its technology tools, read this conversation between Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association digital consultant Sam Dorman and Greenpeace Mobilization Labs Michael Silberman. Dorman is onto something critical: the need to build a digital product team...to make sure your organization is using great, high-quality technology that is fully aligned with what youre trying to accomplish. This excerpt gives some flavor of what he means:
Most groups love their website on the day they launch it. But theres usually very little investment in it after that. And meanwhile, everything else is changing around it so every day the website gets a little bit farther and farther out of date. Eventually, the website becomes a huge source of frustration and embarrassment, and gets in the way of people doing their jobs. Then eventually you knock the whole thing down and spend a huge amount of time and money starting the whole cycle over again. The problem is, you only had this brief window of time where you actually loved your website and were getting good value from it! A product approach to the website is different. Instead of just letting it slip into decline, you admit that a website needs continued focus and continued resources in order to stay useful and relevant and secure, and even stylish. So yes, youre investing more in it, but at least you know it will continue to deliver much better value as your organization changes and the world changes around it. And then along the way you are fixing all of these points of frustration for staff and keeping the technology strong underneath.

One of the realities of being a chief data officer is that your day is often filled with meetings where you are the least popular person in the room.
Working with government agencies to release dataparticularly if agencies are new to the open data process, or if the data in question has not been released beforecan be challenging. Releasing open data can invite scrutiny of agency operations from the public and the media. Agencies may view releasing open data as falling outside of their core mission, particularly if their plate is already full and there is little or no funding to support the work that needs to be done to make data available.
Working with agencies to release data can be a lonely job.
But chief data officers are not the only ones working with agencies to release data that they may be disinclined to make available. Governments that have a PerformanceStat program (often called CitiStat or StateStat) may also face the challenge of collecting data from agencies so that they can evaluate their performance and ask questions about how they might fulfill their missions more effectively.
The data collection duties of a PerformanceStat staffer can mirror that of a chief data officer in many ways. In my experience, however, there is often little collaboration and cooperation among these two functions. Much the same way that governments typically operate their FOIA process, these two data-centric functions happen in their own silos with little strategic connection between the two.
Two Is The Loneliest Number
For the PerformanceStat strategy to produce meaningful results, it needs a few analytical people working on it full-time to understandthrough the use of datawhat kind of results are really being produced.

Robert Behn, The Seven Big Errors of PerformanceStat
For much of my time as Philadelphias chief data officer, my office was right next door to a woman who worked as part of the team supporting the citys PhillyStat program. I observed that much of her time was spent asking different city agencies to provide updated information in preparation for an upcoming PhillyStat meeting, where senior management would review and evaluate the data with the agency.
I was also on the receiving end of requests for information, when it was time for the agency I worked for to prepare for its own PhillyStat meeting. This usually boiled down to providing statistics on how many new datasets had been released as part of the citys open data efforts. There was very little inquiry into the kinds of data that we had released, the quality of that data, or how highly demanded that data had been.
But the two of us, my office neighbor and I, never discussed how our efforts to work with agencies to release different kinds of data could compliment and support each other. We never really got a chance to talk about how we were both working toward the same overarching goalto get agencies to use data to do their jobs more effectively.
I look back on this experience as an enormous missed opportunity.
Turbocharging CityStat
There are four things anyone working in a CityStat or StateStat program should know about open data.
Open Makes Data Better
Data transparency can help drive data quality. When there are many eyes on a specific dataset, and multiple users accessing it, any inconsistencies or issues with the data get surfaced quickly for discussion. See this thread on the City of Philadelphias open data forum for an example of how this works in practice. One of the best remedies for dirty data is transparency.
Publishing open data is like altitude training for data sharing. Agencies that publish open data become much better at all kinds of data sharing. Train your agencies to get better at data sharing by encouraging them to make regular releases of open data.
Openness Enhances Discoverability
When data is open it obviates the need for special relationships or political clout to obtain it. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use, so few resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.
As noted in a 2013 data analytics report from the City of New York, aggregating cross-agency data is often first a political, legal, and cultural discussion (rather than a technical one). Whether created by statute, executive order or some other vehicle, open data directives send a clear message to the bureaucracy that data sharing is not only beneficial, but expected.
CitiStat officials can dramatically improve their interactions with agencies by supplementing the data they provide with additional sources that provide insight into agency operations. For example, when reviewing the agency that issues building permits in a jurisdiction, wouldnt it be nice to know if some of those applicants had been tax delinquent?
Finding the Truth in the Data
One of the most important assets of an open data program is the community around it. This community can be invaluable in helping find useful, actionable observations in data. The community can also be invaluable in helping determine if data reflects reality.
Should that 311 service request actually have been closed out, or does the issue still exist? Did refuse collection happen in a specific neighborhood as scheduled? Is that plot of vacant land actually being used for something? Are the trains really running on time?
These are all important questionsessential to determining if an agency is fulfilling its missing and meeting its performance objectives. But they are all questions that CitiStat officials could use the communitys help in answering accurately and completely. Despite what the data may say, there are cases where the real truth is on the ground. And sometimes the only way to get that truth is by leveraging the community.
Communities can only converge and grow around data that is open.
Open Data as a Foundation for Better Engagement
(Flickr/rkeefer: CC BY 2.0)
At the beginning of my career in government, I worked for the New York State Senate. On my first trip to Albany, I got a tour of the Senate Chamber and a story about how work really got done in that chamber.
At the back of the Senate chamber are large fireplaces, no longer used, but large enough to suggest that they were used to heat the entire cavernous room at one time. My tour guide that day, a staffer who had been in Albany for many years, told me the story of how senators who wanted to have a conversation away from prying ears would duck into one of the fireplaces and do their horse trading.
It made me think of all of the people in the Senate gallerygroups that are paraded in each day to watch the Senate at workand how none of them were seeing the real business of government because they couldnt see (or hear) into the Senates large, ornate fireplaces.
As data increasingly becomes the foundation on which governments make decisions, we have an opportunity to bring unprecedented transparency to the governance process and engage citizens in a way we never could before.
CitiStat and other performance management programs are about using data to make better decisions in how government agencies operate. These operations inevitably come down to allocating finite resources between competing needs to (hopefully) make the biggest impact.
Which streets get plowed first? Which neighborhoods get more expansive police patrols? Which schools get closed first? Where will a new stadium be built?
Data-driven decision-making can help governments find the most equitable and efficient answer to these difficult questions. Making the data behind these decisions open is the key to a more engaged and informed citizenry.

The US House voted 338-88 for the USA Freedom Act, amending the Patriot Act to end the bulk collection of Americans phone metadata, Jennifer Steinhauer reports for The New York Times. Instead, that data would be held by private telcos, and the NSA or FBI would have to get the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to access it.


On Twitter, journalist Glenn Greenwald, who shared the Pulitzer Prize for exposing the NSAs surveillance programs, tweeted his praise for the news, saying First time since 9/11 that powers justified in the name of terrorism will be reduced rather than increased.


But CREDO Mobile, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future condemned the House members who backed the vote, saying that it wouldnt end mass surveillance and could actually provide legal immunity to companies that unlawfully provide the government with their customers information. Congress shouldnt reauthorize a surveillance program that a federal court just declared illegal. But the House voted to do just that by passing the USA Freedom Act which could provide legal authority to continue some of the surveillance practices the judiciary just struck down, said Becky Bond, Vice President of CREDO Mobile.


The ACLU says it still wants Section 215 of the Patriot Act to completely sunset, but that if the US Senate passes the USA Freedom Act, it should amend it to prevent surveillance of individuals with no nexus to terrorism, to ensure that irrelevant information is not held but immediately purged, and to add a public advocate role before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Botsparticularly bots on social mediacant seem to catch a break in the news lately. First, the Block Bot, a program designed to help Twitter users weed-out disliked content and people, simultaneously fell afoul of Richard Dawkins, members of the conservative press, and legal pundits. Next, an article in the MIT Technology Review outlined the ways social bots act as nefarious fake persuaders in online marketing and political communication. Forbes then published a lengthy profile piece on Distil Networks, a company championed by the publication as a battler of bad bots. Finally, a Slate piece outlined a slew of crooked, artificially stupid though dangerous, instances of automated software agent use.
Over the last several years, in fact, journalists have increasingly reported on cases of politicians using bots worldwide during contested elections and security crises to pad follower lists, spam and disable activists, and send out pro-government propaganda.
That unsavory actors are using bots globally to their advantage is not in question. However, most stories on this topic fail to ask the bigger question. Namely, is it the nature of bots that makes their usage inherently problematic? Or, rather, is it the means used by the bots to achieve their ends and the intent behind them which makes them so objectionable?
Deeper digging quickly reveals that there are beneficial bots of all kinds in operation on social media. Bots have been used to facilitate protest and have seen action in critiquing injustice. Consider Zach Whalens Twitter bot, @clearcongress, which works to highlight astronomically low congressional approval levels. Or @congressedits, which tweets every time someone at a congressional IP address edits a Wikipedia page. Bots can be used to keep powerful political actors in check.
By providing automated monitoring, bots can act as a type of social prosthesis for communities of users online. Communities lacking human users to track and publicize political action can now make use of bots whichin the words of one journalistradiate information automatically. This substitutes to some degree the role of the current events obsessed newshound typically played by humans in a community of users online. This can be important, as in the case of the congressional monitoring bots, and whimsical, as in the case of @stealthmountain, which creates a synthetic grammar nazi of sorts on Twitter.
It is true that these bots may not be able to provide the deep analysis that a professional journalist would provide, but they generate awareness of issues where there previously was an information vacuum. To that end, well-deployed bots can help resolve an increasingly obvious challenge facing social media platforms: that the self-segregating nature of connections online tend to produce echo chambers that prevent people from receiving a diverse set of information. Even in cases where journalists and engaged activists exist and take part in online conversation, bots can work to support these efforts and in some cases surpass them in supplying and processing information.
Bots and autonomous systems can also be used in reverse, to shield users against the emergent group behaviors on social media which work to dismantle productive discourse. James Poulos of the Daily Beast highlighted these sorts of programs in an article written in support of Block Bot. His argument is that this bot helps users to see how breaking down boundaries isnt the panacea our creative and optimistic culture so often claims it to be. Rather, Poulos suggests, the same software used to proliferate spam and manipulate public opinion can be used to limit peoples exposure to toxic, often hateful and abusive, speech online.
It may become necessary to deploy these technologies. Twitter, Facebook, and others are unlikely to take aggressive and comprehensive actions to resolve issues like harassment and the emergence of echo chambers on their platforms. Despite having the most control over their respective platforms, taking action on these issues would force platforms to wade into the messy politics of playing referee in controversies. By maintaining a position of neutrality (some would argue negligence), the responsibilityand blamecontinues to rest on users, and not on platforms.
Moreover, as bad actors become more effective with using bots to shape social activity online, the need for good bots may become ever more important. Online social movements may be able to combat bots manually when they are obvious and spam messages in predictable ways. They may not be so successful when swarms of realistic looking identities may be used to conduct long term and subtle campaigns of infiltration in the future.
It is important not to slip into the complacent cocoon of solutionism with this line of pro-bot argument. As some commentators have worried, good bots can look like spam and actually erode the social capital of burgeoning movements online. Automation is powerful. Like the deployment of robots in the physical world, the most effective uses will come with careful study and smart designs that are sensitive to the needs and perceptions of communities.
Bots which declare their purpose and that they are bots, for instance, would add a layer of transparency that better sets the expectations of the communities they interact with. Bots also might be designed as a kind of community scaffolding, prodding and encouraging when a movement is small, but then deactivating gracefully as people rally to a cause to avoid introducing spam into a conversation.
The failure of the good bot is a failure of design, not a failure of automation. Our discourse would be more productive if it focused on the qualities that make bots the right tool for the job from a social and ethical standpoint, rather than ceding the promise of this technology to those who would use them for ill.

To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
On a recent trip to Hong Kong, I passed through the stronghold encampment outside the Central Government Offices. Though most of Occupy Central had been dispersed by police months prior, a core group of protesters continued their occupation. I wasnt the only foreigner who visited; there was a board filled with affirmations of support written on sticky notes. Most appeared to come from peers, but a number were from Taiwan. I even saw a few in English: Big support from Vancouver and Halifax. We are in solidarity. The world is watching and supporting you. Never give up!
These messages reflect Hong Kongs status as a global city, one filled with international travelers for business and tourism. But it was just one way people from around the world have found ways to show their support for the Umbrella Movement. For every sticky note on that board, there have been countless tweets, status updates, and other short notes of support sent via the internet.
When I think of civic tech, I think first of the expanding definition of what it means to engage in civic action today. The word civic is anchored in the Latin for citizen, which has historically implied formal citizenship in a city or nation-state. But as Hasan Altinay argues so eloquently, we need a global civics that acknowledges our interdependent world.
This is critical to keep in mind with regards to technology. The hardware we buy and throw out relies on global shipping, manufacturing, and disposal networks that span continents and countries, and the software we rely on is often made possible thanks to globally-distributed teams, outsourced labor and complex infrastructure that crisscrosses oceans and orbits. Likewise, the civic technologies we build can have both intentional and unintentional impacts far from where they were originally designed.
The costs of international travel and communications have dropped precipitously, and social networks are forming across broad and diverse geographies and cultures. In other words, tech has played a key role in expanding many peoples notion of civic participation to include broader swaths of the globe. Developing a deeper understanding of what global citizenship can look and feel like in the 21st century should be a key part of developing responsible and effective civic technology.
In this regard, when I think of civic tech, I think secondly of the pairing of these particular words. Referring to new technologies as civic makes clear the intentions of the makersthat those building tools or processes have the intention of facilitating actions for a public good. They could be small, symbolic actionsposting a selfie to show support for a causeor large, potentially long-term actionshelping transform city data models to support open APIs.
Importantly, understanding intent gives us a framework to evaluate the success of the project. In other words, not only should a civic tech project meet all the usual standards by which we can evaluate successful implementatione.g., quality user experience, stable code, sustainable business model, etc.,but it should also facilitate peoples ability to engage in civic action, however broadly that might be defined.
For many in the civic tech space, this might seem obvious, but much of the technology industry operates with a techno-optimistic mythos. This mythos carries the assumption that what we build with new technologies will necessarily change the world for the better. Yes, tech has certainly changed the world, but its positive impact is by no means a given. That which gives power to the powerless can also reinforce the very social, economic and political structures that serve the powerful.
Every time I check my social media feeds, I see global solidarity networks developing rapidly for any number of causes and issues, from racial justice to queer rights to net neutrality. Altinay argues that universities should be a key site for fostering global civics, and I think the technology has a key role here, too. Tech in general has allowed us to participate online with movements halfway around the world and in different parts of the country, whether through symbolic and important gestures of affirmation and or through loose coalitions for support and advocacy. What is the role of civic tech in this space? How can it help foster a broader sense of public good and a global sense of civic engagement?

Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the collection of phone records deemed relevant to a national security case, cannot be interpreted to mean that it authorizes the collection of all Americans phone records, a three-judge appeals court has unanimously ruled, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Weisman report for the New York Times. It remains to be seen how this ruling will affect the ongoing debate in Congress about reauthorizing the act.


National insecurity blogger Marcy Wheeler catches Senate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr sharing the previously undisclosed fact that the bulk data collection program doesnt only capture phone numbers, it also vacuums up IP addresses.


Big news from Facebookistan: Data scientists Eytan Bakshy, Solomon Messing and Lada Adamic have published a new peer-reviewed paper in Science that studied how 10.1 million adult US Facebook users interact with socially shared news, finding that self-identified liberals and conservatives do tend to cluster together and mostly share ideologically-consistent content, but that both groups also frequently encounter cross-cutting content. Bakshy et al. also find that while the News Feed algorithm definitely reduces the amount of cross-cutting content such users see, their own individual choices about what to click on has a somewhat larger role. In other words, the authors admit the filter bubble exists, but peoples bubbles overlap and to the degree partisan polarization is happening on Facebook, its more the fault of users than it is of the algorithm.


In the New York Times, Farhad Manjoo does an admirable job of summarizing the study and the debate that it has sparked, considering that he is writing for the Business section of the New York Times. (Most of Americas mainstream media walks very gingerly around critical reporting of Facebook and News Feed, given that the social network giant sits like a jovial overweight mob boss on their jugular vein, able to choke their online traffic at whim, or even by accident. Nice news business you have there...it would be a shame if anything happened to it.)


Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy and the author of the book The Filter Bubble, comments on Medium that Facebooks effort to downplay its algorithms sorting power is an overstatement. He adds, Certainly, who your friends are matters a lot in social media. But the fact that the algorithms narrowing effect is nearly as strong as our own avoidance of views we disagree with suggests that its actually a pretty big deal.


Technosociologist Zeynep Tufekci says the most important finding in the study is buried in an appendix that shows that the News Feed algorithm has tremendous power in affecting what users will actually click on. The higher the link, more (a lot more) likely it will be clicked on. You live and die by placement, determined by the newsfeed algorithm, she writes. (And Facebook continues to deny that it exercises editorial power, as Jay Rosen reminds us.) Tufecki also attacks Bakshy et al. for in effect trying to hide a new finding, that the News Feed algorithm reduces ideological diversity, behind an old, well-established finding, that people have a tendency to avoid content that challenges their beliefs.


University of Michigan information studies professor Christian Sandvig sums all this criticism up well, saying that the framing of the researchers findings suggest this should be referred to as Facebooks Its not our fault study. Plus, he (like Pariser and Tufekci) adds several important qualifiersmost important being that this is not a random study of all Facebook users, but ones of heavy users who self-report their political views on Facebook, something only 4 percent do in a way the researchers found interpretable.


In Crooked Timber, Eszter Hargittai rips the editors of Science for letting the Facebook researchers make broad and conclusive claims about such an unrepresentative sample.


Sandvig also notes the larger context:

Facebook is a private corporation with a terrible public relations problem. It is periodically rated one of the least popular companies in existence. It is currently facing serious government investigations into illegal practices in many countries, some of which stem from the manipulation of its news feed algorithm. In this context, I have to say that it doesnt seem wise for these Facebook researchers to have spun these data so hard in this direction, which I would summarize as: the algorithm is less selective and less polarizing. Particularly when the research finding in their own study is actually that the Facebook algorithm is modestly more selective and more polarizing than living your life without it.


Why this matters: University of Maryland media theorist and Snapchat researcher Nathan Jurgenson adds: Power and control are most efficiently maintained when they are made invisible. Facebooks ideological push to dismiss the very real ways they structure what users see and do is the company attempting to simultaneously embrace control and evade responsibility. Their news team doesnt need to be competent in journalism because they dont see themselves as doing journalism. But Facebook is doing journalism, and the way they code their algorithms and the rest of the site is structuring and shaping personal, social, and civic life. Like it or not, weve collectively handed very important civic roles to social media companies, the one I work for included, and a real danger is that we cant hope for them to be competent at these jobs when they wont even admit to doing them.


A footnote: Two of the authors of this study, Solomon Messing and Eytan Bakshy, are also responsible for Facebooks still unreleased study of the impact of changing the News Feed content for close to 2 million adult American users in the ten weeks leading up to the 2012 election (putting more hard news at the top of their feeds), increasing their interest in government and self-reported tendency to vote by 3 percent. Heres the story I did for Mother Jones last October on that. When I started asking Messing and Bakshy about two public talks their third colleague Lada Adamic had given about this fascinating intervention in the 2012 election, they moved quickly to have a video of one of Adamics talks removed from YouTube (I kept a copy here). According to Adamic, in that experiment, Messing tweaked the feeds of those users so that instead of seeing your regular news feed, if any of your friends had shared a news story, [Messing] would boost that news story so that it was up top [on your page] and you were much more likely to see it. A Facebook spokesman, Michael Buckley, told me that this study helped influence decisions inside Facebook to increase the hard news content of users News Feeds. Now that we have further confirmation from Facebook itself that the placement of items in News Feed is a powerful signal, plus the evidence that it can demonstrably increase voter participation, its time that Facebook opened itself up to independent engineering audits to ensure that its tweaking of the News Feed algorithm is actually random, blind, and politically neutral.


City Paper reporter Emily Guendelsberger went undercover as an UberX driver in Philadelphia and discovered that she made about $9.34 an hour, meaning that working ten hours a day, six days a week shed net almost $30,000 a year before taxes. Some life!


Why do todays tech oligarchs repeatedly cite those fishermen off the coast of Africa who use their mobile phones to find the market with the best price to sell their catch as proof that high-tech isnt mainly helping a new class of super-rich get richer? That quote could have been from Facebooks Mark Zuckerbergs defense earlier this week of Internet.org, but actually is from Googles executive chairman Eric Schmidt and his Google Ideas sidekick Jared Cohen, writing in the Huffington Post about how data science and machine learning will enable computers to move beyond their current role as our assistants, and become our advisors. Its the kind of exciting vision one can only have from the vantage point that sees the coast of Africa as some kind of unitary place.

First Post 



I came away from the Omidyar Networks Building the Business of Civic Tech event (which took place at Civic Hall earlier this year) with one very concrete piece of advice by and for civic tech startups: go to industry conferences. For years, weve advised political campaigns, news companies, and others to meet their audiences wherever they naturally congregate. If youre building govtech products and services, that might just be a conference with more suit jackets than track jackets.
A panel discussion during the Omidyar Networks Building the Business of Civic Tech conference in April.
Whichever sector of civic tech youre taking on, be it transportation, elections, payments, or procurement, chances are the people who have been doing that work for decades are already convening annually somewhere. That somewhere might not be in San Francisco. The average age might be older than most civic tech events. You should still go. This isnt my advice; its the happily-shared secret of several successful civic tech startups.
The Center for Technology & Civic Life team are regulars at events like IACREOT. Says founder Tiana Epps-Johnson, If youre not interested in a morning word puzzle, thats the International Association of Clerks, Recorders, Election Officials, and Treasurers. They also regularly attend state election association conferences like the New Jersey Association of Election Officials conference. Dont get the wrong impression, these things can still be plenty of fun: This years NJAEO was at Harrahs in Atlantic City, complete with St. Patricks Day festivities.
Industry conferences have obvious value to groups like the Center for Technology and Civic Life: a high density of customers, users, and partners getting into the nitty-gritty of their work. But travel, lodging, and registration add up quickly (not to mention the time away from building your company). The solution? Ensure you get invited as a speaker, rather than as a vendor or sponsor. Not only should this spare you a registration fee, it also gets you more exposure, and introduces you to the community as a savvy peer rather than a pay-to-play vendor.
Much of the inspiration for this post comes from Marci Harris of POPVOX (and a fellow Civicist contributing editor). Talk to her about civic tech startups, and shell bring up her dad. He lives and works in county government in Tennessee. And the way he learns about and decides to purchase govtech is a little old fashioned: Companies come and share their product with him.
Marci writes:
These are important places for local officials to meet each other, learn about new things, and make connections. I remember walking around the Tennessee Municipal League convention and being so impressed...As with any other convention/trade show, I picked up all the brochures, talked with the people in the booth, grabbed some business cards, and came back to tell my boss and the department heads about the cool new things I learned. The smart companies followed up with me after the event and we scheduled several meetings for them to come in and present to others in the city. Thats the way it works in any industry. Our civic startups need to get into the same system.

In case you dont have family in public service, Marci rattles off some public sector trade groups:

National League of Cities (the big one)
The International City/County Management Association (ICMA)
National Association of Counties (NACo  Happy National County Government Month!)
County Executives of America (CEA)
National Association of Election Officials
National Emergency Management Association
National Association of City Transportation Officials
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials

And thats just to start. Each of these associations has state chapters, like the League of California Cities (LCC).
Of course, most civic tech startups dont have the salesforce or the time necessary to hold conversations with tens of thousands of potential public sector customers, especially when theyre in their early stages. Sometimes, there are intense procurement processes and rigid cultural barriers preventing government from adopting promising govtech. Other times, the people making those decisions simply havent heard of you yet.
To ameliorate this situation, Microsoft, where I work as Director of Civic Technology, is thinking about how we can bring to bear our own resources to support govtech startups growth. Our CityNext initiative works with hundreds of partner companies offering nearly a thousand offerings to help cities accelerate innovation. Last December, CityNexts Jeff Friedman (who previously lead Philadelphias New Urban Mechanics) designed a public sector pitch day to showcase some great civic tech startups and get them in front of government technology purchasers. Formally, Microsoft Ventures calls it the Customer Access Program, aimed at introducing Microsofts customers with a portfolio of startups who we have identified as being todays top entrepreneurs. Think of it as the Demo Day at the end of an accelerator program, without the three months of forced coworking leading up to it. Were looking to replicate this successful event in New York City and other markets to help local govtech startups share what theyre doing with potential customers.
Another model I recently came across is the partner pilot. If youve launched a govtech startup, youre probably trying to do something in a new way. And public sector employees have lots of reasons to resist new ways of doing things. So some larger govtech partners are helping newer startups bring in business by inviting them to pilot new solutions with their own customers.
MeWe is a govtech company working to streamline regulatory inspections with a clean, friendly checklist app called CoInspect. Theyre exploring a structured pilot with Accela, working with one of Accelas existing municipal customers to test their mobile inspections application.
As civic tech startups face very real challenges of sustaining themselves and scaling to reach (and then reinvent) the massive public sector, we should keep an eye out for strategies and partnerships that put the wind at their backs.
Let me know in the comments if you know of other models for scaling govtech startups.

With Personal Democracy Forum 2015 just four weeks from now, were excited to share some updates on the conference program, a slew of new speakers, and the launch of the Civic Hall PDF Fellowship Program, which is now taking applications.
The big theme for PDF 2015 is Imagine All the People: The Future of Civic Tech, and we have an amazing array of speakers addressing that subject from a variety of angles. The main hall schedule is posted here.
On day one, June 4, the morning plenary talks will focus first on how to best engage citizens and governments in meaningful ways. Then well look at the relationship between tech, civic engagement, equality and empowerment, covering everything from new efforts to uplift workers to the civil rights and police reform movement to the net neutrality victory. And then, before lunch, well pivot to consider how tech can help design a more civil and nurturing society. After lunch and two rounds of breakout sessions, well reconvene at the end of the day for a series of provocative talks about the future, and what we should (or shouldnt) be worried about as big data and the Internet of Things further permeate our lives.
On day two, June 5, the morning plenary will focus again on the core work of civic tech, starting with a set of talks addressing several promising efforts to make our representative democracies work better. Then, after the morning coffee break, our speakers will focus on what it means to build with, not for and how to best listen to and serve our communities. After that, as we head into lunch, well hear from several champions of real change. Following the lunch break and two more rounds of breakouts, well return to the main hall for one more round of plenary keynotes, this time focused on the future of civic tech.
Weve confirmed more than 30 new speakers: Craig Aaron of Free Press, Kenneth Bailey of the Design Studio for Social Intervention, Liz Barry of Public Lab, Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post, Hannah Calhoon of Blue Ridge Labs, Tom Dougherty of Knowwho, Demond Drummer of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, Tiana Epps-Johnson of the Center for Technology and Civic Life, Bridgit Antoinette Evans of Fuel Change, Christopher Gates of the Sunlight Foundation, John Paul Farmer of Microsoft, Erhardt Graeff of MIT Media Lab, Ted Henderson to Capitol Bells, Kerri Kelly of CTZNWELL, Josh Koster of Chong & Koster, Seamus Kraft of the OpenGov Foundation, Luciana Lopez of Reuters, Mike Mathieu of FrontSeat, An Xiao Mina of Meedan, Andres Monroy-Hernandez of Microsoft, Rufus Pollock of the Open Knowledge Foundation, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA), Trebor Scholz of the New School, Nancy Scola of Politico, David Segal of DemandProgress, Andrew Slack of Imagine Better, Anne-Marie Slaughter of New America, Jessy Tolkan of Working Families Party, Jenn Topper of the Sunlight Foundation, John Webb of Google, Rachel Weidinger of Big Here, Paul Wescott of L2, Derek Willis of the New York Times, and Deanna Zandt of Lux Digital. And more are comingwatch this space for updates, including details on the more than two dozen breakout sessions we have in the works.
Last but not least, we are pleased to announce the Civic Hall 2015 PDF Fellowship program, which will cover full registration costs to the conference for ten innovators in the fields of creative, social, or political tech. To apply, fill out this brief survey. Applications are due by midnight May 17; all applicants will be notified on May 20.

Mitchell Baker, the CEO of the Mozilla Foundation, takes a close look at zero rating and explains clearly why it is a threat to the open internet. One half of zero rating (which is what Facebook is doing with Internet.org) is helping cover data charges for poor users, which she lauds. The other half, where the parts of the internet that are available for citizens to choose from is limited, and predetermined by those entities with financial power, Baker says is disastrous. She notes that yesterday Mozilla wrote to Prime Minister Modi of India supporting the open internet and stating that zero rating is not the right solution.


Mozilla Corporations senior VP for business and legal affairs Denelle Dixon-Thayer points out that there are alternatives to the Facebook Internet.org approach. She notes that in Bangladesh, a Mozilla partnership with Grameenphone allows users to receive 20MB of free data usage a day in exchange for viewing an ad, for example.


Related: Mozilla staffer Ben Moskowitz writes that Internet.org is offensive. Instead, he says,

Internet.org is neither the Internet, nor a charitable and development-oriented .org. Internet.org is now a carefully managed partnership program, through which Facebook has curatorial power similar to an app store.


And Josh Levy of Access writes in Wired that we should actually refer to Internet.org as Facebooknet.

Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has hired Revolution Messaging the lead his digital efforts, bringing on several veterans of Barack Obamas 2008 campaign, including RM founder Scott Goodstein (external online director for Obama 08 and the one-time keeper of @barackobama), Arun Chaudhary (new media road director in 08 and Obamas first official White House videographer), Shauna Daly (Obama 08 deputy research director), and Walker Hamilton (site architect for Obama 08). Kenneth Pennington, Sanders Senate social media director, is also joining the team. According to a release from Revolution Messaging, the Sanders campaign raised $3 million in its first four days, outperforming the current Republican field with 75,000 contributions averaging $43 each. 185,000 supporters have signed up at BernieSanders.com.


So far, Hillary Clintons campaign has released little information about its fundraising. And as Patrick Caldwell reports for Mother Jones, it also has yet to say anything about what it will reveal about its bundlers, those key individuals who frequently round up hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars in contributions on behalf of campaigns. The 2008 Clinton campaign released limited information about its bundlers, only offering a list of 324 people who pulled in $100,000 or more. The Obama campaign that year offered a more detailed list of 556 names broken into four monetary tiers. The 2012 Romney campaign released no bundler information.


With voters in Great Britain going to the polls, the BBCs Mike Wendling chews on that old bone, the so-called social media election (aka the Facebook election or the Twitter election etc.luckily here in the US were onto the Meerkat election). Far more likely its a data and analytics election, but so far weve seen little coverage of that critical element in digital campaigning.


Searching for his insights under the lamppost where the light is brightest, British digital analyst Carl Miller writes in Buzzfeed that lots of his compatriots are using social media to hurl curses at politicians.

Nick Bilton of the New York Times cites social science studies suggesting that wealth makes people self-centered and less empathetic to others to explain Silicon Valleys culture of self-absorption. Ya think?

Writing in NonProfit Quarterly, William Schambra of the Hudson Institutes Bradley Center for Philanthropy and Civic Renewal takes a sledgehammer to Laura Arrillaga-Andreessens stated belief that technology is in the nascent states of completely transforming philanthropy. Contrary to her assertion that technology is forcing the entire social sector to be more accountable and transparent about how every single one of our gifts is tangibly transforming individual lives, Schambra says that Human problems will not suddenly be solved by the clever flashes of out-of-the-box imagination so prized by technology and he calls for a a larger nonprofit insurgency against high-tech imperialism. And this: For too long...we have listened passively to insulting and patronizing lectures by the tech titans about the expansiveness of their vision compared to the timidity of ours, the efficacy of their tools compared to the crudeness of ours. Tell us how you really feel!


Commenting on Schambras rant, Inside Philanthropys David Callahan offers a semi-rebuttal, outlining Five Big Myths About Techies and Philanthropy. One choice bit:

Looking across tech philanthropy, I would say these funders are only marginally more interested in technology than other funders. In fact, over the past few months, Ive heard a lot more from legacy foundation leaders like Darren Walker about technology than anyone from Silicon Valley, and the big push in philanthropy on net neutrality has mainly come from those traditional funders. One of them, the Knight Foundation, is more infatuated with technology that any Silicon Valley foundation I know of.


Keynoting the Re:publica conference in Berlin yesterday, Ethan Zuckerman of the MIT Center of Civic Media gave a typically wonderful and broad-ranging talk about civics in the age of mistrust that is also a meditation on what we have gotten wrong about the internets potential to change politics for the better.


Taking a half-page from John Olivers advice to Edward Snowden on how to get Americans to care about the NSAs surveillance overreaching, Fight for the Future is calling on supporters to post pictures of themselves naked from the waist up, using the hashtag #IFEELNAKED to make Congress ashamed theyre watching us. The results are impressive. FFTF is also asking websites to install code that will prevent anyone from a Congressional IP address from seeing their sites, instead getting a splash page reading Stop Invading Our Private Lives.


Speaking of privacy innovations, the ACLU is trying to find out what kind of overhead surveillance city and federal authorities were conducting last week in Baltimore, after a random Twitter exchange between a resident and a local aviation buff unearthed some very curious data about a Cessna that kept flying over the West Baltimore epicenter of the protests, Craig Timberg reports for The Washington Post.

The Republican National Committee debate process, which calls for nine sanctioned debates, appears to have a similar exclusivity rule.

To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
Theres a running joke in the HBO comedy Silicon Valley, in which every new tech company is trying to make the world a better place. The punchline works every time because the typical Silicon Valley farecompression-based algorithms or location-based searchesis such a far cry from what we normally think of as improving the common good.
Civic tech is what we find at the intersection of digital technology and actual public challenges. Civic technology describes the field of technologists, activists, and public intellectuals who are genuinely trying to develop tools that help us make the world a better place. Its what you get when you treat improving the public sphere as something more than a buzzword.
Civic technology describes (at least) three distinct types of technology projects:

Government directly engaging with citizens. This can be as simple as e-government efforts that upgrade citizen-facing websites and make government services easily accessible. It has been extended further to include SeeClickFix and AskThem.ioservices which encourage citizens to directly engage with public officials and make their voices heard, but not through .gov websites or portals. Social petition sites like Change.org and the White Houses We The People petition platform also belong in this vein of civic technology.
Government transparency efforts. A previous generation of civic reformers focused on opening up government data through laws and regulations like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). They rallied behind Louis Brandeiss famous observation, sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants. But most of the transparent data from years past is hidden in filing cabinets, accessible only to the most intrepid investigators. A major trend in civic technology is to render government actions practically open and meaningfully accessible.
Citizens engaging with each other. This third branch of civic technology can also be called activist technology. When citizens collaborate to develop a shared understanding of the challenges their communities face, they are well on their way to becoming members of that slim slice of the public that actually engages with politics and civic life outside of elections. The challenge for this third branch is that activist technology often becomes partisan technology, and faces particular partisan challenges (movement-building, funding, government regulation) as a result.

Civic technology initiatives dont always work. They can have unintended consequences. They can be overly idealistic. They can be based upon overly-rosy assumptions about how governments, partisans, and mass publics will behave. Many well-intentioned civic tech projects fall prey to what I have termed the Field of Dreams Fallacy.
But it is hard not to feel genuine hope when looking at the civic technology sector. These projects are formed out of a shared sense that contemporary American government has largely ceased to function. And while technology is certainly not the answer to our governmental problems, the civic tech sector is built on the ideal that new tools can help us fashion new solutions, particularly as the old ones grind to a halt.

Civic Tech 





Responding to criticism of its Internet.org program in India, Facebook announced that it is opening it to more sites and services. Chris Daniels, VP of product for Internet.org, tells Pranav Dixit of the Hindustan Times: Sites and services that are part of the Internet.org platform will need to adhere to three principles: they need to offer a simpler version of their existing service to encourage people go out and explore the broader internet. They will also need to be extremely data efficient because this has to work for [telecom] operators. It cant be a constraint on their networks. So things like video or high-resolution photos arent going to be appropriate for this. He adds, some access is better than no access.


Developers will have to apply for their services to be included in Internet.org, something no one has to do on the real internet. But in Facebooks video announcing the move, Mark Zuckerberg argues that this doesnt contradict net neutrality, condemning his critics as people who put the intellectual purity of technology above peoples needs. (Its tempting to compare Zuckerbergs impassioned speech in this video to the lese majeste tone of Bill Gates letter to his fellow computer hobbyists back in 1976, condemning them for copying and sharing Microsofts software without paying for it.)


Responding to the move, Nikhil Pahwa, a volunteer with SavetheInternet.in, writes that this is still a fundamental, permanent change in the way the Internet works, and that Internet.org is a privacy nightmare because Facebook, your telecom operator and the government will know what you are doing.


Secure content is not currently supported by Internet.org, but according to this exchange between Open Whisper Systems Frederic Jacobs and Mark Zuckerberg, its coming.


Two of the central Twitter activists at the heart of the new civil rights movement, DeRay Mckesson and Netta Elzie, are profiled in next Sundays New York Times magazine by Jay Caspian Kang. The story nicely illustrates some of the online network-weaving that they do constantly, and pushes back gently against the desire of many, older civil rights veterans for charismatic leaders to articulate the movements demands. Oddly though, the piece makes no mention of the origins of the #BlackLivesMatter movement in the wake of the acquittal of Trayvon Martins killer in 2012, leaving the impression that todays wave of activism started this past summer with #Ferguson and the killing of Mike Brown.


In response to the story, Clay Shirky tweets: it seems like just yesterday when Malcolm @Gladwell insisted social media would be largely useless in civic rights campaigns.


John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, takes to Medium to announce a new hub called The Briefing that will provide the public with direct access to the facts about Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, and which will be accompanied by a suite of co-branded social media platformsfrom Twitter to Vine, YouTube to Facebook. Mark me as still curious why the Clinton campaign website doesnt have a blog for these kinds of announcements. Surely they want the traffic and the metadata that comes with it?


Clinton will testify before the House Benghazi committee sometime this month, to answer questions about her email server Deirdre Walsh reports for CNN.com

While observing the Arab Spring from afar, Christina Hawatmeh became frustrated that photos and video taken by protesters were getting lost on social media. In 2013 she founded a company called Protestifya portmanteau of protest and testifythat helps media companies visualize and analyze social media activity around hot-button hashtags. This year, Hawatmeh is rolling out a new Protestify service that connects citizen photo- and video-journalists with media companies so that they can be compensated for their work.
Compensating citizen journalists is an idea that has been tried before, mostly unsuccessfully. If it works this time, it will be because Protestify has other revenue sources, and because, on top of content, they promise curation based on big-data analytics that media companies might not be able to replicate in house.
I didnt expect to build a tech company, Hawatmeh tells Civicist, but I wanted to solve [this] problem and it turned out to be a tech problem.
The problem, as Hawatmeh sees it, is the the disconnect...between mainstream media and people online. While studying at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), she began building a service to help media companies better analyze, visualize, and acquire breaking social media content.
Protestify sold their first images last month but they are only now getting around to automating the copyright agreement. Now, citizen journalists can simply tag their photos or videos on Twitter with #protestify, signalling their interest in selling the material. Protestify then sends them a copyright agreement and puts the photo up for sale on the website. Although the pricing is a bit variable, Hawatmeh says they are comparable to Getty images, averaging $200 per photo. The money is split fifty-fifty between the photographer and Protestify. Their service offers citizens a more equitable way to contribute to the news, says Hawatmeh.
Prior to launching the #protestify feature, the company practice was to reach out to individual photographers about selling their work. Hawatmeh says that they have a 90 percent response rate from users, generally within one or two minutes.
Screenshot of the Protestify content feed in the United States.
Without a doubt there is demand for user-generated content: A recent study by Columbia Universitys Tow Center for Digital Journalism found that, in seven of eight television newscasts, an average of 11 pieces of user-generated content (what could also be called citizen journalism) was shown daily. More than 70 percent of that content was not properly attributed or identified at citizen journalism. The real question is whether news outlets will ever pay for photos and video when there is an abundance of free material.
In 2005, media observer Steve Outing wrote a piece for Poynter headlined Its Almost Time to Pay Up for Citizen Journalism, in which he predicted that photos would be the first thing media organizations would buy from citizen journalists. He cited three then-new online marketplaces for citizen content: Scoopt, Spy Media, and Cell Journalist.
None of the three are still up and running: Scoopt was acquired by Getty Images in 2007 and subsequently shuttered in 2009; Spy Media was sold in a private deal in 2007; and Cell Journalist was acquired by ScribbleLive in 2014. According to a ScribbleLive spokesperson, there was never any compensation for submissions.
When reached for further comment, Parker Polidor, who helped launch Cell Journalist and is now a ScribbleLive employee, wrote in an email to Civicist: We were thinking about paying subscribers (at the beginning phases of the company), but never went forward with any of those plans.
Thomas Quinn, the founder of Spy Media, tells Civicist that citizen content is a tough sell because the internet is a massive cloud where everyone can go in and get anything they want. He adds that verification of ownership was a challenge, and that media companies are afraid of using material from unknown, and therefore less trust-worthy, sources.
Steve Outing, who still covers media news, says that a surplus of content is an additional challenge. At any given event, he explains to Civicist, there will probalby be enough people there that there wont be one person that has the single best photo.
Outing adds that perhaps there is space [in the market] for curation.
That is what Christina Hawatmeh is counting on. Our domain expertise is how to find this content and organize it together, she says. To that end, Protestify employs four hashtag researchers in addition to the development and design team.
Protestify has been enlisted by one agency to build an election-centered visualization around a hashtag that the organization will encourage readers to use, so users can be a part of the process all the way through. The end result will incorporate photos, videos, comments, and a livefeed will run on the media website.
Although Hawatmeh isnt ready to announce any specific partnerships yet, she tells Civicist she has spoken with representatives from the Associated Press, Reuters, and the New York Times. She adds that Protestify currently is user testing with a smaller, younger agency and a large enterprise client. They plan to release details this month.

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina makes her presidential bid official with a tweet this morning. Her online footprint: 357,000 Twitter followers and only about 43,000 on Facebook.


Former colleagues of Fiorina at HP say she mishandled the companys $25 billion acquisition of Compaq and put her own self-promotion first, report Rory Carroll and Rupert Neate for The Guardian. She put herself ahead of the the interests of the company and I fear she would do the same as president, Jason Burnett, a member of the Packard Foundations board of trustees, told them.


The editorial board of the San Jose Mercury News, which watched Fiorinas first bid for public office when she ran for Senate in 2010, says She takes the Silicon Valley motto that its OK to fail a tad too literally.


On Facebook, retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is also making his presidential candidacy official. His online footprint there is bigger than Hillary Clintons at 1.2 million; he also has 326,000 followers on Twitter.


Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raised $1.5 million in the first day after his presidential campaign announcement, with an average donation of $43, Greg Sargent reports for the Washington Post. Sanders money quote: Can I raise a billion dollars? Probably not. But the question is, can I raise enough money to run a grass roots campaign and utilize millions of people? I think we can raise that kind of money.


So far Hillary Clintons campaign hasnt released any details of its early fundraising haul. This story by Glenn Thrush and Anna Palmer in Politico describes the complications involved in putting together a billion-dollar-plus fundraising machine, complete with the competing desires of growing a large, flat structure of many maxed-out individuals giving $2,700 and the much more traditional approach of empowering mega-donors on the East and West coasts and revving up the Priorities USA Action Super PAC.


Sanders has long been a critic of the NSAs mass surveillance programs, reports Dustin Volz for National Journal.


Reporting from London on this weeks upcoming national elections in Britain, Ben Smith of Buzzfeed contrasts the way Britains conservative print titans are bashing Labor Party challenger Ed Miliband with the love being lavished on him by the Internets meme-makers and the million-plus YouTube views his interview with radical Russell Brand has earned.

Given that TV and radio advertising are prohibited in British elections, it makes sense that all the parties contending for power in the United Kingdom are using social media to rally voters, as Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura details for The New York Times. Her story doesnt offer much info on what the campaigns are doing with email or with voter targeting, which as readers know from the American elections, are where real differences in capacity may matter.


Even, a prototype app to help low-wage workers with unsteady cash incomes better manage their money, gets a lush write-up in Sundays New York Times Magazine from Anand Giridharadas. Its a somewhat odd choice for a story given that there are many other early stage start-ups with similar goals that arent based on quite as shaky a premise. But they arent backed by Khosla Ventures or founded by an already successful app maker, Jon Schlossberg, whose developed Unlock to help end the agony of typing in a password every time you awaken your laptop.


The ACLUs new Mobile Justice CA cellphone app enables users to automatically record and send video of their encounters with the police to the organization, Jon Wiener reports for The Nation.


WikiLeaks has relaunched a beta version of its leak submission system, something it has been without for four-and-a-half years, Andy Greenberg reports for Wired.


Hello, Big Orwell: China is planning to assign all of its citizens a social credit rating based on everything from their financial and criminal records to their social media behavior, report Fokke Obbema, Marije Vlaskamp and Michael Persson for Volkskrant. Says Johan Lagerkvist, a Chinese internet specialist based in Sweden, the system is very ambitious in both depth and scope, including scrutinizing individual behavior and what books people read. Its Amazons consumer tracking with an Orwellian political twist. (h/t Cathy ONeill)

In 1945, Vannevar Bush (third from right) wrote, There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.

To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
I recently spent my spring break devouring Red Plenty, Francis Spuffords 2012 novel set in the 1950s Soviet Union. It is a tale of cybernetic utopiathe dawn of a might-have-been perfectly-planned industrial economy controlled by computerswhere the physical world and the digital world are linked together in scientific synchrony. As I read, it became clear to me that the same trends will direct the future of the civic tech movement, bringing both a new scientific sensibility and a decidedly physical dimension to its computations.
Science has been a stranger to civic tech, despite its deep roots in human efforts to deal with the challenge of cities. Take the term civic itself. In civic tech, we use the contemporary meaning of the rights and duties of citizens in relation to their community. But in the late 19th century, the first urban planners used a different meaning as a call to arms. For them, civics described the application of new social science methods to the wicked problems of the industrial city. Civics was about better management, not mass indoctrination.
In the middle of the 20th century, the promise of digital computing breathed new life into these ambitions. Almost as soon people invented the idea of computers, they started fantasizing about using them to predict and control the behavior of society. Early theorists like Vannevar Bush, who oversaw the Manhattan Project, understood that these applications would in fact drive the evolution of the technology. As he wrote in 1945, at the dawn of the information age, There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.
Fast forward to the early 21st century and cities and computers are again evolving together. As the pace and scope of global urbanization accelerates, computing is moving off of our desktops and into the buildings, vehicles and streets around us. Though much of our experience of civic tech to date has happened in the placeless plains of cyberspace, the next great frontier lays in crafting the relationship between citizens and their connected neighborhoods. The social web of our cities is about to get plugged into the internet of urban things.
Im not alone in my hope that new knowledge gained through science can help us build better cities. An archipelago of laboratories spanning the globe has spun up in the last decade, from Boston to Mumbai, to invent the technologies and do the research to understand how cities work, and how to get people to live safer, more productive, more sustainable lives in them. Their approach? Deeply quantitative and heavily computational investigations into the processes of how cities grow, thrive, stagnate, and decline in response to human actions. Behavioral science has made huge strides in public policy recent decades. But we havent seen anything yet.
Civic tech will indeed be transformed by the lessons of this new urban science. But it will also push back against its technocratic urges. Civic techs pioneers have figured out how to thrive on decentralized participation and collaboration, which will be key to understanding and innovating in a messy and fast-changing urban world. The Soviets tried to create a remote control for the entire industrial economy, to control all the factories from the Kremlin. The smart citys scientists will need to learn to know when to loosen the reins. The civic tech movement will show them when and how.

Civic TechSmart Cities 





Hello, world! Today we are launching Civicist, our hub for news and analysis of the civic tech world, with a gorgeous new design. And that means we are going to mothball techPresident (keeping all its content accessible), and convert First Post into Civicists daily news aggregator. For those of you who get First Post by morning email (a benefit of being a Civic Hall member), all that will change is next week, these emails will start coming from a new email address). And well keep sharing First Post online later in the day, but it will now go up on the Civicist site.


Were excited to launch Civicist with a diverse group of contributing editors, including Hollie Russon Gilman, Erhardt Graeff, Marci Harris, Mark Headd, Allyson Kapin, David Karpf, Laurenellen McCann, An Xioa Mina, David Moore, Antonella Napolitano, Matt Stempeck, Anthony Townsend, and Ethan Zuckerman. To kick off our coverage, weve asked them to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? and will be publishing their responses this week and next.


For starters, here is Laurenellen McCann on But What is Civic?, Mark Headd on The Last Mile of Service Delivery, Hollie Russon Gilman on Civic Tech: Empowering the 21st Century Public (Maybe), and Matt Stempeck on A Maddeningly Broad Term.


For more on what Civicist will do, read this. Follow us also @civicist.


Its not often that the tech sector rolls out a new product that may actually change the world, but I will make an exception for the new Tesla home/business battery launch. It will allow solar home owners and electric car owners to substantially withdraw from the grid and quite possibly tip the oil/gas/coal sector towards historys dustbin. Futurist Ramez Naam argues that the economics are almost there.


Nearly two years after Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the US governments massive surveillance programs, Congress is on the verge of major reforms of the Patriot Act, report Jonathan Weisman and Jennifer Steinhauer for The New York Times. They note that The Snowden disclosures, along with data breaches at Sony Pictures, Target and the insurance giant Anthem, have unsettled voters and empowered those in Congress arguing for greater civil liberties protectionwho a few years ago could have met in a couple of phone booths, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.


Snowdens name appears seven times in that front-page story, in fact. A petition on the White Houses We the People site calling on the Obama administration to pardon him, which has 166,771 signatures, has been waiting for a formal response for 22 months.


The House Government Oversight and Reform Committees information technology subcommittee actually has two members with computer science degrees on it, and during a hearing this week they made clear they arent buying the governments arguments for backdoor access to encrypted communications, Andrea Peterson reports for the Washington Post. It is clear to me that creating a pathway for decryption only for good guys is technologically stupid, said one of them, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). You Just cant do that.


Cory Doctorow, a longtime critic of the so-called backdoor key approach, attacks U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron for pushing the idea, writing in The Guardian that:

Making it possible for the state to open your locks in secret means that anyone who works for the state, or anyone who can bribe or coerce anyone who works for the state, can have the run of your life. Cryptographic locks dont just protect our mundane communications: cryptography is the reason why thieves cant impersonate your fob to your cars keyless ignition system; its the reason you can bank online; and its the basis for all trust and security in the 21st century.


Matt Taibbi writes in Rolling Stone that Senator Bernie Sanders presidential campaign should be taken seriously, attacking the mainstream medias focus on early money-raising. He writes: Were conditioned to believe that the candidate who has the early assent of a handful of executives on Wall Street and in Hollywood and Silicon Valley is the serious politician, while the one who is merely the favorite of large numbers of human beings is an irritating novelty act whose only possible goal could be to cut into the numbers of the real players.


As Twitters stock tanks, longtime media analyst Mathew Ingram argues that the company made a critical mistake five years ago when it started cannibalizing and shutting down the third-party developer network that had helped it initially grow, and that it should have become more open and decentralized, not less.


While Sridhar Ramamswamy, Googles senior VP of ads and commerce, is writing here in the Wall Street Journal about how mobile internet use is changing consumer behavior, pitching his argument to commercial brands, everything he says also applies to politics and causes. To wit:

These moments, or micro-moments, are when we act on a needto learn something, do something, discover something, watch something or buy something. They are intent-rich moments where decisions are being made and preferences being shaped. We see them constantly, across billions of monthly searches, billions of hours of videos watched every month, billions of interactions with various sites and apps. These arent just people inattentively tapping things into their phone; they rather are the new battleground for hearts, minds and, with them, the dollars their attention brings along.This is a pretty seismic change for advertisers.

Dear readers:
Were very excited to announce the launch of Civicist, our hub for news and analysis of the civic tech world. Here we will cover the growing ecosystem of people and projects using tech for civic purposes, building on the community-organizing and network-weaving weve done every June since 2004 during Personal Democracy Forum, and now year-round at Civic Hall. Every weekday, well bring you a roundup of the latest news in First Post, which goes out to Civic Hall members in the morning mail and gets posted online later in the day. Throughout the week our team will deliver fresh reporting and thinking on all the ways that this field is taking shape.
With this announcement, were also going to mothball techPresident, the group blog and news site that we started in 2007 to focus on how tech is changing politics. If you are a loyal techPresident reader, dont worrywe are still going to keep an eye on that arena. But with Civicist (pronounced Civik-ist), we are going to focus especially on the ways people are using tech for social good.
This is actually not that big a shift. Weve always been most interested in how tech could be a disruptive force for positive social change, the kind that opens up the political system, empowers more ordinary people, and makes government work better. But we think that the action, and innovation, has shifted away from partisan electoral politics and towards civic engagement, broadly defined. That said, civic techs precise meaning is still being forged as its practitioners keep discovering the best ways to do everything from partner with government, build on government data, influence government to move in a particular direction, co-create services with government, or even create their own freestanding civic services that solve a community need without direct reliance on government. As my sage old friend Andrew Kopkind might have said were he still around, its meaning hasnt been fully meaned yet.
We think of civic tech as a big tent. It includes civic appstools or platforms designed primarily for a civic purposebut it also encompasses big apps or platforms that have civic effects. That comprises everything from SeeClickFix or NationBuilder in the former case, to Yelp (when people use it to review government services) or Google (with its Civic Information API) in the latter. People working to upgrade governments use of technologygovtechare certainly part of the civic tech ecosystem when their efforts involve engaging with the public. The same goes for political technologya candidate or issue campaigns efforts to mobilize the public inevitably also involves drawing people into civic life. Were taking a broad view, and plan to keep an eye on developments globally, as well.
Weve recruited a diverse group of contributing editors who will enrich this conversation with their own insights and observations. They include: Hollie Russon Gilman, Erhardt Graeff, Marci Harris, Mark Headd, Allyson Kapin, David Karpf, Laurenellen McCann, An Xioa Mina, David Moore, Antonella Napolitano, Matt Stempeck, Anthony Townsend, and Ethan Zuckerman. To kick off our coverage, weve asked them to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? and will be publishing their responses this week and next. Jessica McKenzie, our managing editor, and I will contribute our own feature reporting, and well also commission feature pieces from freelancers and post occasional op-eds from other voices. (If youd like to join in, either as a contributing editor, freelancer or op-ed writer, drop Jessica a note at jessica@civichall.org.)
While Civicist is cross-partisan, it is not neutral. Were opinionated. Tech is not an apolitical force in society; it can be used for good or for bad. When we say civic tech we mean the use of tech to improve the conditions of all. We agree with Zephyr Teachout when she argues that the opposite of corruptionthe use of public power for private purposesis love of the public.  Its for this reason that we have occasionally editorialized on behalf of causes like net neutrality or internet freedom. To us, todays civic activism is focused on searching for what it takes to make the promise of a democratic and just society for all a reality, and how wise use of technology can assist in that quest.
As we launch this new chapter, a word about our past is in order. Civicist is a continuation of our old news site techPresident, which itself grew out of our very first group blog, PersonalDemocracy.com. The latter took shape in the fall of 2004, after we held the inaugural Personal Democracy Forum at the New School in New York City. We started PersonalDemocracy.com to continue the conversation about technologys impact on politics that made that first PDF so inspiring. If you dig deep into its archives you can find some seminal writing by the likes of Christian Crumlish (on the rise of wikis and Meetup.coms business model), Chris Nolan (on MoveOn.orgs roots in flying toaster ovens), Brian Reich (on DailyKos.com as a new kind of political machine), and Matt Stoller (on the rise of the netroots). In February 2007, we decided to rebrand that blog as techPresident, with a tighter focus on the 2008 election, since it was clear then that the internet was going be a much bigger factor in that contest. Our tagline was: How the candidates are using the web, and how the web is using the candidates. When techPresident launched we had a cross-partisan group of bloggers that included David All, Michael Bassik, Zack Exley, Allison Fine, Mindy Finn, Steve Garfield, Noel Hidalgo,  Lynne d Johnson, Matt Ortega, Patrick Ruffini, Ari Melber, Alan Rosenblatt, Liza Sabater, Ruby Sinreich, Fred Stutzman, Zephyr Teachout, Michael Turk, and David Weinberger, and its our hope that the new group joining here to help launch Civicist will be equally creative and provocative.
A little more housekeeping: Between PersonalDemocracy.com and techPresident.com, theres a rich archive of more than 14,300 posts to dig into, as well as an assortment of PDF conference videos, podcasts, and a smattering of special reports. Were going to keep all that content up for as long as we can. And were going to put Personal Democracy Plus to bed and make the content there free instead of keeping it behind a paywall. (Old subscribers to Personal Democracy Plus are being converted to Civic Hall community members and your daily subscription to First Post will continue.)
Finally, in addition to covering the world of civic tech, Civicist is also going to cover the community of Civic Hall, our newborn center for civic innovation in the heart of Manhattans Flatiron District. The people who belong to Civic Hall and come to its events are a vibrant part of the civic tech movement, and when their work strikes us as important or path-breaking or worth celebrating, well share that here. In just three months, Civic Hall has grown to more than 300 paying members, representing a broad range of organizations including government agencies like the New York Attorney Generals office and NYCs 311 system, as well as non-governmental organizations like Code for America and BetaNYC and companies like Change.org and NationBuilder. In the coming weeks, well be adding a more robust calendar of events as well as a web portal for Civic Hall members to use for networking with each other. To stay on top of all of this, you can sign up for our free weekly external events newsletter, or come join as a member to get the First Post inside scoop and internal events calendar delivered to you directly. And watch this space: were not done growing up!

Civic HallCivic Tech 



To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
When did we stop talking about democracy? Thats the thing I get stuck on when I think about civic tech and the confusion around what it is or isnt. When did we start blurring the word civic into the word tech?
I first came into the orbit of what we now call civic tech through the open culture and freedom of information movements in the mid-2000s. Back then a lot of the work was called Gov2.0 and e-gov. Digital democracy. I dont remember the first time I heard the phrase civic technology, but I think it was used the way I think about it now, with the weight on civic.
Civic technologies are tools we use to create, support, or serve public good. Thats it. Full stop. Thats literally what it means. We often use it to describe digital technologies highly focused on government services (the inheritance of Gov2.0), but thats only because these projects identify as such. They call themselves civic tech. So, we think of them as civic tech. But if were holding ourselves accountable to that wordcivicthe world of civic tools is much greater.
What is civic? Variously defined, civic describes citizenshipor, better, the aspects of living in society. Sure, governments are key to making society function, but theyre just one of many actors. Journalists and artists, civil servants and entrepreneurs, parents and teachers, public health workers and neighborhood activists: the civic sphere exists where these and other roles meet. Its the public square, the array of physical and digital spaces where communities connect with each other.
Laurenellen McCann at the Code for America Summit 2015 (Preston Rhea)
When we narrowly define civic tech as tools that we the people (or we the companies) build for governments, we miss whole swaths of public activity and public advocacy. In fact, we miss what it means to live in a democracy. Of course investing in government services is one way to impact the civic space, but its not like people are sitting around waiting for good to be done to them or made for them when the governments not around. Being human, we are wired to work together, to build with each other, to make our lives better. Thats what we do, with whatever tools are available. We see problems or opportunities for improvements and we work to the best of our ability to create change.
Thats why community tech has a place beside government tech in the halls of civic tech. Civic is the macro picture of the micro activity that describes how we live and govern together. And its the breadth, complexity, and diversity of the civic arena that compels us to value tech not just as whatever tools are in vogue, but whatever tools get the job done. Technology describes everything from knitting needles to spaceships. When we limit tech to anything else, we change the meaning of public good and we limit the tools available to us to make our lives better.
And isnt that the goalto make our lives better? Isnt that why we care about how our governments function at all? Because we believe in equity? Because, more than just a more functional government, we want a more functional democracy?
If that isnt the goal, what is?

Civic TechDemocracy 







To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
When Aristotle concluded man is a political animal, he identified a core tenet of human nature. People want to be seen and heard. People want to feel connected to one another. I became interested in the opportunities for technology to enhance democracy when I witnessed the 2007 Iowa caucus. Much of the civic learning at the time came from face-to-face participation, in-person dialogue, and deliberation with new people. I realized digital tools could potentially reduce the barriers to entry in this arena, but realized that in the noisy ruckus of people coming together, some speaking and listening would inevitably be lost. I left Iowa believing in the potential as well as the perils of digital tools for political participation.
I was inspired to study this further after serving as an organizer for the Obama campaign. It was there that I got to experience the rush of trying to mobilize, organize, and galvanize people. The campaign brought out all types of people who were unified in working towards a better future. But what happens the day after the election?
This is where civic tech comes in. Civic tech provides an opportunity to engage citizens in governance beyond simply voting every two to four years. Civic tech promises a more egalitarian public sphere. Civic tech is about deepening democracy. This definition is much more expansive than efficient public service delivery. It also relates to the deeper reason that people agree upon democratic governance in the first place. Of course, the promise of civic tech is tempered by the reality of people, politics, and institutions.
How do we grapple with political incentives and technology in real life? This is again where civic tech comes in. One dimension of civic tech is being realistic about human behavior. People are social beings. People want to do meaningful work and will participate in governance if it is structured well, if it is a social experience, and when they see results. Possible outputs can include new relationships with neighbors and government officials. Outputs are not as simple as the metrics of page views or clicks; engagement should not perfunctory. Furthermore, the follow-up from participation needs to be viewed as a vital component of participation from the outset. The life cycle of civic tech requires iterative two-way communication.
On the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday events that took place in Selma, Alabama, President Obama said:
Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word We. We The People. We Shall Overcome. Yes We Can. It is owned by no one. It belongs to everyone. Oh, what a glorious task we are given, to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.

Of course, this is not confined to America. It applies to all governing institutions that try to represent we the people.
Civic tech is not about the tool or technology. Its about working towards the type of society we want to live it. It has to be aspirational because so too is the democratic ideal. The very idea that a single federal government can govern 300 million people takes faith. So too does civic tech. Civic tech requires believing that the technology of today can usher in a better tomorrow. Though time will tell, the very interest and investment in civic tech presupposes that people have faith.

To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
The most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all.
The term civic technology gets used a lot, and it may mean different things to different people. I think this highlights the fact that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidlyall good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will be broad and durable.
For me, the term civic technology is inextricably related to the world of civic hacking. I began my career in government in what I would describe as the old fashioned way: graduate school to study public administration followed by work on political campaigns. Having now worked for three different state and local governments in both the legislative and executive branches, I consider civic hacking and civic technology to be the future of how governments will deliver services.
Distilled to its essence, civic hacking is the existence of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place, and a desire to effect change on that condition. Thats it. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems. Apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.
In a way, civic hacking is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of open data and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces for interactions with their government. Outside parties have begun developing solutions on top of government-provided or maintained data, often to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency.
For example, in cities like New York and Philadelphia there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the repurposing of vacant properties, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to specific government agencies. These outside efforts are enabled by the deliberate release of property information by the cities like Philadelphia.
Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change the way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and, in many ways, an enormous opportunity.
This, to me, is the essence of civic technology. Civic tech provides solutions to help governments deliver services to citizens more efficiently. We might think of civic apps as a kind of last mile technologythe link between the traditional infrastructure of government technology and the tools people ultimately use to interact with and get information from government.
The most important component of civic technology is that it requires active collaboration between people inside government, including elected officials and government employees, and those outside government, the people in the neighborhoods and communities being served by government.
The old way of delivering government services is over. Civic technologytechnology we build togetheris the future.

Civic HackingCivic Tech

To kick off our coverage here at Civicist, we asked our contributing editors to share their thoughts on What is civic tech? Well publish their answers as they trickle in, and look forward to continuing the conversation in the weeks and months to come.
For the last few years, conversations with strangers, family, and friends have gone a little like this:
What do you do?
I work in civic tech.
Whats that?
Its like tech for good.
Oh, ok.

Thats usually enough to get into an example, like using tech to make cities more efficient with sensors, and shift the conversation. But on stage at a Media Lab alumni panel recently, I realized that saying that civic tech is tech for good sounds pretty vague, and a little self-important. Everyone else on that panel was doing the work they were doing to help others, too: like developing learning software for kids, or designing robotic ankles and exoskeletons for injured veterans and others in need of prosthetics. Besides, judging what gets to qualify as for good is clearly too subjectively influenced by personal political identities and culturally driven ideologies.
Regular tech produces all sorts of civic externalities. The ability to easily, cheaply, and globally communicate with others, even in other languages, is just one example that has created endlessly rippling civic effects, to the extent that the freedom to connect is now a key aspect of the U.S. State Departments international agenda. It doesnt matter if the many people who have spent their lives creating and improving these technologies consider themselves civic actors. Theyve dedicated their careers toward the betterment of humanity.
So our recently emergent field must be a little more specific. Civic tech is when we apply technology toward shared problems and opportunities. (Im pilfering the shared challenges language directly from Aaron Strauss, the executive director of the Analyst Institute.) Technologys daily advance continuously expands the collection of potential ways to improve our society. Civic tech is when we consciously apply technologys new potentials toward societal needs.

As youve probably noticed by now, civic tech is not only a maddeningly broad term, but also a broad field. It encompasses the application of tech in previously distinct fields like government, development, democratic elections, journalism, policy, urban planning, education, youth engagement, humanitarian response, healthy communities, social services, the nonprofit sector, and political campaigns, to name more than a few. Civic tech will remain a maddeningly broad term, but at least we now have a descriptor of what it is we do. The more terms like govtech (a timely rebranding of the decidedly less-sexy government IT) emerge to describe subfields of this space, the clearer our conversations will be.
Digital technology has driven the convergence of these fields just as it has driven convergence of content. Perhaps theyll branch back out again as the digital efforts in each space mature and the sectors adopt better technology, but as of right now, many of the same leaders, funders, and coders are spanning these disparate sectors. For example, actors who would like to remain nonpartisan will downplay the extent to which political campaign tech is part of civic tech, but you need only look at the resumes of many of the key people in this space to find significant back-and-forth between the two. If you look at the history of civic tech, it undeniably involves many of the same people, technologies, and ideas of partisan campaigns. The Howard Dean campaign, for example, was far more successful in jumpstarting Washington, D.C.s tech offerings and inspiring the formation of groups like the New Organizing Institute than it was at convincing primary voters to select Howard Dean.
To help scope and define our field, we can devise a bit of a litmus test by comparing shared challenges and opportunities against selfish ones. Take one regularly debated example, Airbnb. Its a social platform built atop the existing social-physical structures of our homes and cities. The intended use case of finding you a more unique lodging option than the hotel industry provides solves a selfish need (your vacation), rather than a shared need. But when we consider the economic impact of this additional income for hosts, or use scraped data from the platform to better inform the conversation about whether the company accelerates gentrification in our cities, were back in civic tech territory.
We can also think about civic tech from the perspective of resources. Few resources are as vital to cities as physical space. In the consumer technology sector, this has meant starting with the selfish problems we see in early smart home applications: thermostats with the production values of iPhones, fridges that order food for us, and entertainment centers that span all of our rooms. In civic tech, it means projects to repurpose ancient payphones to provide free public wifi, or deploy sensors to apartment buildings to help tenants ensure their landlords provide heat to their apartments.
Theres nothing inherently wrong with using tech to solve selfish challenges; that individualist approach has made us more productive and led to so much of this technological revolution. Advanced technologies are initially marketed to the very wealthy, but they do get cheaper in a historically small amount of time. Its just that the rest of the world is getting a little fatigued with tech that merely helps the already-privileged level up.

Our field, to the extent we choose to define it, is focused on acting around shared, democratic issues. Were working in ways that academics refer to as prosocial. In case you havent spent much time in grad school, prosocial was introduced as the antonym of antisocial. Prosocial behavior covers the broad range of actions intended to benefit one or more people other than oneselfbehaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, and cooperation. (C. Daniel Batson in The Handbook of Social Psychology.) Prosocial behavior need not be motivated by altruism; it is simply the action of aid.
Our efforts are aimed explicitly at helping people with the new possibilities afforded by information and communication technologies. In some cases, thats a direct link: doing the hard work of updating complex healthcare systems to use digital health records will help people because digital records trump the efficiency and efficacy of paper records.
In other contexts, the clear need to upgrade antiquated technology has simply opened the door to reinventing government and civil processes that havent been updated in decades. The technology is our excuse to reinvent. As Code for America proclaimed at their Summit last year, Were not here to change government websites. Were here to change government. What weve found in recent years is that more and more traditional institutions, from the Red Cross to the Department of Treasury, are inviting us in: first to fix the printers, then to fix the websites, and eventually, in more and more cases, to refresh the institutions themselves.

There will be a Democratic presidential primary: Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has announced formally that he is running for president. Compared to Hillary Clinton, he enters the field with a much smaller digital footprint: 294,000 Twitter followers (and thats to his official Senate accounthis official personal campaign account has just 11,600) to her 3.45 million; and 301,000 likes on Facebook compared to her 787,000. Still, Sanders economic populist message may give him surprising tractionfor years he has successfully appealed to many of his states more conservative and independent voters despite being an avowed socialist. It will be interesting to see if the mainstream media, which has essentially anointed Clinton the Democratic nominee, gives Sanders a fair shake, and also how the new media ecosystem, which has made more room for previously ignored or suppressed voices, responds to his campaign.


With Section 215 of the Patriot Act due to sunset on June 1, the Senate appears increasingly likely to pass the USA Freedom Act, ending most authority for bulk data surveillance of Americans, writes Greg Sargent for the Washington Post.

David Simon on why the Freddie Gray death has been a huge catalyst for protests in Baltimore, interviewed by the Marshall Projects Bill Keller:

Because the documented litany of police violence is now out in the open. Theres an actual theme here thats being made evident by the digital revolution. It used to be our word against yours. It used to be said  correctly  that the patrolman on the beat on any American police force was the last perfect tyranny. Absent a herd of reliable witnesses, there were things he could do to deny you your freedom or kick your ass that were between him, you, and the street. The smartphone with its small, digital camera, is a revolution in civil liberties.


Observing the tightening relationship between big legacy news publishers and the giant platforms (read: Google, Facebook) through which many people now get their news, Columbia Universitys Emily Bell writes in the Columbia Journalism Review that  no one really knows where this new, closer partnership approach is leading. But then she offers a hint, quoting Kara Swisher of Re/code, speaking of how the platforms will likely behave: They will pet you, then later on, when you are dependent on their traffic, they will start charging you. Its a bad idea.


If you spend a lot of time worrying about your organizations list size, open rates and web traffic, you arent really getting a real measure of your members engagement, argues veteran progressive online strategist Colin Holtz. Hes the author, with advisors Jackie Mahendra and Michael Silberman, of a major new report on how to get past these vanity metrics produced for Greenpeaces Mobilisation Lab and the Citizen Engagement Lab. Heres a sampling of their findings:
Right now, our metrics bias us towards recruiting the most new members, not the right new members.
You can increase actions taken just by sending lots and lots of petitions with little substance.


People engage in all sorts of tactics that hit short term goals at the cost of long-term engagement.

More people say they regularly get news about politics and government from Facebook than from CNN or Fox News, the new Pew Research Center annual journalism survey reports. In the last week, 48 percent of adults surveyed said they got such news from Facebook, compared to 44 percent for CNN, 39 percent for Fox, and just 9 percent from Twitter.


Another more surprising finding from the survey: 24 percent of adults say they use Google Plus vs. just 21 percent for Twitter. Facebook users are more likely to say they get political news from that service than Twitter users (62 percent vs. 40 percent). So-called consistent liberals are somewhat more likely to say they get news from Facebook or Twitter, compared to consistent conservatives.


Complicating the filter bubble theory, among those people who pay attention to posts about government and politics on Facebook, the large majority75 percentsay that the posts they see are in line with their views only some of the time or not too often. But people who are consistently liberal or conservative are more likely to say the posts they see are indeed always or mostly in line with their views47 percent of consistent conservatives say so and 32 percent of liberals. Similarly, those two groups are more likely to block others they disagree with, with 44 percent of consistent liberals saying they have done so and 31 percent of consistent conservatives. So, some self-sorting by ideology is going on, but its not clear whether the trend is getting stronger (as this anecdotal story by Nick Corsaniti in the New York Times suggests, saying that the intensifying presidential election conversation is leading more people to unfollow people they disagree with), or not.


In 2014, false information about Ebola and Obamacare on Twitter outnumbered factually correct information by an overall ratio of three to one, finds a new study by Andrew Guess of Columbia University for the American Press Institute.


According to this report by Sam Brodey and Jenna McLaughlin for Mother Jones, yesterdays riots in Baltimore didnt start with social media spreading word of a crime-spree purge, but with police apparently charged up by those rumors stopping busses full of students on their way, corralling them, and then marching on them.


Media analyst Jonathan Albright delves into how journalists covering the live events in Baltimore have used Twitters Periscope app to good effect. (Everything about his piece is great except the notion that, in the age of Livestream and UStream, sharing live news video is somehow new.)


Finally, someone says the obvious: Whether its the new Apple Watch or the latest company IPO, no one in tech journalism really knows where anything is going. So says Mat Honan, Buzzfeeds San Francisco bureau chief. He writes, Anyone who pretends to know the future is fooling you. Or themself. We are barely muddling our way through the present.

BaltimoreUprising.org is one hub for information about the protests against police violence in Baltimore.


This data journalism story from last Septembers Baltimore Sun catalogues the many cases where the city has paid out settlements to residents beaten by police.


Riots in Baltimore yesterday began with word spreading on social media of a purge, according to The Baltimore Suns Justin Fenton and Erica Green, a reference to a movie where crime becomes legal.


Baltimore Orioles COO John Angelos connects the dots in a very different way, in a series of tweets summarized here on USA Today. The key lines, after he condemns the riots:
...my greater source of personal concern, outrage and sympathy beyond this particular case is focused neither upon one nights property damage nor upon the acts, but is focused rather upon the past four-decade period during which an American political elite have shipped middle class and working class jobs away from Baltimore and cities and towns around the U.S. to third-world dictatorships like China and others, plunged tens of millions of good, hard-working Americans into economic devastation, and then followed that action around the nation by diminishing every Americans civil rights protections in order to control an unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.



Caitlin Dewey of the Washington Post draws on the work of SocialFlow data scientist Gilad Lotan to explain why #FreddieGray hasnt trended nationally on Twitter, as of yet.


Body cameras on police officers are coming, but as Robinson Meyer reports for The Atlantic, theres little agreement about their usefulness. As Emily Shaw of the Sunlight Foundation tells him, while the footage collected is very clearly a public interest record, such videos are also just full of private information.


Three of the most justifiably paranoid people in the world, Ai Weiwei, Laura Poitras and Jacob Applebaum, meet up in Beijing to make an art project for Rhizome, and Fusions Kashmir Hill is there to document the event.


A group of American whistleblowers including Daniel Ellsberg and Thomas Drake announced their support for the Surveillance State Repeal Act, Dan Froomkin of The Intercept reports.


Security expert Bruce Schneier says its time for the FBI to stop suppressing coverage of the Stingray cell phone interception tool being used by various law enforcement agencies, especially since amateurs and criminals can make their own  and that the real issue is that our cell phone networks are too vulnerable in the first place.


A new bill introduced by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) would increase the penalties for cyber criminals who obtain information from a protected computer without authorization. Zack Whittaker of ZDNet writes that this new bill directly counters Aarons Law, which aims to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to take into account non-malicious Internet activities.


Self-described #ClintonMan Tom Watson, an expert on philanthropy, uses his Forbes.com column to defend the Clinton Foundation, stating that In the world of big American philanthropy, the Clinton Foundation is remarkably transparent. He also says that it should come under greater scrutiny than most other U.S. charities given its past, present and future connections to government.


Yesterday, Mike Allen of Politico highlighted the fact that Per Facebook, the video of Obamas Anger Translator bit from Saturdays [White House Correspondents Association] dinner has been viewed 25 million times, calling it HOT ONLINE. I beg to differ. This is a vastly inflated number, since Facebook actually counts a video view...as a view of three seconds or more...including those that come to life as people scroll through News Feed. A much more relevant number is how many times the video has been liked (488,000 times as of this morning) or shared (665,000). Facebook now says the video has gotten 31 million viewsbut the number of likes its gotten only increased about 58,000 since yesterday.


Compared to the George W. Bush Foundation, the Clinton Foundation is more transparent in disclosing all of its donors, Peter Overby and Domenico Montanaro report for NPR. The Bush Foundation just lists its corporate backers with no amounts included.


NY political journalist Errol Louis says in the Daily News that we shouldnt define corruption down, writing that Hillary Clintons defenders simply say the slippery mix of money, shmoozing and private promises exchanged with foreign players doesnt constitute a crime.We can surely do better. It should be unthinkable for a candidate for the Oval Office to accept money from foreign sources, and voters should never miss an opportunity to say soto pollsters, to candidates and most of all to each other.


Veteran tech strategist and promoter Sylvia Paull reminds us that if billionaires like those being minted by the tech industry just paid all their workers, including those doing low-end service jobs, a much higher salary, they wouldnt be as rich but then the foundations they endow wouldnt have to dole out so much charity.

It looks like last years successful campaign to defend net neutrality just claimed a collateral win: as Jonathan Mahler writes in the New York Times, regulators attitudes toward the proposed, now sunk, Comcast-TimeWarner merger were shaped by fears that the combined company would be too big. At the end of the day, he writes, the governments commitment to maintaining a free and open Internet did not square with the prospect of a single company controlling as much as 40 percent of the publics access to it.


Harold Feld of Public Knowledge goes deep on why the FCC balked at the Comcast-TimeWarner deal.


House Speaker John Boehner tells Bloombergs Mark Halperin that the House might subpoena Hillary Clintons personal email server if she doesnt turn it over for independent investigation. Said Boehner:
She violated the law, and the idea that she was going to use her own server and do official business on it goes against every transparency issue that the President likes to tout. At some point, they just cant ignore the fact that there are a lot of public documents on this server that the American people have a right to see. And we believe that its time for Mrs. Clinton to turn that server and all those documents over to the IG, the Inspector General, at the State Department.



Todays must-read: Top Republican social media strategist Vincent Harris gets a big fat plug from Austin-based freelancer Tom Bartlett in Politico Magazine, in the course of a long and somewhat confused feature story on how the GOP is still trying to catch up to Dems in the use of tech and data. Last fall, Harris switched from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in the presidential sweepstakes, and his teams success getting candidates to use the latest social media tools is highlighted throughout the story. Also featured in Bartletts story: veteran Republican strategists Patrick Ruffini, Mindy Finn and Chuck DeFeo, and ex-GOPer Katie Harbath, now at Facebook.


One sign that Bartlett doesnt quite get the role of tech in winning campaigns is this sentence: To beat [Hillary Clinton]  or whomever the Democratic Party picks as its nomineethe GOP is going to need an adventurous candidate whos willing to wade into uncharted online waters, be it Meerkat or whatever next years hot new thing turns out to be... Yeah, whatever. Its a Meerkat election. (Bartlett also mistakenly reports that Clintons self-advertised plan to build a tech team of 1,000 would make it three times larger than Obamas in 2012 when in fact he had close to 500 staff working on tech.)
